DELTA-NEUTRAL
TRADING
D elta-neutral trading cantake on a variety ofdifferent forms and
encompasses much more material than can be covered in this
one chapter.There are delta-neutral strategies designed to gen-
erate profits,as well as delta-neutral strategies designed to protect prof-
its. In this chapter, the basic concept of delta-neutral portfolios is
discussed,and an example is used to demonstrate how trading a delta-
neutral position can generate profits.
Before discussing delta-neutral trading, it is worthwhile to review the
concept of the “delta”of a financial instrument (stock, option, future,
and so on).Extending the definition stated in Chapter 4,“The Greeks,”
the delta ofa financial instrument is the change in value ofthat instru-
ment when the price ofthe underlying stock (or index) increases by $1,
while all other influences are held fixed.The delta can be either positive
or negative depending on whether the value ofthe financial instrument
increases or decreases in response to a $1 increase in the stock price.
To review the concept of the delta,let’s see how it applies to some sim-
ple stock and options positions:
■ As an almost trivial case,suppose the financial instrument is
that of being long one share of XYZ stock.If the price of XYZ
increases by $1,the long position of one share increases in
value by $1 and hence the delta = 1.00 [1.00/1.00 = 1.00].
Likewise,if the financial instrument is that of being long
100shares of XYZ and the price of XYZ increases by $1,the
value of the long position increases by $100,and hence the
delta = 100 [100/1.00 = 100].

■ Suppose that the financial instrument is that of being short one
share of XYZ stock.If the price of XYZ increases by $1,the
short position of one share decreases in value by $1 and hence
the delta = –1.00 [–1.00/1.00 = –1.00].Likewise,if the financial
instrument is being short 100 shares of XYZ and the price of
XYZ increases by $1,the value of the short position decreases
by $100,and hence the delta = –100 [–100/1.00 = –100].
Let’s also look at the delta ofthose cases where the financial instrument
is an at-the-money option on XYZ. In each case, we assume that the
price of XYZ stock is initially at $30.
The price of an at-the-money call option will typically increase by $.50
when the price of the stock increases by $1, and hence it has a delta
= .50 on a per-share basis. So, if the $30 call has a price of $2, and
XYZ stock goes up to $31, the price of the $30 call should increase to
$2.50 [2.00 + (.50 × 1.00) = 2.50]. Because 1 call contract represents
100 shares of stock,it follows that 1 long at-the-money call has a total
delta = 50 [.50 ×100 = 50].
For a short $30 call,the position has a delta = –.50 on a per-share basis.
Accounting for 100 shares ofstock in the contract,the position ofbeing
short one at-the-money call has a total delta = –50 [–.50 ×100 = –50].
The price ofan at-the-money put option will typically decrease by $.50
when the price ofthe stock increases by $1.So,ifthe $30 put has a price
of $1.75, and XYZ goes up to $31, the price of the $30 put should
decrease to $1.25 [1.75 + (–.50 ×1.00) = 1.25].Because 1 put contract
represents 100 shares of stock, it follows that one long at-the-money
put has a total delta = –50 [–.50 ×100 = –50].
For a short $30 put,the position has a delta = .50 on a per-share basis.
Accounting for 100 shares ofstock in the contract,the position ofbeing
short one at-the-moneycall has a total delta = 50 [.50 ×100 = 50].
When the strike price of the call or put option is deeper in-the-money,
the magnitude ofthe delta increases.Analogously,when the strike price
is further out-of-the-money,the magnitude of the delta decreases.For
example,a long XYZ $25 call might have a delta = .75,whereas a long
XYZ $40 call might have a delta = .25. Likewise, a long XYZ $35 put

might have a delta = –.75, whereas a long XYZ $20 put might have a
delta = –.25.
In the preceding discussion,values ofthe delta have been suggested that
are fairly typical ofthe various at-the-money,in-the-money,and out-of-
the-money options.The actual values ofthe deltas change continuously
as the stock price changes.These actual values are determined from the
Black-Scholes model for pricing options.A good market data feed serv-
ice will provide accurate values of the deltas for options in real time.
Now let’s turn our attention to the general concept of a delta-neutral
position for a portfolio that involves a combination of financial instru-
ments.The definition of a delta-neutral portfoliois that the net delta of
all the components of the portfolio is zero.Why is this significant?
The significance of a delta-neutral portfolio is that a small change in
the price of the underlying stock will have essentially no effect on the
net value of the portfolio. In other words, a delta-neutral portfolio is
insensitive to small changes in the value of the stock that governs its
components.
To illustrate the concept of a delta-neutral portfolio,consider one that
is long 100 shares of XYZ stock at $30 and also long 2 XYZ $30 puts
with a price of $1.75 per share.The long stock represents a delta = 100
[1.00 × 100 = 100], while the long puts represent a delta = –100 [2 ×
(–.50×100) = –100].For the portfolio as a whole,the net delta is zero
[100 – 100 = 0].The total value ofthis portfolio is $3,350 [(100 ×30) +
(200×1.75) = 3,350].
See Figure 27-1 for a risk graph that depicts this portfolio.
Let’s see how the value of the preceding portfolio is insensitive to a
modest decrease in the stock price. Suppose the price of XYZ falls to
$29,which then reduces the value of the stock to $2,900.Because each
long put has a delta = –.50 per share,a decrease in the stock price of$1
will increase the value to $2.25 per share [1.75 + ((–.50) × (–1.0)) =
2.25].Thus,the total value of the two puts increases to $450 [2 × (100
× 2.25) = 450]. So, after a decrease of $1 in the stock price, the puts
increase in value in a manner that maintains the portfolio value at
$3,350 [2,900 + 450 = 3,350].

Ifinstead the price ofXYZ stock increased to $31,the value ofthe port-
folio would again maintain the value of$3,350.In this case,the value of
the stock would increase to $3,100,but the value ofthe two puts would
be reduced to $250.
The delta-neutral effect is seen in the risk graph of Figure 27-1. Note
that the short-term profit/loss curve is flat for stock prices near $30.
If the stock price undergoes larger changes (up or down),the net delta
of the preceding portfolio would not remain near zero. Some adjust-
ment would be required to return the portfolio to a delta-neutral sta-
tus.Such adjustments can be employed as part of a trading strategy to
generate profits from a delta-neutral portfolio.
Let’s see how to use a delta-neutral trading strategy to produce profits
from the preceding portfolio that is long 100 shares ofXYZ stock at $30
and long 2 XYZ $30 puts with a price of $1.75 per share. For this

strategy to be most effective,we need for the price ofXYZ to swing back
and forth in a price range centered around $30.
To begin, suppose fairly soon after the portfolio is set up, the price of
XYZ drops to $25.The stock will have lost value,while the put options
will have gained in value. The net value of the portfolio might even
have increased,but not enough to justify cashing out for a profit.The
puts are now sufficiently in-the-money for them to have a delta =
–.75 per share and thus the two put contacts represent a total delta =
–150 [2×(–.75×100) = 150].Because the long stock has a delta = 100,
the whole portfolio has a delta = –50 [100 – 150 = –50].
To bring the portfolio back to a delta-neutral status, we can buy an
additional 50 shares of stock at $25 per share. Then, with a portfolio
that is long 150 shares ofXYZ and long 2 XYZ $30 puts,the net delta is
zero [150 – 150 = 0].
Now move forward in time and suppose the price of XYZ goes up to
$31.The puts would return to a status ofdelta = –.50 per share and for
the two contacts the total delta = –100.With the portfolio now having
150 shares of XYZ,the net delta = 50 [150 – 50 = 50].
To bring the portfolio back to a delta-neutral status,we can now sell the
50 shares ofstock that were purchased at $25.This generates a profit of
$300 [50 ×(31 – 25) = 300].
Now suppose the price of XYZ continues up to $35. The $30 puts
would then have a delta = –.25 per share and for the two contracts the
total delta = –50.For the portfolio,the net delta = 50 [100 – 50 = 50].
To bring the portfolio back to a delta-neutral status, we can buy one
XYZ $35 put for $2 per share and hence a total cost of $200. Because
this new long put is at-the-money, it would have a delta = –.50 per
share,and thus for one contract have a total delta = –50.Then,with a
portfolio that is long 100 shares ofXYZ,long 2 $30 puts and long 1 $35
put,the net delta is 0 [100 + {2 ×(–25)} + {1 ×(–50)} = 0].
Finally,as time continues to evolve,suppose the price of XYZ drops to
$30. The $30 puts would again have a delta = –.50 per share, and for
the two contracts the total delta = –100. The $35 put would have a
209

delta = –.75, and for the one contract the total delta = –75. For the
portfolio,the net delta = –75 [100 + {2 ×(–50)} + {1 ×(–.75) } = –75].
To bring the portfolio back to delta-neutral status, we can now sell
the $35 put,which originally cost $2 per share,but now has a price of
$6 per share.This generates a profit of $400 [100 ×(6.0 – 2.0) = 400].
To summarize the results of this delta-neutral trading strategy, we see
that a total profit of $700 [300 + $400 = 700] was generated by the
adjustments that keep returning the portfolio to a status of zero net
delta.
This example of delta-neutral trading was idealized to illustrate how
the process is intended to work.In reality,it may be considerably more
difficult to achieve these results.One issue not addressed here is the loss
oftime value in the options.This loss will offset some ofthe gains gen-
erated by the delta-neutral adjustments. A related issue is having the
desired cycle of stock price movement occur within the lifetime of the
options.
There are many other portfolios (combinations ofoptions or stock and
options) that enjoy a delta-neutral status,but which may be much less
suitable for trading to maintain the neutral condition. For example,
the iron condor trades discussed in Chapter 24, “Iron Condors and
Double Diagonals,” start out as delta-neutral, but can be difficult to
continually adjust so as to maintainthat status.
