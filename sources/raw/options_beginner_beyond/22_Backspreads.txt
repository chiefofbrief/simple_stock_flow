BACKSPREADS
T hebackspread tradeis usedto take advantage of large moves (up
or down) in the price of a stock or index. A backspread trade
consists of more long options than short options with the strike
prices selected so that the cost of the spread is small and even some-
times can be initiated for a credit.
The main drawback to a backspread trade is that it returns a significant
profit only for large moves in the underlying stock or index.In fact,the
spread incurs its maximum loss when the stock or index has achieved
only a modest move in price at the option’s expiration date.
Let’s begin by looking at a typical example of a bullish backspread
trade:
■ Example 1.In February,XYZ stock is at $19,and you feel that
this stock has the possibility of being at $35 or higher within
the next year.To take advantage of this potentially large move
at little cost,you consider a backspread trade that uses LEAPS
calls that will expire in about 11 months.
Trade:Buy 2 Jan 22.5 calls at $1.70 per share,and sell 1 Jan
20call at $2.80 per share.
Cost = $60 [2(1.70 ×100) – (2.80 ×100) = 60].
Max risk = $310.
See Figure 22-1 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
To better understand this backspread trade,it is useful to think of it as
a combination of (1) one long Jan 22.5 call purchased for $1.70 per
share and (2) a bear call spread composed ofone long Jan 22.5 call and

one short Jan call, which generates a credit of $1.10 per share [2.80 –
1.70 = 1.10]. The idea here is that the credit spread is being used to
finance the cost of the long call.
At expiration, if XYZ is anywhere above $22.5, the cost of closing the
credit spread will be $250 [(22.5 – 20.0) × 100 = 250].The one unen-
cumbered Jan 22.5 call can realize unlimited profit. The break-even
point for the trade at expiration is XYZ at $25.60. At that point,
the long call has a profit of $310 [(25.60 – 22.50) × 100 = 310]. This
exactly offsets the $250 cost of closing the credit spread along with the
original $60 cost to initiate the trade.
Suppose that XYZ has risen to $35 as the January option’s expiration
date arrives.The net profit on the trade is the profit that the unencum-
bered call makes beyond its break-even price of$25.60.In this case,the
profit is $940 [(35.00 – 25.60) × 100 = 940]. The return on this trade
relative to maximum risk is 269 percent.

The maximum risk on the above trade is $310. This corresponds to
XYZ closing at exactly $22.50 at expiration,as seen in Figure 22-1.Then
the two long calls expire worthless,and the short call must be bought
back for $250 [(22.5 – 20.0) ×100 = 2.5].This loss of $250 in addition
to the original cost of $60 to initiate the trade gives a total loss of $310.
If XYZ closes above $22.50,the long calls have some value to offset the
cost of buying back the short call.If XYZ closes below $22.50,it costs
less to buy back the short call. If XYZ closes below $20, the short call
expires worthless and the loss is limited to the $60 cost to initiate the
trade.
Next, let’s look at an example of a bearish backspread trade where we
start out with a credit:
■ Example 2.In October,ZYX is flying high with a price of $76.
You feel that this stock is sure to fall back to the level of $45
over the next several months.Consider playing this scenario
with a backspread trade using March puts,which expire in
sixmonths.
Trade:Buy 2 Mar 65 puts at $4.20 per share and sell 1 Mar
75put at $9.60 per share.
Initial credit = $120 [(9.6 ×100) – 2(4.2 ×100) = 120].
Max risk = $880.
See Figure 22-2 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
This trade can be thought of as a combination of (1) one long
Mar 65 put purchased for $4.20 per share and (2) a bull put spread
composed of one long Mar 65 put and one short Mar 75 put, which
generates a credit of $5.40 per share [9.6 – 4.2 = 5.4]. The credit
morethan pays for the long put,leaving us a net credit of $120 on the
combination.
At expiration, if ZYX is anywhere below $65, the cost of closing the
credit spread will be $1,000 [(75.0 – 65.0) × 100 = 1,000]. The one
unencumbered Mar 65 put can realize unlimited profit.The break-even
point for this trade at expiration is ZYX at $56.20. At that point, the
long put has a profit of $880 [(65.0 – 56.2) × 100 = 880]. This profit

together with the initial credit of $120 exactly offsets the $1,000 cost of
closing the credit spread.
Suppose that ZYX has fallen to $45 as the March 2005 option’s expira-
tion date arrives. The net profit on the put backspread trade is the
profit that the unencumbered put makes beyond its break-even price of
$56.20.In this case,the profit is $1,120 [(56.20 – 45.00) ×100 = 1,120].
The return on this trade relative to maximum risk is 127 percent.
The maximum risk on the above trade is $880. This corresponds to
ZYX closing at exactly $65 at expiration.Then,the two long puts expire
worthless, and the short put must be bought back for 1,000 [(75.0 –
65.0)×100 = 1,000].This loss of $1,000 is offset by the original credit
of $120 to cause a net loss of $880. If ZYX closes below $65, the long
puts have some value to offset the cost of buying back the short put.If
ZYX closes above $65,it costs less to buy back the short put.

If ZYX closes above $75,the short put expires worthless,and we have a
net profit on the trade from the original credit received of $120.So,if
you are completely wrong about this high-flying stock and it fails to fall
over the next six months,this spread yields a small profit.
The basic concept ofthe backspread trade is to finance a long option by
combining it with a credit spread. The standard version of the trade
uses a ratio of two long options versus one short option, as seen in
Examples 1 and 2.It is possible to use other ratios of long options ver-
sus short options.
Let’s look at an example trade that uses a ratio ofthree long calls versus
two short calls:
■ Example 3.In October,ZYX is trading at $28.40.There seems
to be a good possibility that ZXY is about to break out and will
be at $40 within the next six months.Let’s see how we might
play this with a 3:2 backspread trade using April calls.
Trade:Buy 3 Apr 32.5 calls at $.85 per share and sell 2 Apr
30calls at $2.10 per share.
Initial credit = $165 [2(2.1 ×100) – 3(.85 ×100) = 165].
Max risk = $335.
See Figure 22-3 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
This trade can be thought ofas a combination of(1) one long Apr 32.5
call purchased for $85 [.85 × 100 = 85] and (2) two bear call spreads
composed of two long Apr 32.5 calls and two short Apr 30 calls which
generate a credit of $250 [2(2.1 – .85) × 100 = 250]. The credit
more than pays for the long call, leaving a net credit of $165 on the
combination.

Suppose that ZYX has risen to $40 as the April option’s expiration date
arrives. The net profit on the 3:2 call backspread is the profit that the
unencumbered call makes above its break-even price of $35.85.In this

case,the profit would be $415 [(40.0 – 35.85) ×100 = 415].The return
on this trade relative to maximum risk is 124 percent.
Comments
The backspread trade is cheap to initiate, possibly even providing an
initial credit.In comparing the previous examples,note that to have an
initial credit, the strike prices of the long and short options must be
further apart.
These trades have unlimited potential to profit from large moves in the
stock price. If the strike prices of the long and short options are far
apart,a larger move in the stock price is required to produce a profit.
Unlike most spreads, the backspread trade can achieve a maximum
profit if the big move in the stock price occurs before expiration.

Figure 22-3

The maximum loss in a backspread trade occurs at expiration when the
stock price coincides with the strike price of the short option(s). This
loss is always greater than the original debit to initiate the trade.
The backspread trade will require some margin in your brokerage
account. The two legs of the trade that represent a credit spread will
require margin equal to the difference in strike prices between the long
and shortoptions.
