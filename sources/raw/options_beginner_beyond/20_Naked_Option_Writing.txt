NAKED OPTION
WRITING
A s you learn about options,there will come a time when you con-
sider naked option writing. This type of trading can be reward-
ing, but before trying it, you need to be fully aware of the risks
involved in selling naked calls and naked puts.
The word nakedis defined in the Funk & Wagnalls Dictionary as “hav-
ing no covering ...”;this is a particularly relevant description ofnaked
option writing.When you sell either a call or a put without any com-
pensating position to “cover” the short option, you are said to be
“naked.” By having a short naked call or naked put position in your
brokerage account,you are exposed to substantial risk.So,it is impor-
tant to be prepared to manage this type oftrade ifthe underlying stock
begins to move against you.
In the late 1990s, there were some so-called investment gurus who
advised that the quick way to great wealth was to sell out-of-the-money
naked options.They argued that the vast majority of these out-of-the-
money options expire worthless every month and therefore the risk is
minimal. At that time, the emphasis was on selling puts because the
prices oftech stocks were soaring,thereby causing more and more puts
to expire worthless as the Nasdaq moved steadily upward. When the
tech bubble burst in 2000,there were disastrous consequences for those
gurus and their followers,whose naked put positions incurred massive
losses.
Because most brokerage firms forbid naked option writing in a retire-
ment account,this issue may seem irrelevant to people who only trade
153

in that type ofaccount.It is interesting,however,that almost all brokers
do permit covered call strategies in retirement accounts,because a cov-
ered call carries exactly the same risk as a naked put.This was demon-
strated in Chapter 14,“Covered Calls.”
The goal of this chapter is to make you aware of the potential risks as
well as the potential rewards of selling naked calls and puts.Let’s begin
with the risks.
The Risk of Naked Option Writing
You will often hear that selling a naked option exposes you to “un-
limited risk.” Although this is not literally true, the risk can be large
enough to cause considerable loss in you brokerage account.To realis-
tically illustrate the magnitude ofthe risk,we will consider some actual
market situations where substantial losses were generated for those
traders who sold naked options.
■ Example 1.Naked put
In earlyJune 2004,OVTI stock was moving up nicely as the
earnings announcement scheduled for June 9 was approaching.
Many analysts expected the announcement to reveal that the
profits of this high profile company were continuing to grow as
had been reported in the past.With the stock trading a little
over $25 on June 8,it was certainly tempting to sell a few
June25 puts naked for $1 per share.
Suppose that on June 8 you sold 5 Jun 25 puts naked to bring
$500 cash into your account.This looked like easy money
because the stock price seemed likely to continue upward,or at
least stay level,following the expected rosy earnings report.
Also,these options would expire in only two and a half weeks
on June 18,which meant that you did not have long to wait for
the capture of the $500 credit to be completed.See Figure 20-1
for a risk graph that depicts this trade on June 8.
After the market closed on June 8,OVTI issued a statement
that its earnings announcement would be delayed until June 23

due to an internal investigation regarding the need to restate its
earnings for the past year.On June 9,the stock opened at $19
and continued trading down until it closed at $15.50 as the
options expired on June 18.At this point,you would have to
decide between two unpleasant choices:(1) Buy back the
5short puts for $9.50 per share,or (2) accept the assignment
tobuy 500 shares of the stock at $25 per share.In either case,
the value of your brokerage account was diminished by $4,250.
Thereason for this massive loss was that the short Jun 25 puts
were naked.They were not covered by any other position to
limit the risk.
See Figure 20-2 for a risk graph that depicts this situation on
June 18.

■ Example 2.Naked call
In early June 2004,CYBX stock was trading at $18.The
rumorsurrounding this company was that an FDA panel
mightdisapprove its implant device to treat severely depressed
patients.The Jun 20 calls were trading at $3.50 per share.
Itseemed that selling a few of these calls naked might be
profitable,because some analysts projected that the stock price
would only moveup a few dollars even if the implant device
was approved.
Suppose that on Jun 10 you sold three Jun 20 calls naked to
bring $1,050 cash into your account.
See Figure 20-3 for a risk graph that depicts this trade on
June10.

After the close of trading on June 15,just three days before the
options were to expire,CYBX announced that the implant
device had been approved by the FDA panel.The next day,
CYBX opened at $31,and by the expiration date of June 18,
thestock was at $37.At this point,you would have to decide
between two unpleasant choices:(1) Buy back the 3 short calls
for $19 per share,or (2) wait for the assignment on the follow-
ing Monday and be forced to buy 300 shares of CYBX stock at
$37 (possibly even higher) and deliver it at $20.In either case,
you would see an immediate reduction in the value of your
brokerage account by an amount of $4,650.
Again,the reason for this massive loss was that the short Jun 20
calls were naked.They were not covered by any other position
to limit the risk.

Now that you have been sufficiently warned about the danger of naked
option writing, let’s look at one situation in which it might be an
acceptable strategy.
Acquiring Stock with Naked Puts
Let’s see how naked puts can be used as a strategy to acquire a good stock
at a desirable price.An example will be used to illustrate this strategy:
■ Example 3.Suppose that you have carefully researched XYZ
stock.You believe that buying 200 shares of this stock would be
a sound investment for the future.XYZ is currently selling for
$31 per share,and although you are prepared to buy the stock
at that price,it would be nice to get it for a little less.

Figure 20-4

You note that the front month $30 puts are being sold at $1.25
per share.If you sell two of these puts naked,this brings $250
into your brokerage account.By being naked in those 2 puts,
you must be prepared to buy 200 shares of the stock at $30 if
necessary.This must be regarded as acceptable,because you
were already prepared to purchase the stock for $31.
When the front-month options expire,there are two possible
outcomes to consider:
1. If XYZ is above $30,the short puts expire worthless and you
keep the $250.If it still seems like a good investment to
acquire this stock,you can repeat the process for the follow-
ing month.Otherwise,you move on to another stock of
interest.
2. If XYZ is below $30,the short puts will be exercised and you
will be required to buy the 200 shares for $30 per share.Your
actual cost basis for the stock is only $28.75 per share
because of the $1.25 per share that you received from the
sale of the puts.
If XYZ had experienced a pullback to $29,you would still be
buying the stock for an equivalent price of $28.75 per share.
Note how this is much better than having bought the stock at
$31 per share when you initially decided to acquire this stock.
It is wise to have some sort of stop loss strategy in mind when selling
naked options. Think of this as the same as initiating stop loss when
you buy the stock. In the preceding example, if XYZ was at $31 when
you sold the naked put, your mental stop loss might be at $28, which
represents a 10 percent pullback in the stock price. So, if XYZ falls to
$28,buy back the naked put for,say,$2.60 per share.This represents a
loss of $1.35 per share [2.60 – 1.25 = 1.35].Notice that this is a signifi-
cant improvement over a loss of$3 per share that would have been real-
ized if the stock had been purchased at $31.
