IRON CONDORS AND
DOUBLE DIAGONALS
T he iron condor trade and the double diagonal trade are popular
nondirectional strategies.These trades are designed for a stock or
index whose price is expected to remain within a reasonably nar-
row range during a one-to-two-month time period.Both ofthese trades
are credit trades.That is,the initial result of doing the trade is that cash
is brought into your brokerage account. With these credit trades, the
plan becomes one of waiting for the time value of the short options to
dissipate as the stock price moves in a generally sideways direction.
The Iron Condor Trade
The basic setup of the iron condor is to sell one out-of-the-money call
and one out-of-the-money put with strike prices that are about equally
placed from the middle of the price range of the stock. To hedge
these short positions, buy one call and one put that are even further
out-of-the-money.All of these options have the same expiration date.
Because the purchase prices of the long options are less than the sale
prices of the short options,the iron condor creates a net credit.
Another interpretation of an iron condor is a combination of two ver-
tical credit spreads.A bull put spread is established with the short put
strike price near the bottom of the price range of the stock.
Additionally, a bear call spread is established with the short call strike
price near the top ofthe price range ofthe stock.Both spreads have the
same expiration date.The combined credit from both vertical spreads
is the total credit for the iron condor.

The goal ofthe iron condor is to have both short options expire worth-
less and hence retain all ofthe initial credit received when the trade was
initiated.
By using options that will expire in one to two months,the expectation
is that the price of the stock will not have time to drift outside of its
normal trading range.For the maximum return on the iron condor,the
stock price at expiration needs to be between the strike prices of the
short options.
Let’s look at an example of an iron condor trade:
■ Example 1.You observe that XYZ stock has recently been trad-
ing in a range of $50 to $60.In late December,the stock is at
$56,and you decide to set up an iron condor trade using
February options.
Trade:Sell 1 Feb 60 call for $1.85 and sell 1 Feb 50 put for
$1.10.Buy 1 Feb 65 call for $.70 and buy 1 Feb 45 put for $.40.
This creates a net credit of $1.85 per share,thereby bringing
$185 [(1.85 + 1.10 – .70 – .40) ×100 = 185] into your
brokerage account.
See Figure 24-1 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
As Figure 24-1 shows,the best-case scenario is for the price of XYZ to
be between $50 and $60 at the February option’s expiration. In this
case,all the options expire worthless and the original credit of $185 is
converted to profit.
The worst-case scenario arises ifthe price ofXYZ is either below $45 or
above $65. In either of these cases, one of the credit spreads must be
closed for a cost of $5 per share.This results in a net loss on the trade
of $315 [(5.0 ×100) – 185 = 315].
Typically,there is no need to allow the trade to progress to the stage of
a worst-case scenario. As seen in Figure 24-1, reasonable exit points
would be if the price of XYZ falls to $48 or rises to $62. In either of
these cases,the trade could be exited for a loss of about $100.
There is a margin requirement on iron condor trades.Because the two
vertical spreads that make up the iron condor are credit spreads,some

brokers will require margin on both.The more options-friendly brokers
will only require margin on one ofthe vertical spreads in recognition of
the fact that at least one of the two spreads must expire worthless.
The Double Diagonal Trade
The basic setup of thedouble diagonal is to sell one out-of-the-money
call and one out-of-the-money put with strike prices that are about
equally placed from the middle of the price range of the stock. These
two short options have the same expiration date, usually one to two
months until expiration. To hedge these short positions, buy one call
and one put that are even further out-of-the-money,and with at least
one additional month until expiration.Because the purchase prices of
the long options are less than the sale prices of the short options, the
double diagonal creates a net credit.

Another interpretation of the double diagonal is a combination of two
diagonal calendar spreads. A diagonal calendar spread with puts is
established with the short put strike price near the bottom of the price
range ofthe stock.Another diagonal calendar spread with calls is estab-
lished with the short call strike price near the top of the price range of
the stock.Both ofthe short options have the same expiration date.Both
of the long options have the same expiration date, usually one to two
months later than the short options.
As with the iron condor,the goal of the double diagonal is to have both
short options expire worthless. Assuming that the short options do
expire worthless, you will have choices about how to handle the trade
going forward.(1) One choice is to sell the long options for their residual
value,even though they do not expire for at least one month.(2)Another
choice is to sell new options,thereby creating either another double diag-
onal or an iron condor.
Let’s look at an example of a double diagonal trade:
■ Example 2.You observe that XYZ stock has recently been
trading in a range of $50 to $60.In late December,the stock is
at $56,and you decide to set up a double diagonal trade using
February and March options.
Trade:Sell 1 Feb 60 call for $1.85 and sell 1 Feb 50 put for
$1.10.Buy 1 Mar 65 call for $1.20 and buy 1 Mar 45 put for
$.70.This creates a net credit of $1.05 per share,thereby bring-
ing $105 [(1.85 + 1.10 – 1.20 – .70) ×100 = 105] into your bro-
kerage account.
See Figure 24-2 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
As suggested by Figure 24-2, if XYZ is between $50 and $60 at the
February expiration date, the short options will expire and the long
options sold,leading to a profit of $150 to $180 on the trade.
The worst-case scenario arises ifthe price ofXYZ is either below $35 or
above $75.In either of these cases,Figure 24-2 suggests that the trade
will be showing a loss of about $400.
As with the iron condor,there is typically no need to allow the double
diagonal trade to progress to the stage of a worst-case scenario.As seen

in Figure 24-2,reasonable exit points would be if the price of XYZ falls
to $48 or rises to $63.In either of these cases,the trade could be exited
for a loss of about $100.
The margin requirement for the double diagonal trade is essentially the
same as for an iron condor trade.Some brokers require margin on both
diagonal calendar spreads, whereas the more options-friendly brokers
will only require marginon one spread.
Comments
The main advantage of the iron condor is its simplicity at expiration if
the stock price is between the strike prices of the short options. All
options expire worthless and the trade is automatically closed without
the need for any action.No commissions are incurred.

The main advantage ofthe double diagonal is the flexibility it offers for
adjustments. In Example 2, if the price of XYZ moves up toward the
$60 strike price of the short call or down toward the $50 strike price of
the short put,the short February option can be rolled out to a March
option. Alternatively, the Feb 60 calls can be rolled up to the Feb 65
calls,or the Feb 50 puts can be rolled down to the Feb 45 puts;either of
which creates a Feb–Mar calendar spread with no margin issue.
Another advantage of the double diagonal is the possibility of continu-
ation into the next month.In Example 2,ifXYZ is between $50 and $60
at the February expiration, you have achieved a profit, and the long
March options become free positions that can be played for another
month. For example, those long options could be used as the outside
legs of an iron condor for March.
A disadvantage ofthe double diagonal is the decision process that must
take place following the expiration of the short options.Some action is
required to either (1) sell the long options or (2) initiate new short legs
so as to extend the trade for another month.In either case,this neces-
sarily involves some decision about obtaining the best prices. Also,
there will be additional commission charges.
