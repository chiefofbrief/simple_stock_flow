VERTICAL SPREADS
T he most basic option trade is to buy a call or a put depending on
which way you think the underlying stock is going to move. The
next stage of options trading is the use of spreads.In the simplest
spread trade,you buy one option and sell another in order to reduce the
cost ofthe trade.There are a variety ofspread trades,which are discussed
in this book.The focus of this chapter is on vertical spread trades.Of all
the spread trades,these are perhaps the easiest to implement and to follow.
What does a vertical spread offer beyond just buying a call or a put? The
simple answer is that a vertical spread may offer an improved opportu-
nity for profit with reduced risk.
A vertical spread can be one oftwo basic types:a debit vertical spread or
a credit vertical spread. Furthermore, each of these basic types can be
structured as either a bullish or bearish trade.A debit spread is typically
used when you expect the stock movement to occur over an intermedi-
ate to long-term period oftime,whereas a credit spread is typically used
when you want to take advantage of a short-term situation.
Let’s look individually at each ofthese vertical spread trades to see how
they work and when you might use them.We will illustrate each of the
four vertical spreads, which are commonly referred to as Bull Call
Spread,Bear Put Spread,Bull Put Spread,Bear Call Spread.
Debit Vertical Spreads
Bull Call Spread
During July, you decide that XYZ is going to make a significant
moveup over the next four months going into the fall of the year.XYZ
71

is currently at $35 per share, and you feel it will be at $40 or higher
byNovember.
To play this expected rise in XYZ with options,you consider buying a
Nov 35 call for $4.10 per share. But this is an expensive option, when
you recognize that all of the $4.10 is time value. Suppose that XYZ
barely reaches $40 just as this option expires in November.In this situ-
ation, the Nov 35 call option would only be worth $5 per share. This
represents a profit ofjust $.90 per share [5.0 – 4.1 = 0.9],for a return of
just 22 percent on your original risk of $410 per contract.
To lower the risk,consider a bull call spread.
Trade:Buy 1 Nov 35 call for $4.10 per share and sell 1 Nov 40 call
for $2.10 per share.This represents a net debit of $2 per share.
Cost = $200 [(4.10 – 2.10) ×100 = 200].
Max risk = $200.
Suppose that XYZ is $40 (or higher) at the November options expira-
tion.Because all the time value in both options will have vanished,the
difference in their prices will be equal to the difference in the strike
prices,or $5 in this example.Thus,you will have a profit of$3 per share
[5.0 – 2.0 = 3.0], for a return of 150 percent on your original risk of
$200 per contract.
See Figure 10-1 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
Bear Put Spread
During July, you decide that XYZ has no more upside and should
fallback to a lower level over the next four months.With XYZ currently
at $35,you judge that it will drop to the $30 level or lower by next fall.
To play this drop in XYZ with options,you consider buying a Nov 35
put for $3.90 per share.Again,this is an expensive option,because you
are buying only time value.Suppose that XYZ barely falls to $30 as this
option expires in November.This option could only be sold for $5 per
share for a profit of $1.10 per share [5.0 – 3.9 = 1.10].This represents
just a 28 percent profit on your original risk of $390 per contract.

To lower the risk,consider a bear put spread.
Trade:Buy 1 Nov 35 put for $3.90 per share and sell 1 Nov 30 put
for $1.80 per share.This represents a net debit of$2.10 per share.
Cost = $210[(3.9 – 1.8) ×100 = 210].
Max risk = $210.
Now,suppose that your negative view ofXYZ is correct and the stock is
at $30 at the November options expiration.Because all the time value
in both options will have vanished,the difference in their prices will be
equal to the difference in the strike prices,or $5 in this example.Thus,
you will have a profit of$2.90 per share [5.0 – 2.1 = 2.9],for a return of
138 percent on your original risk of $210 per contract.
See Figure 10-2 for a risk graphthat depicts this trade.

Comments
The bull call spread and the bear put spread are debit spreads.For these
trades to pay off, the stock needs to have enough time to move to the
targeted level.For this reason,you want to use options with expiration
months that allow enough time for this move to occur.
To achieve the maximum profit,the stock price needs to have reached
(or exceeded) the strike price of the short option at expiration. The
maximum possible profit is always the difference between the strike
prices of the long and short options less the original cost of the spread.
Typically,you need to wait until near expiration to get the best payoff
from a debit spread.This allows the short option to lose all of its time
value.If the stock reaches (or exceeds) the target price well before the
options expire, the spread will show a profit that is usually much less
than the maximum.

Credit Vertical Spreads
Bull Put Spread
You feel that current circumstances surrounding ZYX are likely to drive
up the price ofZYX in the near future.ZYX is currently at $45,and you
feel that it will surpass its recent high of $50 before the May options
expire in six weeks.
This scenario can be played with a bull put spread.
Trade:Buy 1 May 45 put for $2.70 per share and sell 1 May 50 put
for $5.30 per share.This produces a net credit of$2.60 per share.
Credit = $260.
Max risk = $240.
If ZYX is above $50 at the May options expiration, both options will
expire worthless and the initial credit of$260 will be yours to keep.This
is the maximum possible profit on the trade.In the case ofcredit trades,
the return is calculated from comparing the profit achieved to the max-
imum risk,or 108 percent in this example [(260/240) = 1.08].
The maximum loss of $240 occurs if ZYX is below $45 at the May
expiration date.In this situation,both options must be closed at a cost
equal to the difference in the strike prices, or $5 in this example.
[(2.6 – 5.0) ×100 = –240]
See Figure 10-3 for a risk graphthat depicts this trade.
Bear Call Spread
Due to someweakening of the economy,you foresee a dramatic fall in
the price of ZYX in the near future. With ZYX currently at $45, you
judge that it will fall back to its recent low of $40 by mid-May.
This scenario can be played with a bear call spread.
Trade:Buy 1 May 45 call for $3 per share and sell 1 May 40 call
for $5.70 per share.This produces a net credit of$2.70 per share.
Credit = $270.
Max risk = $230.

If ZYX is below $40 at the May options expiration, both options
willexpire worthless and the initial credit of$270 will be yours to keep.
This is the maximum possible profit on this trade.The profit achieved
as compared to the maximum risk on this trade is 117 percent
[(270/230) = 1.17].
The maximum loss of$230 occurs ifZYX is above $45 at the May expi-
ration date. In this situation, both options must be closed at a cost
of the difference between the two strike prices, or $5 in this example.
[(2.7 – 5.0) ×100 = –230].

Comments
The bull put spread and the bear call spread are credit spreads. These

profit ifthe stock price reaches (or exceeds) the targeted level at expira-
tion. These trades are typically short-term trades that seek to capture
the credit as soon as reasonably possible.
As in the case of debit spreads, the maximum profit is achieved if the
stock price reaches (or exceeds) the strike price of the short option at
expiration.The maximum profit is the amount of the original credit.
Also,as in the case of debit spreads,the maximum profit will typically
be realized at expiration.Credit spreads enjoy an advantage over debit
spreads in that, when their target is reached, no action is required at
expiration.Both options expire worthless.
