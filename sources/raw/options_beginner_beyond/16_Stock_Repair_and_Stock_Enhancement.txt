STOCK REPAIR
AND STOCK
ENHANCEMENT
W e all have experienced the situation in which we buy a good
stock only to see it undergo a significant pullback in price.We
still like the stock and feel that it will recover at least some of
the ground that it lost.There is a low-cost option strategy that can help
you get back to a break-even status when the stock regains only part of
its lost value. The same strategy also can be used to greatly enhance
your profit in a stock for essentially no additional expense beyond the
original cost of the stock.
The stock repair strategy uses options to assist in bringing your stock
investment back to a break-even level. This strategy is structured to
attain the break-even status at a stock price that is significantly lower
than the original purchase price.The great appeal ofthis strategy is that
it involves no additional risk since it can be applied for little or no addi-
tional expense.
Another version of this strategy, referred to as the stock enhancement
strategy, can be used to greatly improve the return on a stock that
you have purchased. As with the stock repair strategy, little or no
additional expense is required. The stock enhancement strategy
provides even greater leverage when the stock itself is replaced by a
cheaper substitute,such as an in-the-money,long-term call with a high
delta.

The basic concept is essentially the same for both ofthese strategies.We
discuss that concept and use examples to illustrate the strategies.
Stock Repair Strategy
For this strategy to work,it is necessary for your fallen stock to make at
least a partial recovery.The stock repair strategy uses options to expand
that partial recovery into a full recovery of your original investment,
with little or no additional expense. If the stock price remains
unchanged or continues to fall,this strategy offers no help.
The basic plan is to buy one at-the-money call for each 100 shares of
stock that you own.You are going to pay for this one long call by selling
two out-of-the money calls with the same expiration date.The idea is
to use the cash received from the two short calls to pay for the one long
call.Choose an expiration month for the options that is far enough out
in time for the price of your stock to recover back to the strike price of
the short calls.
Let’s look at some examples to illustrate the stock repair strategy:
■ Example 1.You bought 100 shares of XYZ back in December
when it was $35.You watched it initially go up,but then
undergo a dramatic slide to its current price in early March of
$23.You still like the stock and feel that there is some hope for
a recovery,although getting back to break-even at $35 seems far
away.Let’s see how stock repair might help.
Trade:Buy 1 Jun 25 call for $3.30 per share and sell 2 Jun 30
calls for $1.75 per share.This actually produces a net credit of
$.20per share [(1.75 ×2) – 3.3 = .20].
Position:Along with an extra $.20 per share in your account,
you hold the combination of a covered call (long 100 shares
XYZ and short 1 Jun 30 call) and a bull call spread (long 1
Jun25 call and short 1 Jun 30 call).See Figure.16-1 for a risk
graph that depicts this position.

Payoff:If XYZ is above $30 at the June options expiration,the
stock will be called away at $30 per share,for a $7 per share
gain over its present price of $23.The bull call spread will be
worth $5 per share.The total gain (including the $.20 credit
received) is $12.20 per share [7.0 + 5.0 + .2 = 12.2],which is
equivalent to a stock price of $35.20.Thus,you will have
reached slightly better than break-even,although the stock is
stillas much as $5 below your original purchase price.
■ Example 2.You bought 100 shares ofYZX back in December
when it was $19.50.Now in early March the stock is down
15percent with a slide to $16.50.Let’s see how stock repair
canget you back to slightly better than break-even in only
10weeks with the stock recovering just 6 percent from its
current level.

Trade:Buy 1 May 15 call for $2.40 per share and sell 2 May
17.5calls for $1.10 per share.This does require a small cash
outlay,specifically $.20 per share [(1.1 ×2) – 2.4 = –.2].
Position:It has cost you an extra $.20 per share to hold the
combination of a covered call (long 100 shares ofYZX and
short 1 May 17.5 call) and a bull call spread (long 1 May 15 call
and short 1 May 17.5 call).See Figure.16-2 for a risk graph
that depicts this position.
Payoff:IfYZX is up by only 6 percent from its current level to
$17.50 at the May options expiration,you will be slightly
better than break-even.The stock will be called away at
$17.50per share for a $1 per share gain over its present price
of $16.50.The bull call spread will be worth $2.50 per share.
Allowing for the small extra cost to establish this trade,the net

gain is $3.30 per share [1.0 + 2.5 – .2 = 3.3],which is equiva-
lent to a stock price of $19.80.Thus,you have reached slightly
better than break-even with the stock recovering less than half
of its loss.
Comment
In comparing Examples 1 and 2, note that the stock repair for 1 was
done for a small credit,whereas 2 required a small debit.The explana-
tion for this is the amount oftime until the options expire (June versus
May). To do the stock repair strategy for little or no cost, it typically
requires options with at least two months until expiration. The more
time allowed,the more likely a credit will be generated.
Stock Enhancement Strategy
Using the same concept as the stock repair strategy,you will see how to
significantly enhance the return on a stock investment. The stock
enhancement strategy uses options to expand the profit on your stock
with no additional cost.A further enhanced return is achieved when a
cheap surrogate is substituted for the stock.
Let’s look at an example to illustrate the stock enhancement strategy:
■ Example 3.In early March,you buy 100 shares of ZYX at $58
per share.Your plan is to hold this stock for the long-term with
a target of $75.
If your target is reached,that represents a nice profit of 29 per-
cent.Let’s see how we can do much better for no extra expense
using stock enhancement:
Trade:Buy 1 Jan 70 call for $3.70 per share and sell 2 Jan
75calls for $2.50 per share.This produces a net credit of
$1.30per share [(2.5 ×2) – 3.7 = 1.3].
Position:Along with an extra $1.3 per share in your account,
you hold the combination of a covered call (long 100 shares of
ZYX and short 1 Jan 75 call) and a bull call spread (long 1 Jan

–3000 –2000 –1000 0 1000 2000
70 call and short 1 Jan 75 call).See Figure 16-3 for a risk graph
that depicts this position.
Payoff:If ZYX is above $75 in 10 months at the January options
expiration,the stock will be called away at $75,for a $17 per
share gain over its purchase price of $58.The bull call spread
will be worth $5 per share.Including the initial credit,the total
gain is $23.30 per share [17.0 + 5.0 + 1.3 = 23.3],which is
equivalent to a stock price of $81.30.This represents a profit
of 41 percent,even though the stock may have moved up by as
little as 29 percent.
Modification:Instead of buying 100 shares of ZYX stock at
$58per share,buy 1 Jan 40 call for $19.70 per share.This option

hasa delta of .87,and hence its price will advance almost dollar
for dollar with the stock price.In this case,the payoff at expira-
tion if ZYX is above $75 will be $21.60 per share [(75.0 – 40.0) –
19.7 + 5.0 + 1.3 = 21.6].This represents a profit of 110 percent
based on the original cost ofthe Jan 40 call.See Figure.16-4for
a risk graph that depicts thismodification of Example 3.
