# Insights: Chapter 1 - Reflexivity in the Stock Market

## THE STOCK MARKET AS LABORATORY

The stock market provides an excellent laboratory for testing reflexivity because:
- Changes are expressed in quantitative terms and data are easily accessible
- Participants' views are usually available in the form of broker reports
- The "prevailing bias" can be aggregated into a common denominator: stock prices

The stock market comes close to meeting the criteria of perfect competition—central marketplace, homogeneous products, low transaction costs, instant communications, large crowd of participants. "If there is any place where the theory of perfect competition ought to be translated into practice, it is in the stock market." Yet there is little empirical evidence of equilibrium or even a tendency toward it. The evidence shows persistent fluctuations regardless of the observation period.

## REFLEXIVITY COMPLEMENTS FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS

"A reflexive model cannot take the place of fundamental analysis: all it can do is to provide an ingredient that is missing from it. In principle, the two approaches could be reconciled. Fundamental analysis seeks to establish how underlying values are reflected in stock prices, whereas the theory of reflexivity shows how stock prices can influence underlying values. One provides a static picture, the other a dynamic one."

"A theory that offers a partial explanation of stock price movements can be very useful to the investor especially if it illuminates a relationship that other investors fail to grasp. Investors operate with limited funds and limited intelligence: they do not need to know everything. As long as they understand something better than others, they have an edge."

### The Critique of Fundamental Analysis

Fundamental analysis assumes the connection between stock prices and companies is one-directional: company fortunes determine stock values. "The possibility that stock market developments may affect the fortunes of the companies is left out of account."

But stock prices influence companies directly through:
- Issue and repurchase of shares and options
- Corporate transactions (mergers, acquisitions, going public, going private)

And indirectly through:
- Credit ratings
- Consumer acceptance
- Management credibility

"The influence of these factors on stock prices is, of course, fully recognized; it is the influence of stock prices on these factors that is so strangely ignored."

### Soros's Counter-Position

"I take a totally opposite point of view: I do not accept the proposition that stock prices are a passive reflection of underlying values, nor do I accept the proposition that the reflection tends to correspond to the underlying value. I contend that market valuations are always distorted; moreover—and this is the crucial departure from equilibrium theory—the distortions can affect the underlying values."

This replaces "the market is always right" with:
1. Markets are always biased in one direction or another
2. Markets can influence the events that they anticipate

"For instance, the stock market is generally believed to anticipate recessions; it would be more correct to say that it can help to precipitate them."

## THE PREVAILING BIAS

Markets have many participants whose views differ. Soros assumes many individual biases cancel out, leaving a "prevailing bias" that finds expression in purchases and sales. A positive bias leads to rising prices; a negative one to falling prices. The prevailing bias is observable in price movements.

### The Underlying Trend

The "underlying trend" denotes changes in fundamentals—but what the fundamentals are has not been defined. "Earnings, dividends, asset value, free cash flow: all these yardsticks are relevant, as well as many others, but the relative weight given to each depends on the investors' judgments and is therefore subject to their bias."

The trend in stock prices is a composite of the underlying trend and the prevailing bias. Both factors are, in turn, influenced by stock prices—creating a reflexive relationship with no constant and no tendency toward equilibrium.

## TWO NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR BOOM/BUST

**First Generalization**: "Stock prices must have some effect on the fundamentals (whatever they are), in order to create a boom/bust pattern. Sometimes the connection is direct... but generally it is indirect. Often it makes its effect felt through a political process, such as changes in taxation, or regulation, or attitudes toward saving and investment."

**Second Generalization**: "There is bound to be a flaw in the participants' perception of the fundamentals. The flaw may not be apparent in the early stages but it is likely to manifest itself later on. When it does, it sets the stage for a reversal in the prevailing bias."

Without these conditions: "Without a change in fundamentals, the prevailing bias is likely to be corrected in short order, as we can observe in the daily fluctuations of stock prices. It would be quite in order to ignore the bias as mere noise... By contrast, when the fundamentals are affected, the bias cannot be left out of account without serious distortion."

## THE BOOM/BUST MODEL

### Definitions
- **Self-reinforcing trend**: Stock prices reinforce the underlying trend (trend accelerates)
- **Self-correcting trend**: Stock prices work against the underlying trend
- **Positive bias**: Prevailing bias helps raise prices
- **Negative bias**: Prevailing bias pushes prices lower

When bias is reinforced, the divergence between expectations and actual future prices widens. When self-correcting, the divergence narrows.

### A Typical Sequence

Soros illustrates the boom/bust sequence with two curves: stock prices and earnings per share. The earnings curve incorporates not only the underlying trend but also the influence of stock prices on that trend. The prevailing bias is expressed only partially by the divergence between the curves—partially it is already reflected in those curves.

**The Path (referencing the figure on p. 56 of the source):**

1. **(A→B) Unrecognized Trend**: An underlying trend exists but recognition is lagging. The trend is strong enough to manifest in earnings per share, but the prevailing bias is negative.

2. **(B→C) Recognition and Reinforcement**: The trend is finally recognized. Rising expectations reinforce the trend.

3. **(C→D) The Test**: Doubts arise, or the trend wavers but reasserts itself. Such testing may be repeated several times. "Typically a self-reinforcing process undergoes orderly corrections in the early stages, and, if it survives them, the bias tends to be reinforced, and is less easily shaken."

4. **(D→E) Conviction Hardens**: Conviction develops and is no longer shaken by setbacks in the earning trend. "When the process is advanced, corrections become scarcer and the danger of a climactic reversal greater."

5. **(E→F) Expectations Become Excessive**: Expectations fail to be sustained by reality. The underlying trend becomes increasingly influenced by stock prices, and stock prices become increasingly dependent on the prevailing bias—both become vulnerable.

6. **(F→G) The Bias Is Recognized**: The bias is recognized as such; expectations are lowered.

7. **(G) The Plunge**: Stock prices lose their last prop and plunge.

8. **(G→H) Self-Reinforcing Decline**: The underlying trend is reversed, reinforcing the decline. If the trend has become overly dependent on stock prices, the correction may turn into total reversal.

9. **(H→I) Stabilization**: Eventually pessimism becomes overdone and the market stabilizes.

"It should be emphasized that this is only one possible path... There could be more than one trend at work and the prevailing bias could have many nuances, so that the sequence of events might require a totally different representation."

## CASE STUDY: THE CONGLOMERATE BOOM

"The key to the conglomerate boom was a prevailing misconception among investors. Investors had come to value growth in per-share earnings and failed to discriminate about the way the earnings growth was accomplished."

### The Mechanism
If a company's stock trades at twice the earnings multiple of acquisition targets, and it doubles its size through acquisitions, earnings per share jump by 50% and growth rate increases accordingly.

Early conglomerates (Textron, Teledyne, LTV) were high-technology companies with strong defense components whose managements recognized their historic growth rate couldn't be sustained. They acquired mundane companies, but as per-share earnings accelerated, multiples expanded instead of contracting. Success attracted imitators. "Eventually a company could achieve a high multiple just by promising to put it to good use by making acquisitions."

### The Bust
"When stock prices started to fall, the decline fed on itself. The favorable impact of acquisitions on per-share earnings diminished and eventually it became impractical to make new acquisitions. The internal problems that had been swept under the carpet during the period of rapid external growth began to surface. Earnings reports revealed unpleasant surprises."

**The Climactic Event**: Saul Steinberg's attempt to acquire Chemical Bank—"it was fought and defeated by the establishment."

## CASE STUDY: REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (REITs)

REITs are a special corporate form that can distribute income free of corporate taxation, provided they distribute all income received. The opportunity remained largely unexploited until 1969 when many REITs were founded.

### The Concept (from Soros's 1970 research report)
"Superficially, mortgage trusts seem to resemble mutual funds designed to provide high current yields. But the analogy is misleading. The true attraction of mortgage trusts lies in their ability to generate capital gains for their shareholders by selling additional shares at a premium over book value."

**The Math**: A trust with $10 book value and 12% return on equity doubles its equity by selling shares at $20. Book value jumps to $13.33; per-share earnings go from $1.20 to $1.60.

"The process is a self-reinforcing one. Once it gets under way, the trust can show a steady growth in per-share earnings despite the fact that it distributes practically all its earnings as dividends."

### Soros's Analytical Approach
"The conventional method of security analysis is to try and predict the future course of earnings and then to estimate the price that investors may be willing to pay for those earnings. This method is inappropriate to the analysis of mortgage trusts because the price that investors are willing to pay for the shares is an important factor in determining the future course of earnings."

Instead of predicting earnings and valuations separately, Soros predicted the course of the entire self-reinforcing process through three reinforcing factors:
1. The effective rate of return on the mortgage trust's capital
2. The rate of growth of the mortgage trust's size
3. Investor recognition (the multiple investors are willing to pay for given growth)

### The Four-Act Scenario

**Act One (The Setup)**: High effective yields on construction loans, low losses, pent-up demand for housing, tight money limiting alternative financing sources. "The self-reinforcing process gets under way."

**Act Two (The Boom)**: If inflation abates, effective yields decline—but a housing boom makes bank credit available at advantageous rates. Higher leverage maintains returns despite lower yields. The premium allows rapid equity issuance, rapid rise in size and per-share earnings. "Since entry into the field is unrestricted, the number of mortgage trusts will also increase."

**Act Three (Saturation)**: "The self-reinforcing process will continue until mortgage trusts have captured a significant part of the construction loan market. Increasing competition will then force them to take greater risks. Construction activity itself will have become more speculative and bad loans will increase." Banks panic and demand credit lines be paid off.

**Act Four (The Bust)**: "Investor disappointment will affect the valuation of the group, and a lower premium coupled with slower growth will in turn reduce the per-share earnings progression."

### Trading the Cycle

Soros invested heavily in mortgage trusts and followed the industry closely. When problems surfaced years later, he reread his original report and was "persuaded by my own prediction." He shorted the group "more or less indiscriminately" and as shares fell, maintained the same level of exposure by selling additional shares short. "I reaped more than 100% profit on my short positions—a seeming impossibility since the maximum profit on a short position is 100%."

**The Insight**: In a self-reinforcing bust, the quality of individual companies matters less than the collapse of the mechanism that sustained them all.

## THE NEGATIVE BIAS OPPORTUNITY

Reflexivity isn't only about bubbles—it's also about constraints.

### Defense Stocks (Early 1970s)
"When defense spending started to rise in the early 1970s after a long decline, there were only two or three analysts left who followed the industry although it still represented a substantial portion of the economy. Those who were left were too demoralized to recognize the beginning of a major new trend. That was a wonderful time to invest in defense stocks."

In this case, there was no self-reinforcing process—investor recognition helped stock prices but the bias was mostly negative. Companies like Lockheed had to be bailed out; others restructured debt at prices that proved very low. "Only when the negative bias was corrected was there very little further feedback: companies had little need for additional capital."

### Technology Stocks (1975-1976)
"After the stock market debacle of 1974, investors were leery of any company that needed to raise equity capital from outside sources."

Distributed data processing was exploding, but companies like Datapoint and Four-Phase "were hamstrung by their inability to raise capital. The stocks were selling at very low multiples of anticipated earnings and the main argument against them was that they would not be able to grow fast enough to meet the demand and eventually IBM would move into the market."

"The argument turned out to be valid, but not before these companies became large and prosperous and investors became eager to throw money at them at high multiples. Those who had been willing to fight the negative bias were amply rewarded."

**The Double-Barrel Return**: When bias shifts from negative to positive, you get earnings growth plus massive multiple expansion.

## TWO TYPES OF REFLEXIVE CYCLES

"What distinguishes the conglomerate and REIT sequences from the venture capital boom is that in the first two cases the underlying trend itself was based on the exploitation of the investors' bias while in the third it was not."

- **Conglomerates**: The idea was to acquire companies with inflated paper
- **REITs**: The idea was equity leveraging
- **Technology**: The underlying trend (new products) had nothing to do with the stock market

"To understand the ups and downs of technology stocks we must know something about the underlying trends in technology; in the case of conglomerates and REITs we need to know little else than the theory of reflexivity."

**The Implication**: "Knowing everything about underlying trends in technology is not sufficient to explain the ups and downs of technology stocks: the reflexive interaction between underlying trends, prevailing biases, and stock prices also needs to be understood. Combining the two kinds of understanding is extremely difficult. Those who want to be familiar with technology must follow the industry closely and continuously; those who want to exploit the divergence between perception and reality must move from group to group."

## FALLOW PERIODS

"Self-reinforcing/self-defeating cycles like the conglomerate boom and the REITs do not occur every day. There are long fallow periods when the specialist in such cycles remains unemployed. He need not starve, however. The divergence between underlying trends and investor recognition persists at all times and the astute investor can take advantage of it."

## THE ANALYST LIFECYCLE

"Most technology experts are ignorant of reflexivity and tend to remain fully invested at all times. Their popularity and influence wax and wane in a reflexive fashion. After the recent decline in technology stocks, a new breed of analysts seems to be emerging who are overly sensitive to the importance of investors' perceptions. After a decent interval it may be once again profitable to go against the prevailing bias and invest in technology stocks on the basis of fundamental trends."

## KEY ANALYTICAL QUESTIONS

When analyzing a company or sector:

1. **Is there a reflexive connection?** Does the company/sector need a high stock price to execute its strategy? (M&A, capital-intensive growth, equity compensation)

2. **What is the underlying trend?** Independent of stock price movements, what is happening to the fundamentals?

3. **What is the prevailing bias?** Positive (expectations running ahead of reality) or negative (expectations lagging reality)?

4. **What is the flaw?** What misconception allows the current thesis to persist? When and how might it manifest?

5. **Which type of cycle?** Is the underlying trend based on exploiting investor bias (like conglomerates/REITs) or independent of the market (like technology)? This determines how much industry-specific knowledge is required.

6. **Where are we in the sequence?** Unrecognized trend? Post-test conviction? Excessive expectations? Recognition of the flaw?
