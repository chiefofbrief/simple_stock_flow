# Chapter 14: Equity Analysis

## The Role of Financial Statements in Valuation

**Historical statements reveal business fundamentals**: While stock prices reflect discounted future cash flows, historical financials reveal competitive position strength, management quality, earnings sustainability, capital allocation discipline, and business model economics. They both provide "a basis for projecting future results" and reveal whether the business possesses durable competitive advantages.

**Core principle**: Financial statement analysis provides "an invaluable reference point for valuation. A stock may temporarily soar or plummet in frenzied reaction to a development of little ultimate consequence. Eventually, however, rationality usually reasserts itself. The share price then returns to a level that is justifiable on the basis of the company's long-range capacity to generate earnings and cash."

## The Dividend Discount Model

Stock price equals the present value of expected future dividends.

### The Formulas

**No-growth companies**:
```
P = D / K
```

**Growing companies**:
```
P = D / (K - g)
```

Where:
- P = Current stock price
- D = Current annual dividend per share
- K = Required rate of return (risk-free rate + equity risk premium)
- g = Expected constant growth rate

**Key insight on appreciation**: "There is no reason for the stock price to rise in the future unless the dividend rises." If dividends grow, "the analyst can incorporate the expected dividend increases directly into the present-value calculation" without forecasting future prices separately. "Value always comes back to dividends."

### Practical Application

**Example**: Company with $1.50 dividend, 9% required return, 7% growth:
```
P = $1.50 / (0.09 - 0.07) = $75.00
```

**Critical sensitivity**: If growth falls from 7% to 6%, fair value drops from $75 to $50. "An analyst whose forecast of earnings growth has a margin of error of one percentage point should not put a strong buy recommendation on [a company] when it is trading at $60 a share."

**Growth-dividend linkage**: If company maintains constant payout ratio, "the growth rate of dividends will equal the growth rate of earnings."

```
Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividends to Common / Net Income Available to Common
```

### The Earnings Quality Adjustment

"Many analysts argue that cash flow, rather than earnings, is the true determinant of dividend-paying capability." Cash flow is "generally more difficult for companies to manipulate than earnings" and reveals whether rising capital intensity is transforming a company "from a self-financing entity into one that is dependent on external financing."

However, "stock prices often drop sharply in response to earnings misses" and earnings remain the market's focus.

**Investor caution**: "Approach adjusted (sometimes loosely referred to as 'pro forma') earnings cautiously. Many companies promote versions designed to divert attention from inconvenient but genuine drags on their performance."

**The defense mechanism**: "Investors can reduce the earnings multiple" by raising the discount rate (K) when earnings quality is questionable.

## The Price-Earnings Ratio: The Practical Tool

```
P/E Ratio = Stock Price / Earnings Per Share
```

Better suited than dividend discount for comparing stocks within industries.

### What Drives P/E Multiples

The expanded form reveals the drivers:

```
P/E = (D / (K - g)) / EPS = Dividend Payout Ratio / (K - g)
```

Three factors determine multiples:
1. **Growth rate (g)** - Higher growth → dramatically higher multiple
2. **Risk/discount rate (K)** - Higher risk → lower multiple
3. **Dividend payout ratio** - Higher payout → higher multiple (but reduces growth)

### The Growth Effect

"An increase in the expected growth rate of earnings produces a premium multiple."

**Example**: Company with 7.5% growth versus 7% for peers:
- 7.5% growth: P/E = 22.2×
- 7.0% growth: P/E = 16.7×
- Result: 33% multiple premium from 0.5 percentage point growth edge

Small sustainable growth differences create large valuation differences.

### The Risk Effect

Higher risk requires higher discount rate, lowering multiples.

**Example**: Same 7.5% growth company, but with higher risk:
- At 9.0% discount rate: P/E = 22.2×
- At 9.5% discount rate: P/E = 13.3×
- Result: 40% multiple compression from 0.5% risk adjustment

**Practical application**: "The ability to vary the discount rate, and therefore assign a lower or higher multiple to a company's earnings, is the equity analyst's defense against earnings manipulation by management." Apply lower multiples when earnings quality is questionable or business risks are higher.

### Why Low Multiples May Be Justified

When management claims their low multiple indicates undervaluation, recognize that analysts likely understand the discount is warranted:

**Business risks**:
- Earnings more cyclical than peers
- Dependence on tax breaks or regulatory preferences that could be rescinded
- High technological disruption potential
- Historical earnings surprises raising earnings management suspicions

**Company risks**:
- Management reputation for erratic behavior (strategy changes, ill-conceived acquisitions)
- Scale disadvantages competing against larger, better-capitalized firms
- Lack of management depth or production concentration risk

**Investment implication**: "The low multiple is a conscious judgment, not a function of neglect." Don't assume low P/E automatically means bargain—understand why it's low.

### The Image vs. Reality Trap

"A company can more easily create a new image than it can recast its operations."

**How to verify claims** (e.g., countercyclical characteristics):
1. "Independently establish whether an allegedly countercyclical business has in fact fit that description in past cycles"
2. "Determine whether the supposed source of earnings stability is truly large enough to offset a downturn"

## Normalizing Earnings: Avoiding Temporary Surges

"Companies have strong incentives to obtain incremental increases in their earnings multiples, even at the cost of stretching the facts to the breaking point."

### When to Normalize

Identify unsustainable earnings from:
- Temporary demand surges (strikes, stockpiling, panic buying)
- Cyclical peak margins (plants at full utilization)
- One-time favorable pricing
- Deferred costs creating artificial profit spikes

### How to Normalize: Trend-Line Analysis

**Steps**:
1. Plot historical EPS over 5-7 years
2. Calculate trend line using regression: y = mx + b
3. Project trend to current year
4. Use trend-line EPS for valuation instead of reported EPS

**Example**: Company reporting $2.67 EPS (inflated) vs. $2.22 trend-line EPS:
- At 20× on $2.67 → $53.40 (overstated by 20%)
- At 20× on $2.22 → $44.40 (normalized)

**Guidance**: "Some modest upward revision may be warranted, for if nothing else, the company can reinvest its windfall profit...By no means, though, should the company be evaluated on the basis of an earnings level that is not sustainable."

## Sustainable Growth: The Only Lasting Path to EPS Expansion

### The Fundamental Principle

"Earnings per share will not grow merely because sales increase" - sales appears in both numerator and denominator, canceling out.

### The Four Growth Levers (and Their Limits)

```
Asset Turnover × Return on Sales × Leverage × Book Value Per Share = EPS
```

1. **Asset turnover** - Limited by productive capacity
2. **Return on sales** - Limited by competition (fat margins invite new entrants)
3. **Leverage** - Limited by lender willingness
4. **Book value per share** - Can rise continuously through retained earnings (the only sustainable source)

### The Sustainable Growth Formula

```
Sustainable Growth Rate = (Return on Equity) × (Income Reinvestment Rate)

Where: Income Reinvestment Rate = 1 - Dividend Payout Ratio
```

**Example**: Company with 15% ROE and 40% dividend payout:
```
Sustainable Growth = 0.15 × (1 - 0.40) = 9%
```

**Investment test**: Company claiming 12% long-term growth with these fundamentals must improve ROE, cut dividends, or issue equity—none may be realistic.

### Stock Buybacks: When They Matter

**Valid uses**:
- Prevent dilution from stock options
- Return capital when no good reinvestment opportunities
- More tax-efficient than dividends

**Red flag**: "Short-run fix for a sagging share price, particularly if the repurchase seems timed to boost executive compensation"

**The IBM warning**: 1995-1999 spent $34.1B on buybacks exceeding $31.3B net income, increasing leverage and financial risk. "Lenders refuse at some point to countenance increased indebtedness."

**Critical nuance**: "To the extent that the company funds buybacks with idle cash, the increase in EPS is reduced by the amount of income formerly earned by parking the cash in short-term debt instruments. If a company has far more cash than it can employ profitably, management cannot truly be accused of artificially inflating per share income."

## The Du Pont Formula: Diagnosing ROE Quality

Reveals whether returns come from operational excellence, efficient asset use, or financial leverage.

### The Formula

```
Return on Equity = Asset Turnover × Return on Sales × Financial Leverage
```

Or:
```
(Sales/Assets) × (Income/Sales) × (Assets/Equity) = Income/Equity
```

### How to Apply

**Step 1**: Calculate three components
**Step 2**: Compare to peers and historical levels
**Step 3**: Identify ROE sources:
- High ROE from turnover/margins → sustainable operational excellence
- High ROE primarily from leverage → risky, vulnerable to deleveraging

### What It Reveals

**Good improvement**: "Reduce working capital without impairing competitiveness (thereby improving asset turnover)."

**Bad improvement**: "Cutting back on necessary capital expenditures...will also have a positive effect—in the short run. Not only will the denominator decline...but also return on sales will rise as future depreciation charges are reduced. Underspending will eventually hurt competitiveness."

### Real Example: Campbell vs. Pilgrim's Pride

Similar ROEs (19.13% vs. 18.05%) from very different sources:

**Campbell Soup**:
- Asset turnover: 0.62×
- Return on sales: 2.60%
- Return on assets: 1.60%
- **Financial leverage: 11.92×**

**Pilgrim's Pride**:
- Asset turnover: 1.61×
- Return on sales: 4.00%
- Return on assets: 6.42%
- Financial leverage: 2.81×

**Investment insight**: Campbell's ROE "is purely a consequence of using more than four times as much leverage." True operational performance (ROA) is just 1.60% vs. Pilgrim's 6.42%. If Campbell deleverages, ROE collapses.

### The GAAP Distortion: Hershey's 66% ROE

Hershey's extraordinary 66% ROE "results from the company's very low book value" because "under GAAP, the costs of product development and advertising, which create enduring value just as a factory does, are expensed rather than capitalized."

**Evidence**: Hershey's book value is just 5.6% of market value (18× market-to-book).

**Broader application**: "The R&D outlays of technology and pharmaceutical companies are written off as incurred and consequently are assigned no asset value under GAAP." For these companies, ROE becomes nearly meaningless.

## The Intangibles Problem and Modern Solutions

### Why Book Value Became Irrelevant

Research by Lev and Srivastava showed declining success of traditional value investing (low market-to-book stocks) as "corporate investment in intangibles such as R&D, information technology, brand development, and human resources" grew. "Under GAAP, these investments are expensed, rather than capitalized."

**The shift**: By 2020, "investment in intangibles were running twice the level of investment in tangibles." Book values became "widely understated."

**The value trap**: "Value investors who clung to stock selection criteria of earlier times avoided the shares of many companies that were doing an excellent job of creating bonafide economic value."

### The Solution: Focus on Return on Invested Capital

```
ROIC = [Net Income + Net Interest Paid × (1 - Tc)] / Invested Capital

Where:
Tc = Cash tax rate = Current Tax Expense / Net Income Before Taxes
Invested Capital = Equity + Long-Term Debt + Short-Term Debt - Excess Cash
```

The numerator is Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT).

**Advantages**:
- "Measures return earned by all providers of capital"
- "Unaffected by use of leverage" (allows apples-to-apples comparison)
- Better reflects true economic returns

**Limitation**: "Influenced by the age of the company's assets. A company can boost its ROIC just by spending too little to keep its plant and equipment up to date."

**When to use**: Comparing companies with different capital structures, evaluating capital allocation quality, assessing true operational performance independent of financing choices.

### Investment Application for Intangible-Heavy Companies

When evaluating modern businesses (technology, pharmaceuticals, consumer brands):
1. Recognize book value severely understates economic value
2. Mentally adjust for R&D, brand building, IT investments when comparing market-to-book ratios
3. Focus on ROIC or cash returns rather than ROE
4. Don't avoid high market-to-book stocks if justified by genuine intangible value creation

## EBITDA as Alternative Valuation: Understanding Takeover Potential

Beyond P/E multiples, some investors value companies on EBITDA multiples—a cash flow approach that reveals restructuring potential.

**Why it matters**: Companies trading at low EBITDA multiples (8-9×) may attract takeover interest even if P/E multiples seem fair. Understanding this creates awareness of potential takeover premiums as upside catalyst.

**Typical EBITDA multiples**: Large transactions in 2020 averaged around 11× EBITDA.

**Investment application**: Look for companies with:
- Low EBITDA multiples relative to peers
- Conservative balance sheets (unused debt capacity)
- Operational inefficiencies new management could improve
- Valuable assets buried in consolidated financials

These characteristics create restructuring potential that may unlock value.

## Detection Methods

### False Profit Improvements from Investment Cuts

Companies can "report an immediate improvement in earnings by cutting back expenditures on advertising and research and development. Even though the accounting rules do not permit these outlays to be capitalized, they create benefits in future periods. Sharply reducing such expenditures, or delaying essential capital projects to conserve cash, can impair a company's future competitiveness, rendering the increase in current-period earnings illusory."

**How to detect**:
- Track R&D and marketing as % of sales over time
- Compare capex to depreciation (capex < depreciation signals underinvestment)
- Query industry sources about service quality
- Monitor customer satisfaction reports

**Warning sign**: If customers "report a drop in the quality of service...it may indicate that important sales support functions have been eviscerated. Earnings may rise in the short run but soon begin to suffer as customers switch."

### Cyclical Stability Claims

**Common claims**:
- Automotive parts maker emphasizing replacement parts
- Building materials firm emphasizing remodeling/repair

**How to verify**:
1. Check historical revenue/earnings through full business cycles
2. Verify countercyclical segment is >30% of revenue
3. Confirm past cycles actually showed stability

### Adjusted Earnings Games

**Defense mechanism**: Apply lower P/E multiples when:
- Adjusted earnings differ materially from GAAP
- Company frequently adjusts for "one-time" items that recur
- Adjustments exclude genuine operating costs (stock compensation)
- Management emphasizes adjusted earnings while burying GAAP numbers

**Final principle**: "Financial statement analysis provides an invaluable reference point for valuation...Eventually, rationality usually reasserts itself. The share price then returns to a level that is justifiable on the basis of the company's long-range capacity to generate earnings and cash."
