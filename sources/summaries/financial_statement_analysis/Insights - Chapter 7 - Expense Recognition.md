# Chapter 7: Expense Recognition

## OBJECTIVE

Corporate managers are just as creative in minimizing and slowing expense recognition as they are in maximizing and speeding revenue recognition. Companies manipulate expenses through liberal capitalization assumptions, unjustified accruals, timing relocations, and premature rebate booking. **These gambits are exceedingly difficult to detect in public financial statements, but seemingly minor yet unprecedented or unconventional entries can foreshadow major restatements.** Analysts must be disciplined enough to disbelieve the innocent explanations companies routinely provide for abnormalities pointing to trouble.

## The Mirror Image Principle

Just as Chapter 6 showed companies grossly distorting earnings through aggressive revenue recognition, the answer to whether companies also pump up profits by manipulating expenses is "resoundingly affirmative." The techniques are equally varied: liberal assumptions about costs that may be capitalized, unjustified accruals, dilution with one-time gains, time relocation, and premature rebate booking.

## Time-Shifting: Moving Expenses Between Periods

**The mechanism**: Company books payments in wrong fiscal periods to shift costs forward, overstating earlier profits and boosting stock price when needed for strategic purposes.

**Diamond Foods** announced restatement involving $20M (August 2010) and $60M (September 2011) in payments to walnut growers booked in wrong periods. The timing artificially inflated earnings just as company was using its stock to acquire Pringles for $2.35B from Procter & Gamble. After restatement announcement, shares fell 44% in after-hours trading, P&G pulled the deal, and Pringles went to Kellogg instead.

### Detecting Time-Shifting: The Industry Data Cross-Check

**Wall Street Journal** analyst John Jannarone warned five months before restatement by applying publicly available agricultural data:

**The calculation**:
- Conservatively assumed Diamond bought 20% of 2010 California walnut crop (had disclosed 40% in 2005)
- USDA reported 2010 crop at 1 billion pounds
- Growers reported average $0.25/pound momentum payment
- **Estimated payment: $50M—more than half of $93M operating income**
- Actual later admitted: ~$60M recorded in wrong period

**Additional context signals**:
- Even with 2011 payment, growers received <$1.00/pound from Diamond
- USDA reported average $1.06/pound for 2010 California crop
- Growers could get better prices in export markets (China, Turkey) once contracts expired
- Walnuts represented 30% of Diamond's sales = major business risk

**Market reaction to analysis**: Stock fell 8.5% day of *Barron's* article (S&P 500 up 1.0%).

**The lesson**: When company's reported costs seem misaligned with industry pricing data, calculate what proper accounting would yield. Industry sources and government statistics often provide enough data for rough verification.

**Critical timing indicator**: Restatement came *after* Sarbanes-Oxley, showing analysts cannot let guard down just because CEOs face greater prison risk for falsifying statements.

## Cookie-Jar Reserves and Big Bath Accounting

**The strategy**: Overstate losses during money-losing periods, creating reserves that can be taken into profits in later years. Premised on belief that magnifying annual loss won't hurt stock price as much as magnifying profit will help it in subsequent year.

**The bonus structure incentive**: Current bonuses not reduced from zero if reported loss is pumped up through unjustified accruals, but future bonuses increased if those accruals taken into profits later in profitable year. Particularly powerful when bonuses tied to "returning to profitability."

### Nortel: The Embedded Culture of "Hardness"

Nortel followed time-honored strategy of taking big bath in 2001-2002 money-losing period. Overstating losses created cookie-jar reserves taken into later years' profits.

**Initial announcement** (October 2003): Announced "mistakes" requiring reduction of previously stated losses totaling $740M for 2000-2003. Balance sheet overstated liabilities by $900M (partly offset by $160M tax benefits), plus $92M revenues should have been deferred. **Investors' naive reaction**: Because restatement lowered losses, news wasn't that bad. Stock fell only 6% in after-hours trading.

**The escalation** (March-April 2004):
- Audit committee investigation necessitated another revision
- Delayed filing 2003 financials (classic red flag)
- Placed CFO and Controller on indefinite paid leave (suggests acute problems, possible auditor disagreement)
- Dropped bombshell: 50% cut in previously announced 2003 earnings of $732M
- Fired CEO, CFO, and Controller for cause

**The accruals abuse**: Executives used term **"hardness"** to describe state of having ample reserves to draw on later for earnings management. Internal document showed quarterly earnings targets alongside "balance sheet" number that kept changing—suggesting management generated earnings increases by drawing on reserves.

**Internal vs. external numbers**: Q1 2003 publicly reported net income of $54M, but internal "pro forma income" included ~$361M in reserves, of which ~$160M was inappropriately reversed. This internal figure, used for bonus calculations, created powerful incentives to raid the cookie jar. Once four quarters of cumulative profits were recorded, triggered bonuses of 10-25% of salary for most employees and 2-4× salary for top managers.

**The seemingly small items principle**: Investors paid little attention to few hundred million dollars of reserve-related losses in context of $34B total losses 2000-2004. But those additions created accrued liabilities that grew to $5B by summer 2002, giving management vast opportunity to manipulate earnings for bonuses.

**Ultimate outcome**: Company filed bankruptcy January 2009 (U.S., Canada, UK), liquidated all assets by June 2009.

## Rebate Manipulation and Corporate Culture Deterioration

**The proper treatment**: Rebates involving not only current business but upfront inducements for multi-year orders should be taken into earnings over time, not booked immediately.

### General Motors: Blue Chip Culture Shifts with Profitability

GM's experience illustrates critical principle: **Long-established company with strong balance sheet and stable earnings may have culture of going by the book on accounting—but that culture can change if profitability erodes.**

**GM's trajectory**:
- First rated 1953: Achieved top AAA ranking
- Pre-1933: Provided audited financials before mandatory
- 1981: AAA ratings gone, attitude toward reporting began shifting
- 1982: Liberalized policies, became regular proponent of looser standards at FASB hearings
- 2005: Bond ratings slid to speculative grade (BB)

**The restatement** (November 2005): Announced need to restate 2001 income, cutting it by $300-400M—hefty chunk of already-depressed $601M profit (down from $4.45B in 2000). Issue: "erroneously" booked supplier credits immediately rather than amortizing over multi-year period. CFO had previously stated "very clear" policy of taking no supplier rebates; spokeswoman later backtracked: "some years ago we did say we would generally discontinue... generally we have... not sure if stopped completely."

**Pattern of issues signaling systemic problems**:
- Booked $27M gain on precious metals sale despite repurchase agreement next year (should have been financing, not sale—fundamental accounting principle, not honest mistake)
- Misclassified mortgage subsidiary cash flows (unambiguous rules—extending loan/receiving repayment = investing, not operating)
- Failed to write down Fuji Heavy Industries investment timely, citing ineffective controls at "reasonable assurance level"
- Delayed 10-K filing (classic warning sign)
- Abrupt CFO change (December 2005)

**Detection principle**: When blue chip shows pattern of accounting issues across multiple areas simultaneously, mounting evidence strongly suggests corporate culture deteriorating as ability to generate bona fide profits wanes. These weren't isolated mistakes but symptomatic of widespread aggressiveness.

**The outcome**: Filed bankruptcy June 1, 2009. Stock plummeted from $19.42 (year-end 2005) to $0.75.

## The Snowballing Dynamic: When Manipulation Escalates

**The principle**: Initial manipulation to smooth earnings requires bigger subsequent manipulations to maintain illusion, creating exponential growth in deception that eventually collapses.

**Freddie Mac** time-shifted $420M of pro forma profits through economically meaningless derivatives transactions. When falling interest rates created "earnings blizzard" in 2001, company initiated strategy to avoid reporting unwanted spike. But rates continued falling rather than leveling off. To keep game going, management had to undertake bigger and bigger transactions. **Final transaction shifted more income than first eight combined.**

**The market reaction paradox**: Stock fell when company announced *upward* revision of previous years' earnings (January 21-23, 2003: Freddie shares fell nearly 5% while S&P 500 unchanged). **Explanation**: Investors concerned about reliability of financial statements, not direction of restatement. Outside investigators later labeled practices "results-oriented, reverse engineered, and opportunistic."

**The ironic twist**: After all maneuvers stripped away, net effect was company *overstated* 2001 earnings by almost $1B.

**Critical lesson**: Never dismiss restatements that appear to "help" the company. If company uses accruals to understate profits, will have no compunction about overstating them later through aggressive revenue recognition. Manipulation tends to escalate, not resolve naturally.

## Detection Framework: Warning Sign Clusters

Rather than viewing issues in isolation, watch for clustering of multiple signals indicating systemic problems:

**Management behavior patterns**:
- Placement of executives on "indefinite paid leave" rather than immediate firing (suggests acute problems, possible auditor disagreement)
- Senior management changes, especially CFO departures
- Delayed financial statement filings
- Bonuses tied to specific profitability thresholds creating manipulation incentive

**Financial statement anomalies**:
- Reserves growing disproportionately to business size
- "Seemingly small" reserve additions that accumulate to material amounts
- Misclassification of items that appears to violate unambiguous rules
- Transactions with no economic substance
- Rebate/credit booking that contradicts previous policy statements
- Management backtracking on previously "clear" policies with vague explanations ("generally we have...")

**Corporate culture indicators**:
- Long-established company experiencing profitability erosion
- Shift from conservative to aggressive accounting advocacy at standard-setting bodies
- Embedded jargon indicating earnings management ("hardness")
- Internal metrics differing substantially from publicly reported figures

**Third-party data misalignments**:
- Company costs misaligned with industry pricing
- Government statistics contradicting reported economics
- Peer companies showing different treatment of similar items

## Investment Application: The Disciplined Skeptic's Approach

**1. Calculate what proper accounting would yield**:
- Use industry statistics (government agriculture data, pricing surveys)
- Cross-reference with peer company treatment
- Don't accept management's "generally we have" explanations for policy violations

**2. Watch for the seemingly small**:
- Small reserve additions can accumulate to massive manipulation opportunity
- Hundreds of millions may seem immaterial against tens of billions in losses
- But those reserves create vast cookie jar for future earnings smoothing

**3. Track corporate culture deterioration**:
- Has historically conservative company begun advocating for looser standards?
- Has profitability erosion coincided with accounting policy liberalization?
- Are credit ratings declining alongside accounting issues?

**4. Apply the accumulation test**:
- Single accounting issue may have innocent explanation
- Multiple issues across different areas simultaneously = systemic problem
- Pattern of "mistakes" plus management explanations that don't hold up = red flag

**5. Recognize the snowballing pattern**:
- Manipulation tends to escalate, not resolve naturally
- Each period requires bigger manipulations to maintain illusion
- Watch for transactions that grow exponentially in size

**6. Never dismiss restatements that "help" the company**:
- Freddie Mac's upward revision of prior earnings crashed stock price
- Nortel's reduction of losses was naively viewed as "not that bad"—but was beginning of situation that kept getting worse
- If company manipulates in one direction, will manipulate in other direction when circumstances change

**Above all**: Be disciplined enough to disbelieve innocent explanations companies routinely provide. When blue chips show pattern of accounting liberalization coinciding with profitability challenges, treat as evidence of cultural deterioration rather than isolated mistakes. The mounting evidence across multiple accounting areas is more reliable signal than any single management representation.
