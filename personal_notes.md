**Peter's Digest:**
- did we implement vector search for ai news? Or just boolean? (check ai_news script)
- can we add prominent section headers for each source? and clear breaks between section? Review the format of the last 2 daily digests for context. This is a nice to have, not a need to have; only implement if it doesn't take a lot of work.
- for some reason, the date is correct sometimes, and sometimes it isn't. for example, it will call 2-13 digest 2-14. an idea why?

**Screening:**
- review SCREENING_PROCESS.md to understand the updates we are making. The price section is already completed, although you can verify if you'd like.
- for earnings, we have three main questions that i'd like to answer: 1) What is the earnings trend and volatility (both recent and over the past 5 years); 2) How does the recent EPS compare to the consensus estimated EPS for the next quarter (i.e., what is the delta between what they have done in the past and what they are expected to do)? 3) What is the P/E ratio, trend, and correlation between price and earnings? I don't think the 'metrics' in the screening_process.md file properly capture these questions, and we can use them as inputs but do not have to follow them; I much prefer how we have handled the price analysis over these rigid 'metrics'. 
- for both price and earnings in the previous drafts of the scripts and data, we were capturing both recent (past 12 months, past 4 quarters) and long-term trends (past 5 years). for price, we have not included the recent trend in the same way, but are claculating deltas vs. multiple time periods, which may provide the same insights as looking at the monthly/quarterly closes over the past 12 months; thoughts? for earnings, capturing data over the past 4 quarters may still be helpful, or we can figure out a similar set of comparisons as we have done with price to cpature the insights without the quarterly data. you can review the Daily_Screening_2026-02-11.txt to see what I am referring to if you'd like.
- this question is simple but has big implications: What is the P/E ratio and correlation between price and earnings? We can discuss what to include for trend; quarterly and annual figures may be relevant again here. the implications of the p/e ratio, as well as its trend, are clear. but this correlation is very interesting as well becuase it shows us if the price and earnings as corrleated or detached; if they are detached, there may be an opportunity for sentiment arbitrage (earnings are trending up, but price is flat/down); if they are corrleated, it can still be a positive signal, or confirmaiton of why the price is dropping (both price and eanrings on a downtrend). perhaps this is good context for the llm during analysis and belongs in the prompt, but I wanted you to also be aware of the context.
- How shoudl we incorporate the P/E (which is just the tabluation of the price and eanrings, not a separate API call); include it in the earnings script? Will the script then look at the already fetched price data to arrive at P/E? What trends/comparisons do we want to make for P/E? In my opinion, some standardization across price, earnings, and P/E would be beneficial for comparisons where applicable. For example, we should probably have P/E time period comparisons match earnings, which should match price where possible (eanrings is limited to quarterly data so we can't match price exactly, but we can try to be consistent where possible). I am a bit concerned that if we have different time periods for price and earnings, we run the risk of confusing the system. the price analysis is its own step and can be detached from the earnings step, but we do need them both to be on the same page for P/E.
