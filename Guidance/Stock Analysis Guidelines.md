# Stock Analysis Guidelines

Core principles and their applications. Supplemented by detailed insights in the [Insights Index](Insights%20Index.md).

## How to Use This System

When analyzing or answering questions, consult sources in this order:

1. **Investment Analysis Guidelines** (this document) — Core principles and application criteria
2. **Insights Index** → **Insight Files** — Detailed frameworks, concepts, and source quotes
3. **Raw Material** — Original source text when maximum context is needed

Move down the hierarchy only when the higher level doesn't provide sufficient depth.

## Part I: Core Principles

### Ground All Interpretations
Only answer when you have data. If data doesn't exist, say so explicitly—never fill gaps with estimates or assumptions. Ground all interpretations in glossaries or explicitly stated general financial knowledge—never fabricate explanations.

### GAAP vs. Economic Reality
GAAP profits ≠ bona fide profits—true profit means owners are wealthier afterward. GAAP systematically understates value for intangible-heavy businesses (R&D, IT, brands) by expensing rather than capitalizing. Book value has fallen from 95% (1978) to ~10% (modern FAANG) of market value. Non-GAAP adjustments often exceed GAAP income by 2x. Remember: the purpose of financial reporting is often to obtain cheap capital, not to present economic reality. Focus on cash generation and economic substance over accounting presentation.

### Investment vs. Speculation
Investment requires both: (1) thorough analysis of value, and (2) safety of principal. Operations failing either test are speculative. True investment occupies middle ground between two speculative extremes:

- Low-quality at low prices (speculative due to doubtful quality)
- High-quality at high prices (speculative due to excessive valuation)

At sufficiently low prices, even troubled businesses can become safe investments—downside is limited by substantial discount to value.

### Margin of Safety

**Intrinsic Value**: Value justified by assets, earnings, and definite prospects (approximates present value of future cash flows). Precision is unnecessary—establish whether value is adequate, considerably higher, or lower than price. A range suffices, widening with business uncertainty. Historical performance establishes credibility—consistent returns suggest continuation and provide confidence for buying temporary discounts.

**Price vs. Value**: Buy at bargain prices relative to intrinsic value. This margin protects against analytical errors, business deterioration, and adverse conditions. Require returns exceeding market alternatives (e.g., 15% when market offers high-single-digits)—this gap absorbs mistakes and shortfalls.

### Market Pricing
Prices reflect sentiment, not mathematical risk: public attitude → bids/offers → price. Sentiment-driven pricing creates opportunities when popularity diverges from value. Returns aren't inherent to asset classes—they result from fundamentals and prices paid.

### Analysis Limitations
Analysis works best for stable businesses, not those with wide variations. Valuing future growth is hazardous—"little of definite value can be said" about determining prospects. Limit analysis depth to match investment importance; accept information gaps when additional data requires disproportionate effort.

### Opportunity Sources
Mispricings concentrate in out-of-favor situations: litigation, scandal, distress, disappointment, management upheaval, downgrades. Best opportunities combine high-quality businesses with large but solvable one-time problems—quality limits downside, pessimism creates bargain prices. Distinguish temporary problems (depress prices) from permanent impairments (justify low valuations).

### The Two Hazards of Forecasting
(1) Forecast may be wrong. (2) Even if correct, may already be priced in. Current market price already reflects consensus future prospects—accurate forecasts provide no edge if market already discounts them.

### EPS Growth Drivers
Sales appears in both numerator and denominator—cancels out. Sustainable growth comes only from: (1) improving returns on sales, (2) improving asset turnover, (3) increasing leverage (limited), or (4) retaining earnings (only unlimited source).

### All Theses Are Flawed
That a thesis is flawed does not mean we should not invest—as long as other people believe in it and there is a large group left to be convinced. The edge is in looking for the flaws: if we find them, we can limit losses when the market discovers what we already know. Recognizing flaws that are likely to appear when a hypothesis becomes reality puts you ahead of the game. It is when we are unaware of what could go wrong that we have to worry.

## Part II: Stock-Level Application

### Mispricing Candidates
The best opportunities combine a high-quality business with a large but solvable one-time problem. Quality limits downside while pessimism creates bargain prices. The critical distinction: temporary problems (depress prices) vs. permanent impairments (justify low valuations).

### Brand Name Dynamics
Brand name stocks deserve special attention. Because market participants are more likely to hear news about popular companies, these stocks benefit from good news quickly and recover faster than secondary stocks—making them better mispricing candidates when quality remains intact.

### Glamour Metrics Trap
Be skeptical of "glamour" metrics driving price increases. Revenue growth gets headlines, but sales growth alone does not grow EPS. A stock rising on top-line growth that doesn't translate to earnings improvement is a mispricing candidate when sentiment corrects.

### Reflexivity at Stock Level
A prevailing bias can validate itself by altering a company's operational reality—lowering its cost of capital or inflating the value of its collateral. What appears to be improving "fundamentals" may be an artifact of market sentiment rather than genuine business improvement.

Two necessary conditions for a reflexive boom/bust at the stock level:
1. Stock prices must be capable of affecting fundamentals (through acquisitions, financing, incentives)
2. There must be a flaw in perception that allows the bias to emerge

> **Related**: Alchemy Chapter 1 (Two Necessary Conditions, Conglomerate Boom case study)

### Financial Statement Red Flags
When evaluating individual stocks, watch for:

**Revenue manipulation signals**: Channel stuffing, bill-and-hold arrangements, round-tripping, percentage-of-completion abuse. Cross-check reported trends against industry data.

**Expense manipulation signals**: Aggressive capitalization, cookie-jar reserves, big bath accounting. When one manipulation is found, assume others exist—companies rarely limit themselves to a single trick.

**The snowballing dynamic**: Once manipulation begins, it requires ever-larger manipulations to maintain the illusion. Look for accelerating divergence between reported earnings and cash flow.

**Corporate culture deterioration**: Profitability decline often precedes accounting aggression. Management facing pressure to meet expectations may shift from conservative to aggressive recognition.

## Part III: Market-Level Application

### Boom/Bust Anatomy
Watch for reflexive feedback loops where inflated stock prices accelerate an underlying trend, which enhances expectations and inflates prices further—until outcomes fail to sustain expectations.

A misconception is always involved:
- Conglomerate boom: investors valued per-share earnings identically regardless of how achieved
- Technology boom: stocks valued at multiples of revenue rather than earnings; growth financed by selling stock rather than sound business plans

In each case the misconception was reinforced by genuinely improving fundamentals—this is the **fertile fallacy**, where participants fail to recognize that the fundamentals they are cheering only look healthy because the market is currently willing to fund them.

Eventually a turning point is reached, and once stocks decline the trend becomes self-reinforcing in the opposite direction: excesses concealed while prices were rising begin to surface, and the same mechanism that created the rise ensures an abrupt, asymmetric collapse.

Reflexivity may or may not give rise to a full boom/bust sequence, and the process may be aborted at any time—not everything is a five-alarm fire.

### Macro Indicators to Monitor
- **Gold/Commodities**: Increased allocation signals
- **Treasury Yields**: Changes and trends in yields and bond prices
- **Economic Indicators**: Significant changes in inflation, consumer sentiment, unemployment

### Cautionary Posture
When the market is overly optimistic, be more selective. Cheap stocks can still be found, but raise the bar and avoid being too aggressive when prices are elevated.
