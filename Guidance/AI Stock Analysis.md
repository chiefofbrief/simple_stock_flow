# AI Investment Guidance

## 1. The Strategy: Riding the Reflexive Wave
AI is currently in a **reflexive boom**. High stock prices lower the cost of capital for Big Tech, enabling record-breaking CapEx (projecting $500B+ total in 2026). We will participate by favoring "Suppliers" with structural moats until the news reflects a breakdown in the circular revenue loop.

* **The Circular Loop:** Hyperscalers fund AI Labs/Startups → Startups spend that capital on Hyperscaler cloud credits and chips → Revenues grow, justifying more CapEx.
* **The Big Tech Subsidy:** Hyperscalers are absorbing enormous demand risk across the supply chain, creating a subsidy for the entire ecosystem.
* **The Revenue Imperative:** The application layer must eventually generate ~$600B in revenue to justify the current infrastructure buildout.

## 2. The AI Ecosystem Framework
Group today's news into these four categories for synthesis and reporting.

### I. Compute & Chips (Layers 1-2)
* **Foundry Leverage:** TSMC (TSM) is the dominant foundry with a systematic underbuilding strategy to maintain pricing power.
* **Semiconductor Moats:** NVIDIA (NVDA) dominates but faces "customer defection risk" as hyperscalers develop Custom Silicon (TPUs, Trainium, Graviton).
* **Depreciation Risk:** New chip cycles (e.g., Blackwell B100) offer massive performance gains (2.5x), rapidly devaluing older hardware (H100).
* **Key Tickers:** TSM, NVDA, AMD, AVGO, ASML, AMAT, LRCX, KLAC, MU, SSNLF.

### II. Infrastructure & Power (Layer 3)
* **Demand Shock:** Data center REITs are experiencing a "demand shock" with guaranteed 15–20 year leases.
* **Physical Bottlenecks:** After the 2024 "land grab," 2025-2026 are **Execution Years**. Power and cooling are the primary constraints to growth.
* **Key Tickers:** MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, META, DLR, EQIX, VRT, ETN, JCI, SBGSY.

### III. Models & Tools (Layers 4-7)
* **Consolidation:** The "Big 5" Finalists (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, xAI).
* **Switching Costs:** Low for model providers; much higher for **Orchestration/Agent frameworks** and **Data Services**.
* **Key Tickers:** PLTR, SNOW, MDB, DDOG, CRWD, PANW, IBM, ORCL.

### IV. Applications (Layer 8)
* **The Revenue Test:** Applications must generate revenue to support all underlying layers.
* **The Opportunity:** Application developers benefit most from the "Subsidy Effect" as compute prices decline.
* **Key Tickers:** CRM, ADBE, NOW, WDAY, INTU, TSLA (Robotics/FSD).

## 3. The Exit Signal
Monitor the news for a breakdown in the "Reflexive Loop."
* **Indicator 1:** Hyperscalers cut CapEx or shift focus from "Execution" back to "Discovery."
* **Indicator 2:** A "Turning Point" where excesses concealed during the rise (e.g., unpaid cloud credits, startup failures) begin to surface.
* **Indicator 3:** The $600B revenue gap is acknowledged by the market as insurmountable.
