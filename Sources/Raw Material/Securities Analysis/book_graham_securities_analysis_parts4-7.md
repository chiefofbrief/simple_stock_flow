Introduction to Part IV
GO WITH THE FLOW
BY BRUCE BERKOWITZ
I
n the urban, melting-pot neighborhood where I grew up, one of the
most popular retail establishments was the corner variety store. Area
residents frequented the place for small, everyday needs—a newspa-
per or magazine or a quart of milk. We kids showed up constantly with
what change we had cajoled from family members or earned by running
errands, eager to spend it on candy bars, chewing gum, and soft drinks.
The owner had one cash register, seated on a countertop near the
front door. Into it went the cash from customers’ purchases. The propri-
etor took out what he needed to stock the shelves, pay the rent, maintain
the store, and meet his small payroll. If there was anything left after that,
the proprietor had the choice of using the remaining cash to invest in the
business’s growth, pay down debts, or meet personal living expenses.
Years later, after I had started working in the investment business, I
began reading the annual reports written by Berkshire Hathaway chair-
man Warren Buffett, which led me to the works of Benjamin Graham and
David Dodd. I soon realized that the financial operations of this simple
variety store represented a good example of free cash flow. Graham and
Dodd referred to that excess cash as “earnings power” or “owner earn-
ings. ” That’s the amount of cash an owner can pocket after paying all
expenses and making whatever investments are necessary to maintain
the business. This free cash flow is the well from which all returns are
drawn, whether they are dividends, stock buybacks, or investments capa-
ble of enhancing future returns.

Graham and Dodd were among the first to apply careful financial
analysis to common stocks. Until then, most serious investment analysis
had focused on fixed income securities. Graham and Dodd argued that
stocks, like bonds, have a well-defined value based on a stream of future
returns. With bonds, the returns consist of specific payments made under
contractual commitments. With stocks, the returns consist of dividends
that are paid from the earnings of the business, or cash that could have
been used to pay dividends that was instead reinvested in the business.
By examining the assets of a business and their earnings (or cash
flow) power, Graham and Dodd argued that the value of future returns
could be calculated with reasonable accuracy. Once determined, this
value helps you decide whether to purchase a particular stock. A calcu-
lated value of $20 for a stock trading at $10 per share would allow for a
profit even if your estimate was off by a few dollars. But if you estimated
a $12 value for a stock trading at $10 per share, it would fail to make the
buy list; even though the stock was somewhat undervalued, there would
not be a sufficient margin for error.
Sharpen Your Pencil
The fundamental problem of equity investing is how to value a company. In
the 1930s, that was done by measuring tangible assets. The reason: much
of the stock market’s capitalization in that era was based on raw materials
(mainly mining companies), transportation (railroads), utilities, and manu-
facturing. All of those industries had significant amounts of plant, equip-
ment, and inventory. Today, service firms dominate the economy, and,
even in manufacturing, much of a firm’s capital comes from intangibles—
software, acquired brands, customers, product portfolios—that do not
appear explicitly on the balance sheet. For example, relatively little of the
value of software companies like Oracle and Microsoft or a business ser-
vices firm like Automated Data Processing is captured by tangible assets.
[340] Introduction to Part IV

**[Page 393]**

To value equities, we at Fairholme begin by calculating free cash flow.
We start with net income as defined under Generally Accepted Account-
ing Principles (GAAP). Then we add back noncash charges such as depre-
ciation and amortization, which are formulaic calculations based on
historical costs (depreciation for tangible assets, amortization for intangi-
bles) and may not reflect a reduction in those assets’ true worth.
Even so, most assets deteriorate in value over time, and we have to
account for that. So we subtract an estimate of the company’s cost of
maintaining tangible assets such as the office, plant, inventory, and
equipment; and intangible assets like customer traffic and brand identity.
Investment at this level, properly deployed, should keep the profits of the
business in a steady state.
That is only the beginning. For instance, companies often misstate the
costs of employees’ pension and postretirement medical benefits. They
also overestimate their benefit plans’ future investment returns or under-
estimate future medical costs, so in a free cash flow analysis, you need to
adjust the numbers to reflect those biases.
Companies often lowball what they pay management. For instance,
until the last several years, most companies did not count the costs of
stock option grants as employee compensation, nor did the costs show
up in any other line item. Some went so far as to try to mask this options
expense by repurchasing large quantities of shares in the open market to
offset the stock options exercised by employees. The problem: compa-
nies were often paying much more on the open market than they
received from employees exercising options granted years before. This
difference was rarely reported as an official cost of doing business.
Another source of accounting-derived profits comes from long-term
supply contracts. For instance, when now-defunct Enron entered into a
long-term trading or supply arrangement, the company very optimisti-
cally estimated the net present value of future profits from the deal and
Bruce Berkowitz [341]

**[Page 394]**

put that into the current year’s earnings even though no cash was
received. Enron is gone, but not the practice. Insurance companies and
banks still have considerable leeway in how they estimate the future
losses arising from insured events or loan defaults. And for any company,
gains and losses on derivative contracts are difficult to nail down with
precision since the markets for such instruments are thin.
Some companies understate free cash flow because they expense the
cost of what are really investments in their growth. For instance, adding
new auto insurance customers may cost as much as 20% to 30% more
than the cash received from new policyholders in their first year. Some of
this excess cost goes to replace customers who did not renew their poli-
cies. But if the number of policyholders is growing, a portion of the
expense represents investment in growth. Berkshire Hathaway’s GEICO
subsidiary does just this, and as a result, accounting earnings understate
free cash flow assuming a steady-state business. When Microsoft sells a
Windows program, the company recognizes that future servicing costs
are part of that sale. Microsoft accounts for these costs by spreading the
revenues and expenses over a number of years. The result is to defer
profits to future periods and provide the company with a cushion against
future adverse developments.
All of these noncash accounting conventions illustrate the difficulty of
identifying a company’s current free cash flow. Still, we are far from done.
My associates and I next want to know (a) how representative is current
cash flow of average past flow, and (b) is it increasing or decreasing—
that is, does the company face headwinds or ride on tailwinds?
Cash Flow Where You Least Expect It
Certainly one company facing stiff headwinds in 2008 was Mohawk
Industries, a carpeting and flooring firm we first purchased in 2006 at
prices in the low $60s. At the time, the company reported GAAP earnings
[342] Introduction to Part IV

---
**[Page 395]**

of $6.70 per share, but our analysis showed free cash flow of $9 per share.
Why was free cash flow so much greater than earnings? First, Mohawk
had been growing by acquiring some of the smaller players as part of an
industrywide consolidation, so it gained economies of scale that allowed
the company to reduce capital spending and lower its working capital
needs. Even more important, the use of GAAP required Mohawk to take
significant charges against its earnings to amortize the intangible assets
it had picked up in its buying spree. (The difference between what a
company pays for an acquisition and the acquired company’s book value
goes on the balance sheet as an intangible asset called “goodwill. ”) These
charges reduced net income but did not take any cash out of the busi-
ness. All told, we calculated that Mohawk was selling at less than seven
times its free cash flow, an attractive valuation. It was akin to buying a
bond yielding 14%, with a decent chanc e that the coupon payments
would rise over time.
In 2008, in the midst of a seriously depressed new housing market
(most carpeting and flooring go into new construction), Mohawk Indus-
tries was still generating $6 to $7 a share of free cash flow. The stock at
$75 a share was trading at around 11 to 12 times free cash flow, still an
attractive multiple for a company in a cyclical downswing. True, revenues
were slumping, but industry consolidation had largely eliminated once-
rampant price-cutting competition among manufacturers. In fact, manu-
facturers were able to pass along increased raw materials costs to
customers. That has helped to preserve profit margins and cash flow.
While the carpeting and flooring industry will continue to fluctuate with
the economy, Mohawk’s management has been able to keep its free cash
flow generation fairly steady.
Not surprisingly, investors who search for companies with good free
cash flow often find them in mature industries, such as the flooring busi-
ness. Capital required for growth is limited and financing demands are

modest, so free cash is plentiful. That’s not usually the case with high-
growth companies, but sometimes meticulous analysis will uncover one,
such as EchoStar Corp., parent of the DISH satellite TV business.
That company went public in June 1995, on the premise that there
was room for another pay-TV provider. By 2000, at the peak of Wall
Street’s infatuation with all things tech, EchoStar had 3.4 million sub-
scribers, an enterprise value (market value of equity, plus net debt) of
approximately $30 billion, and a reported annual loss of nearly $800 mil-
lion. Worse yet, the company was consuming cash like crazy as it sought
to build its infrastructure and customer base—and that alone would take
it off many value investors’ radar.
Fast forward five years, and the subscriber count topped 12 million.
With many of the start-up costs behind it, free cash was flowing and
growing—monthly subscriber fees are a pretty reliable income stream.
Yet at that time, in 2005, EchoStar’s enterprise value was just $17 billion.
Clearly, the market was not giving the company much credit for its cash-
generating abilities. That allowed Fairholme to purchase shares in an
excellent franchise business with a double-digit free cash flow yield while
risk-free investments were paying 5%.
Some companies produce plentiful cash flow, but their corporate
structures mask it. That’s the case with Leucadia National, a holding com-
pany with an eclectic mix of businesses. Leucadia’s portfolio of busi-
nesses resembles that of Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. While these
companies in aggregate do not necessarily produce steady cash flow for
the holding company, at the subsidiary level cash flow can be very good,
and ultimately that value will benefit the parent company. Leucadia’s free
cash flow is quite variable and unpredictable, mainly because its man-
agers are always buying and selling businesses in its portfolio. But man-
agement has proven skillful at deploying the company’s cash. Its net
worth has compounded at close to 25% per annum for almost three
decades. If you invest in a company such as Leucadia or Berkshire Hath-
[344] Introduction to Part IV

---
**[Page 397]**

away, you are banking on management’s ability to identify investments
with high free cash flow.
Leucadia and Berkshire Hathaway point to another important aspect
of evaluating free cash flow: how management deploys cash and
whether those decisions enhance shareholder value. As mentioned ear-
lier, free cash flow can either be returned to shareholders via dividends or
share repurchases, or it can be reinvested in the business. Graham and
Dodd equated cash returns to shareholders with dividends. The tax
advantages of stock buybacks were hardly considered in capital alloca-
tion decisions, and in fact, they are of little interest to the institutional
investors who dominate today’s markets.
Today, share buybacks at discounted prices are clearly preferable to
dividends. The qualifying factor here is the price. If the company buys
back undervalued stock, selling shareholders suffer while long-term
shareholders benefit. If the company buys its stock at inflated prices, sell-
ers benefit and long-term holders lose out. Value investors, having a
long-term orientation, generally look for companies that consistently
repurchase their stocks during periods of undervaluation.
Management must decide when to return cash to shareholders and
when to invest it. Earnings intelligently invested will generate higher
future levels of free cash flow. On the other hand, poorly invested earn-
ings destroy value. Warren Buffett has been an undisputed genius of cap-
ital allocation for over 50 years, and no one minds that his Berkshire
Hathaway does not pay a dividend. On the other hand, some manage-
ments, especially those in struggling industries, would benefit their
investors by returning capital to them rather than reinvesting in the busi-
ness at low rates of return.
Dividends as Signals
Traditionally, corporate boards have tended to set dividend payouts at
levels that are comfortably covered by earnings. That way, a greater share
Bruce Berkowitz [345]

---
**[Page 398]**

of earnings is retained in good times. In bad times, dividends are often
maintained even if they exceed free cash flow. A board might do that to
express its long-term confidence in the business. If earnings are growing,
a board will steadily increase the dividends, though usually at a slower
pace than earnings.
Now, investors scrutinize companies’ dividend policies as a window into
management’s thinking about the durability of the free cash flow. If
changes in cash flow were considered temporary, companies presumably
would not adjust dividends. If management believed the changes were
likely to be permanent, it would adjust dividends accordingly. If manage-
ment regarded new investment opportunities as relatively low risk, those
opportunities could be financed with debt, allowing dividends to remain
untouched. If new opportunities were viewed as relatively risky, they might
have to be financed through a reduction in the dividend. If these strategies
were honestly executed, they would help investors extrapolate from cur-
rent to likely future cash flow and hence, to equity value. In this context, a
high dividend level would be a positive factor in equity valuation.
The danger here is that management may be tempted to manipulate
the dividend to create an inappropriately favorable picture of future cash
flow. Companies under stress, such as General Motors or Citigroup have
been, are almost always late to cut their dividends. In such cases
investors who buy stocks with unusually rich dividend yields and deterio-
rating fundamentals are asking for trouble. These dividends are likely to
be sliced. Companies that pay dividends with the proceeds of newly
issued equity rather than free cash flow are similarly likely to be manipu-
lating investors through false signals. Real estate investment trusts and
income trusts, which must pay out virtually all their income to sharehold-
ers, are similarly reluctant to reduce their stated distributions.
On the other hand, companies that have free cash to distribute and
poor investment prospects should make higher dividend payouts. Also,
[346] Introduction to Part IV

---
**[Page 399]**

companies like Dell Computer and Amaz on.com that operate with signifi-
cantly negative working capital—they collect from purchasers before
they have to pay suppliers—and little fixed investment have minimal
need to reinvest earnings. Yet they stubbornly pay no dividends and
accumulate large amounts of cash.
Whose Cash Is It Anyway?
Identifying a company with a big cash stash and the ability to generate
more is a great start. But the cash doesn’t do the shareholder any good
unless management makes smart investments with it, or returns it to its
owners via dividends or share buybacks. Management talent and inten-
tions are crucial.
Sometimes there is just too much cash to ignore, even if it is under
the control of folks who won’t invest it or distribute it. In those cases
activist investors often take large stakes and pressure managers to
“unlock the value” in the company; failing that, they try to replace those
managers. One way or another, if there’s enough money in the cash regis-
ter, somebody will find a way to get it out.

Chapter 27
THE THEORY OF COMMON-
STOCK INVESTMENT
IN OUR INTRODUCTORY discussion we set forth the difficulties inherent in
efforts to apply the analytical technique to speculative situations. Since the
speculative factors bulk particularly large in common stocks, it follows that
analysis of such issues is likely to prove inconclusive and unsatisfactory;
and even where it appears to be conclusive, there is danger that it may be
misleading. At this point it is necessary to consider the function of com-
mon-stock analysis in greater detail. We must begin with three realistic
premises. The first is that common stocks are of basic importance in our
financial scheme and of fascinating interest to many people; the second is
that owners and buyers of common stocks are generally anxious to arrive
at an intelligent idea of their value; the third is that, even when the under-
lying motive of purchase is mere speculative greed, human nature desires
to conceal this unlovely impulse behind a screen of apparent logic and
good sense. To adapt the aphorism of Voltaire, it may be said that if there
were no such thing as common-stock analysis, it would be necessary to
counterfeit it.
Broad Merits of Common-stock Analysis. We are thus led to the
question: “To what extent is common-stock analysis a valid and truly
valuable exercise, and to what extent is it an empty but indispensable cer-
emony attending the wagering of money on the future of business and of
the stock market?” We shall ultimately find the answer to run somewhat
as follows: “ As far as the typical common stock is concerned—an issue
picked at random from the list—an analysis, however elaborate, is
unlikely to yield a dependable conclusion as to its attractiveness or its real
value. But in individual cases, the exhibit may be such as to permit rea-
sonably confident conclusions to be drawn from the processes of analy-
sis. ” It would follow that analysis is of positive or scientific value only in

Theory of Common-stock Investment. The Dividend Factor [349]
the case of the exceptional common stock, and that for common stocks
in general it must be regarded either as a somewhat questionable aid to
speculative judgment or as a highly illusory method of aiming at values
that defy calculation and that must somehow be calculated none the less.
Perhaps the most effective way of clarifying the subject is through
the historical approach. Such a survey will throw light not only upon
the changing status of common-stock analysis but also upon a closely
related subject of major importance, viz., the theory of common-stock
investment. We shall encounter at first a set of old established and seem-
ingly logical principles for common-stock investment. Through the
advent of new conditions, we shall find the validity of these principles
impaired. Their insufficiency will give rise to an entirely different con-
cept of common-stock selection, the so-called “new-era theory, ” which
beneath its superficial plausibility will hold possibilities of untold mis-
chief in store. With the prewar theory obsolete and the new-era theory
exploded, we must finally make the attempt to establish a new set of
logically sound and reasonably dependable principles of common-stock
investment.
History of Common-stock Analysis. Turning first to the history of
common-stock analysis, we shall find that two conflicting factors have
been at work during the past 30 years. On the one hand there has been
an increase in the investment prestige of common stocks as a class, due
chiefly to the enlarged number that have shown substantial earnings, con-
tinued dividends, and a strong financial condition. Accompanying this
progress was a considerable advance in the frequency and adequacy of
corporate statements, thus supplying the public and the securities analyst
with a wealth of statistical data. Finally, an impressive theory was con-
structed asserting the preeminence of common stocks as long-term
investments. But at the time that the interest in common stocks reached
its height, in the period between 1927 and 1929, the basis of valuation
employed by the stock-buying public departed more and more from the
factual approach and technique of security analysis and concerned itself
increasingly with the elements of potentiality and prophecy. Moreover,
the heightened instability in the affairs of industrial companies and
groups of enterprises, which has undermined the investment quality of
bonds in general, has of course been still more hostile to the maintenance
of true investment quality in common stocks.

[350] SECURITY ANALYSIS
Analysis Vitiated by Two Types of Instability.The extent to which
common-stock analysis has been vitiated by these two developments, (1)
the instability of tangibles and (2) the dominant importance of intangi-
bles, may be better realized by a contrast of specific common stocks prior
to 1920 and in more recent times. Let us consider four typical examples:
Pennsylvania Railroad; Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway; National

American Can was a typical example of a prewar speculative stock. It
was speculative for three good and sufficient reasons: (1) It paid no divi-
dend; (2) its earnings were small and irregular; (3) the issue was “watered, ”
i.e., a substantial part of its stated value represented no actual investment
in the business. By contrast, Pennsylvania, Atchison, and National Biscuit
were regarded as investment common stocks—also for three good and
sufficient reasons: (1) They showed a satisfactory record of continued

If we study the range of market price of these issues during the decade
preceding the World War (or the 1909–1918 period for National Biscuit),
we note that American Can fluctuated widely from year to year in the
fashion regularly associated with speculative media but that Pennsylva-
nia, Atchison, and National Biscuit showed much narrower variations
and evidently tended to oscillate about a base price (i.e., 97 for Atchison,
64 for Pennsylvania, and 120 for National Biscuit) that seemed to repre-
sent a well-defined view of their investment or intrinsic value.

[354] SECURITY ANALYSIS
Prewar Conception of Investment in Common Stocks. Hence
the prewar relationship between analysis and investment on the one hand
and price changes and speculation on the other may be set forth as 
follows: Investment in common stocks was confined to those showing sta-
ble dividends and fairly stable earnings; and such issues in turn were
expected to maintain a fairly stable market level. The function of analysis
was primarily to search for elements of weaknessin the picture. If the earn-
ings were not properly stated; if the balance sheet revealed a poor current
position, or the funded debt was growing too rapidly; if the physical plant
was not properly maintained; if dangerous new competition was threat-
ening, or if the company was losing ground in the industry; if the man-
agement was deteriorating or was likely to change for the worse; if there
was reason to fear for the future of the industry as a whole—any of these
defects or some other one might be sufficient to condemn the issue from
the standpoint of the cautious investor.
On the positive side, analysis was concerned with finding those issues
which met all the requirements of investment and in additionoffered the
best chance for future enhancement. The process was largely a matter of
comparing similar issues in the investment class, e.g., the group of divi-
dend-paying Northwestern railroads. Chief emphasis would be laid upon
the relative showing for past years, in particular the average earnings 
in relation to price and the stability and the trend of earnings. To a lesser
extent, the analyst sought to look into the future and to select the indus-
tries or the individual companies that were likely to show the most 
rapid growth.
Speculation Characterized by Emphasis on Future Prospects. In the
prewar period it was the well-considered view that when prime emphasis
was laid upon what was expected of the future, instead of what had been
accomplished in the past, a speculative attitude was thereby taken. Spec-
ulation, in its etymology, meant looking forward; investment was allied
to “vested interests”—to property rights and values taking root in the past.
The future was uncertain, therefore speculative; the past was known,
therefore the source of safety. Let us consider a buyer of American Can
common in 1910. He may have bought it believing that its price was going
to advance or be “put up” or that its earnings were going to increase or
that it was soon going to pay a dividend or possibly that it was destined
to develop into one of the country’s strongest industrials. From the pre-

---
**[Page 407]**

war standpoint, although one of these reasons may have been more intel-
ligent or creditable than another, each of them constituted a speculative
motive for the purchase.
Technique of Investing in Common Stocks Resembled That for Bonds.
Evidently there was a close similarity between the technique of investing
in common stocks and that of investing in bonds. The common-stock
investor, also, wanted a stable business and one showing an adequate mar-
gin of earnings over dividend requirements. Naturally he had to content
himself with a smaller margin of safety than he would demand of a bond,
a disadvantage that was offset by a larger income return (6% was stan-
dard on a good common stock compared with 4
1/2% on a high-grade
bond), by the chance of an increased dividend if the business continued
to prosper, and—generally of least importance in his eyes—by the possi-
bility of a profit. A common-stock investor was likely to consider himself
as in no very different position from that of a purchaser of second-grade
bonds; essentially his venture amounted to sacrificing a certain degree of
safety in return for larger income. The Pennsylvania and Atchison exam-
ples during the 1904–1913 decade will supply specific confirmation of
the foregoing description.
Buying Common Stocks Viewed as Taking a Share in a Business.
Another useful approach to the attitude of the prewar common-stock
investor is from the standpoint of taking an interest in a private business.
The typical common-stock investor was a business man, and it seemed
sensible to him to value any corporate enterprise in much the same man-
ner as he would value his own business. This meant that he gave at least
as much attention to the asset values behind the shares as he did to their
earnings records. It is essential to bear in mind the fact that a private busi-
ness has always been valued primarily on the basis of the “net worth” as
shown by its statement. A man contemplating the purchase of a partner-
ship or stock interest in a private undertaking will always start with the
value of that interest as shown “on the books, ” i.e., the balance sheet, and
will then consider whether or not the record and prospects are good
enough to make such a commitment attractive. An interest in a private
business may of course be sold for more or less than its proportionate
asset value; but the book value is still invariably the starting point of the
calculation, and the deal is finally made and viewed in terms of the pre-
mium or discount from book value involved.

**[Page 408]**

[356] SECURITY ANALYSIS
Broadly speaking, the same attitude was formerly taken in an invest-
ment purchase of a marketable common stock. The first point of depar-
ture was the par value, presumably representing the amount of cash or
property originally paid into the business; the second basal figure was the
book value, representing the par value plus a ratable interest in the accu-
mulated surplus. Hence in considering a common stock, investors asked
themselves: “Is this issue a desirable purchase at the premium above book
value, or the discount below book value, represented by the market
price?” “Watered stock” was repeatedly inveighed against as a deception
practiced upon the stock-buying public, who were misled by a fictitious
statement of the asset values existing behind the shares. Hence one of the
protective functions of security analysis was to discover whether or not
the value of the fixed assets, as stated on the balance sheet of a company,
fairly represented the actual cost or reasonable worth of the properties.
Investment in Common Stocks Based on Threefold Concept. We thus
see that investment in common stocks was formerly based upon the
threefold concept of: (1) a suitable and established dividend return, (2) a
stable and adequate earnings record, and (3) a satisfactory backing of tan-
gible assets. Each of these three elements could be made the subject of
careful analytical study, viewing the issue both by itself and in compari-
son with others of its class. Common-stock commitments motivated by
any other viewpoint were characterized as speculative, and it was not
expected that they should be justified by a serious analysis.
THE NEW-ERA THEORY
During the postwar period, and particularly during the latter stage of the
bull market culminating in 1929, the public acquired a completely differ-
ent attitude towards the investment merits of common stocks. Two of the
three elements above stated lost nearly all their significance, and the third,
the earnings record, took on an entirely novel complexion. The new 
theory or principle may be summed up in the sentence: “The value of a
common stock depends entirely upon what it will earn in the future. ”
From this dictum the following corollaries were drawn:
1. That the dividend rate should have slight bearing upon the value.
2. That since no relationship apparently existed between assets and
earning power, the asset value was entirely devoid of importance.
3. That past earnings were significant only to the extent that they indi-
cated what changesin the earnings were likely to take place in the future.

---
**[Page 409]**

This complete revolution in the philosophy of common-stock invest-
ment took place virtually without realization by the stock-buying public
and with only the most superficial recognition by financial observers. An
effort must be made to reach a thorough comprehension of what this
changed viewpoint really signifies. To do so we must consider it from
three angles: its causes, its consequences and its logical validity.
Causes for This Changed Viewpoint. Why did the investingpublic
turn its attention from dividends, from asset values, and from average earn-
ings to transfer it almost exclusively to the earnings trend, i.e., to the changes
in earnings expected in the future? The answer was, first, that the records
of the past were proving an undependable guide to investment; and, sec-
ond, that the rewards offered by the future had become irresistibly alluring.
The new-era concepts had their root first of all in the obsolescence of
the old-established standards. During the last generation the tempo 
of economic change has been speeded up to such a degree that the fact
of being long established has ceased to be, as once it was, a warranty of
stability. Corporations enjoying decade-long prosperity have been pre-
cipitated into insolvency within a few years. Other enterprises, which had
been small or unsuccessful or in doubtful repute, have just as quickly
acquired dominant size, impressive earnings, and the highest rating. The
major group upon which investment interest was chiefly concentrated,
viz., the railroads, failed signally to participate in the expansion of
national wealth and income and showed repeated signs of definite retro-
gression. The street railways, another important medium of investment
prior to 1914, rapidly lost the greater portion of their value as the result
of the development of new transportation agencies. The electric and gas
companies followed an irregular course during this period, since they
were harmed rather than helped by the war and postwar inflation, and
their impressive growth was a relatively recent phenomenon. The history
of industrial companies was a hodge-podge of violent changes, in which
the benefits of prosperity were so unequally and so impermanently dis-
tributed as to bring about the most unexpected failures alongside of the
most dazzling successes.
In the face of all this instability it was inevitable that the threefold basis
of common-stock investment should prove totally inadequate. Past 
earnings and dividends could no longer be considered, in themselves, an
index of future earnings and dividends. Furthermore, these future earn-

ings showed no tendency whatever to be controlled by the amount of the
actual investment in the business—the asset values—but instead
depended entirely upon a favorable industrial position and upon capable
or fortunate managerial policies. In numerous cases of receivership, the
current assets dwindled, and the fixed assets proved almost worthless.
Because of this absence of any connection between both assets and earn-
ings and between assets and realizable values in bankruptcy, less and less
attention came to be paid either by financial writers or by the general pub-
lic to the formerly important question of “net worth, ” or “book value”;
and it may be said that by 1929 book value had practically disappeared
as an element in determining the attractiveness of a security issue. It is a
significant confirmation of this point that “watered stock, ” once so burn-
ing an issue, is now a forgotten phrase.
Attention Shifted to the Trend of Earnings. Thus the prewar
approach to investment, based upon past records and tangible facts,
became outworn and was discarded. Could anything be put in its place?
A new conception was given central importance—that of trend of earn-
ings. The past was important only in so far as it showed the direction in
which the future could be expected to move. A continuous increase in
profits proved that the company was on the upgrade and promised still
better results in the future than had been accomplished to date. Con-
versely, if the earnings had declined or even remained stationary during
a prosperous period, the future must be thought unpromising, and the
issue was certainly to be avoided.
The Common-stocks-as-long-term-investments Doctrine.
Along with this idea as to what constituted the basis for common-stock
selection emerged a companion theory that common stocks represented
the most profitable and therefore the most desirable media for long-term
investment. This gospel was based upon a certain amount of research,
showing that diversified lists of common stocks had regularly increased
in value over stated intervals of time for many years past. The figures
indicated that such diversified common-stock holdings yielded both a
higher income return and a greater principal profit than purchases of
standard bonds.
The combination of these two ideas supplied the “investment theory”
upon which the 1927–1929 stock market proceeded. Amplifying the prin-
ciple stated on page 356, the theory ran as follows:

---
**[Page 411]**

1. “The value of a common stock depends on what it can earn in the future. ”
2. “Good common stocks are those which have shown a rising trend of 
earnings. ”
3. “Good common stocks will prove sound and profitable investments. ”
These statements sound innocent and plausible. Y et they concealed
two theoretical weaknesses that could and did result in untold mischief.
The first of these defects was that they abolished the fundamental 
distinctions between investment and speculation. The second was that
they ignored the price of a stock in determining whether or not it was a
desirable purchase.
New-era Investment Equivalent to Prewar Speculation. A
moment’s thought will show that “new-era investment, ” as practiced by
the public and the investment trusts, was almost identical with specula-
tion as popularly defined in preboom days. Such “investment” meant
buying common stocks instead of bonds, emphasizing enhancement of
principal instead of income, and stressing the changes of the future
instead of the facts of the established past. It would not be inaccurate to
state that new-era investment was simply old-style speculation confined
to common stocks with a satisfactory trend of earnings. The impressive
new concept underlying the greatest stock-market boom in history
appears to be no more than a thinly disguised version of the old cynical
epigram: “Investment is successful speculation. ”
Stocks Regarded as Attractive Irrespective of Their Prices.The
notion that the desirability of a common stock was entirely independent
of its price seems incredibly absurd. Y et the new-era theory led directly
to this thesis. If a public-utility stock was selling at 35 times its maximum
recorded earnings, instead of 10 times its averageearnings, which was the
preboom standard, the conclusion to be drawn was not that the stock was
now too high but merely that the standard of value had been raised.
Instead of judging the market price by established standards of value, the
new era based its standards of value upon the market price. Hence all
upper limits disappeared, not only upon the price at which a stock could
sell but even upon the price at which it would deserve to sell. This fantas-
tic reasoning actually led to the purchase at $100 per share of common
stocks earning $2.50 per share. The identical reasoning would support
the purchase of these same shares at $200, at $1,000, or at any conceiv-
able price.

[360] SECURITY ANALYSIS
An alluring corollary of this principle was that making money in the
stock market was now the easiest thing in the world. It was only neces-
sary to buy “good” stocks, regardless of price, and then to let nature take
her upward course. The results of such a doctrine could not fail to be
tragic. Countless people asked themselves, “Why work for a living when
a fortune can be made in Wall Street without working?” The ensuing
migration from business into the financial district resembled the famous
gold rush to the Klondike, except that gold was brought to Wall Street
instead of taken from it.
Investment Trusts Adopted This New Doctrine.An ironical side-
light is thrown on this 1928–1929 theory by the practice of the invest-
ment trusts. These were formed for the purpose of giving the untrained
public the benefit of expert administration of its funds—a plausible idea
and one that had been working reasonably well in England. The earliest
American investment trusts laid considerable emphasis upon certain
time-tried principles of successful investment, which they were much bet-
ter qualified to follow than the typical individual. The most important of
these principles were:
1. To buy in times of depression and low prices and to sell out in times of
prosperity and high prices.
2. To diversify holdings in many fields and probably in many countries.
3. To discover and acquire undervalued individual securities as the result of
comprehensive and expert statistical investigations.
The rapidity and completeness with which these traditional principles
disappeared from investment-trust technique is one of the many marvels
of the period. The idea of buying in times of depression was obviously
inapplicable. It suffered from the fatal weakness that investment trusts
could be organized only in good times, so that they were virtually com-
pelled to make their initial commitments in bull markets. The idea of
world-wide geographical distribution had never exerted a powerful
appeal upon the provincially minded Americans (who possibly were right
in this respect), and with things going so much better here than abroad
this principle was dropped by common consent.
Analysis Abandoned by Investment Trusts. But most paradoxical was
the early abandonment of research and analysis in guiding investment-

---
**[Page 413]**

trust policies. However, since these financial institutions owed their exis-
tence to the new-era philosophy, it was natural and perhaps only just that
they should adhere closely to it. Under its canons investment had now
become so beautifully simple that research was unnecessary and elabo-
rate statistical data a mere incumbrance. The investment process con-
sisted merely of finding prominent companies with a rising trend of
earnings and then buying their shares regardless of price. Hence the
sound policy was to buy only what every one else was buying—a select
list of highly popular and exceedingly expensive issues, appropriately
known as the “blue chips. ” The original idea of searching for the under-
valued and neglected issues dropped completely out of sight. Investment
trusts actually boasted that their portfolios consisted exclusively of the
active and standard (i.e., the most popular and highest priced) common
stocks. With but slight exaggeration, it might be asserted that under this
convenient technique of investment, the affairs of a ten-million-dollar
investment trust could be administered by the intelligence, the training
and the actual labors of a single thirty-dollar-a-week clerk.
The man in the street, having been urged to entrust his funds to the
superior skill of investment experts—for substantial compensation—was
soon reassuringly told that the trusts would be careful to buy nothing
except what the man in the street was buying himself.
The Justification Offered. Irrationality could go no further; yet it is
important to note that mass speculation can flourish only in such an
atmosphere of illogic and unreality. The self-deception of the mass spec-
ulator must, however, have its element of justification. This is usually
some generalized statement, sound enough within its proper field, but
twisted to fit the speculative mania. In real estate booms, the “reasoning”
is usually based upon the inherent permanence and growth of land val-
ues. In the new-era bull market, the “rational” basis was the record of
long-term improvement shown by diversified common-stock holdings.
A Sound Premise Used to Support an Unsound Conclusion.
There was, however, a radical fallacy involved in the new-era application
of this historical fact. This should be apparent from even a superficial
examination of the data contained in the small and rather sketchy vol-
ume from which the new-era theory may be said to have sprung. The
book is entitled Common Stocks as Long Term Investments , by Edgar
Theory of Common-stock Investment. The Dividend Factor [361]

**[Page 414]**

[362] SECURITY ANALYSIS
Lawrence Smith, published in 1924.1 Common stocks were shown to have
a tendency to increase in value with the years, for the simple reason that
they earned more than they paid out in dividends and thus the reinvested
earnings added to their worth. In a representative case, the company
would earn an average of 9%, pay 6% in dividends, and add 3% to sur-
plus. With good management and reasonable luck the fair value of the
stock would increase with its book value, at the annual rate of 3% com-
pounded. This was, of course, a theoretical rather than a standard pattern,
but the numerous instances of results poorer than “normal” might be off-
set by examples of more rapid growth.
The attractiveness of common stocks for the long pull thus lay essen-
tially in the fact that they earned more than the bond-interest rate upon
their cost. This would be true, typically, of a stock earning $10 and sell-
ing at 100. But as soon as the price was advanced to a much higher price
in relation to earnings, this advantage disappeared, and with it disap-
peared the entire theoretical basis for investment purchases of common
stocks. When in 1929 investors paid $200 per share for a stock earning
$8, they were buying an earning power no greater than the bond-inter-
est rate, without the extra protection afforded by a prior claim. Hence in
using the past performances of common stocks as the reason for paying
prices 20 to 40 times their earnings, the new-era exponents were starting
with a sound premise and twisting it into a woefully unsound conclusion.
In fact their rush to take advantage of the inherent attractiveness of
common stocks itself produced conditions entirely different from those
which had given rise to this attractiveness and upon which it basically
depended, viz., the fact that earnings had averaged some 10% on market
price. As we have seen, Edgar Lawrence Smith plausibly explained the
growth of common-stock values as arising from the building up of asset
values through the reinvestment of surplus earnings. Paradoxically
enough, the new-era theory that exploited this finding refused to accord
the slightest importance to the asset values behind the stocks it favored.
Furthermore, the validity of Mr. Smith’s conclusions rested necessarily
upon the assumption that common stocks could be counted on to behave

fessor Bosland’s book.

in the future about as they had in the past. Y et the new-era theory threw
out of account the past earnings of corporations except in so far as they
were regarded as pointing to a trend for the future.
Examples Showing Emphasis on Trend of Earnings. Take three com-
panies with the following exhibits:
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Company A Company B Company C
(Electric (Bangor & (Chicago 
Y ear Power & Light) Aroostook R. R.) Y ellow Cab)
1925 $1.01 $6.22 $5.52
1926 1.45 8.69 5.60
1927 2.09 8.41 4.54
1928 2.37 6.94 4.58
1929 2.98 8.30 4.47
5-year average $1.98 $7.71 $4.94
High price, 1929 865/8 903/8 35
The 1929 high prices for these three companies show that the new-
era attitude was enthusiastically favorable to Company A, unimpressed
by Company B, and definitely hostile to Company C. The market consid-
ered Company A shares worth more than twice as much as Company C
shares, although the latter earned 50% more per share than Company A
in 1929 and its average earnings were 150% greater.2
Average vs. Trend of Earnings. These relationships between price
and earnings in 1929 show definitely that the past exhibit was no longer
a measure of normal earning power but merely a weathervane to show
which way the winds of profit were blowing. That the average earnings
had ceased to be a dependable measure of future earnings must indeed
be admitted, because of the greater instability of the typical business to
which we have previously alluded. But it did not follow at all that the trend
of earnings must therefore be a more dependable guide than the average;
and even if it were more dependable, it would not necessarily provide a
safe basis, entirely by itself, for investment.

performance of these three companies.

[364] SECURITY ANALYSIS
The accepted assumption that because earnings have moved in a cer-
tain direction for some years past they will continue to move in that direc-
tion is fundamentally no different from the discarded assumption that
because earnings averaged a certain amount in the past they will continue
to average about that amount in the future. It may well be that the earn-
ings trend offers a more dependable clue to the future than does the earn-
ings average. But at best such an indication of future results is far from
certain, and, more important still, there is no method of establishing a log-
ical relationship between trend and price.
3 This means that the value placed
upon a satisfactory trend must be wholly arbitrary, and hence speculative,
and hence inevitably subject to exaggeration and later collapse.
Danger in Projecting Trends into the Future.There are several reasons
why we cannot be sure that a trend of profits shown in the past will con-
tinue in the future. In the broad economic sense, there is the law of dimin-
ishing returns and of increasing competition which must finally flatten
out any sharply upward curve of growth. There is also the flow and ebb
of the business cycle, from which the particular danger arises that the
earnings curve will look most impressive on the very eve of a serious 
setback. Considering the 1927–1929 period we observe that since the
trend-of-earnings theory was at bottom only a pretext to excuse rank
speculation under the guise of “investment, ” the profit-mad public was
quite willing to accept the flimsiest evidence of the existence of a favor-
able trend. Rising earnings for a period of five, or four, or even three years
only, were regarded as an assurance of uninterrupted future growth and
a warrant for projecting the curve of profits indefinitely upward.
3 The new-era investment theory was conspicuously reticent on the mathematical side. The
relationship between price and earnings, or price and trend of earnings was anything that
the market pleased to make it (note the price of Electric Power and Light compared with its
earnings record given on p. 363). If an attempt were to be made to give a mathematical
expression to the underlying idea of valuation, it might be said that it was based on the
derivative of the earnings, stated in terms of time. In recent years more serious efforts have
been made to establish a mathematical basis for discounting expected future earnings or div-
idends. See Gabriel Preinreich, The Theory of Dividends, New Y ork, 1935; and J. B. Williams,
The Theory of Investment Value, Cambridge, Mass., 1938. The latter work is built on the
premise that the value of a common stock is equal to the present value of all future divi-
dends. This principle gives rise to an elaborate series of mathematical equations designed to
calculate exactly what a common stock is worth, assuming certain vital facts about future
earnings, distribution policy and interest rates.

Example: The prevalent heedlessness on this score was most evident
in connection with the numerous common-stock flotations during this
period. The craze for a showing of rising profits resulted in the promo-
tion of many industrial enterprises that had been favored by temporary
good fortune and were just approaching, or had already reached, the peak
of their prosperity. A typical example of this practice is found in the offer-
ing of preferred and common stock of Schletter and Zander, Inc., a man-
ufacturer of hosiery (name changed later to Signature Hosiery Company).
The company was organized in 1929, to succeed a company organized in
1922, and the financing was effected by the sale of 44,810 shares of $3.50
convertible preferred shares at $50 per share and 261,349 voting-trust cer-
tificates for common stock at $26 per share. The offering circular pre-
sented the following exhibit of earnings from the constituent properties:

Y ear taxes preferred common

1927 563,856 12.58 1.56
1928 1,021,308 22.79 3.31
The subsequent record was as follows:
1929 812,136 18.13 2.51
1930 179,875(d) 4.01(d) 1.81(d)
In 1931 liquidation of the company’s assets was begun, and a total of
$17 per share in liquidating dividends on the preferred had been paid up
to the end of 1933. (Assets then remaining for liquidation were negligi-
ble.) The common was wiped out.
This example illustrates one of the paradoxes of financial history, viz.,
that at the very period when the increasing instability of individual com-
panies had made the purchase of common stocks far more precarious
than before, the gospel of common stocks as safe and satisfactory invest-
ments was preached to and avidly accepted by the American public.

Chapter 28
NEWER CANONS OF COMMON-
STOCK INVESTMENT
OUR EXTENDED discussion of the theory of common-stock investment has
thus far led only to negative conclusions. The older approach, centering
upon the conception of a stable average earning power, appears to have
been vitiated by the increasing instability of the typical business. As for
the new-era view, which turned upon the earnings trend as the sole cri-
terion of value, whatever truth may lurk in this generalization, its blind
adoption as a basis for common-stock purchases, without calculation or
restraint, was certain to end in an appalling debacle. Is there anything at
all left, then, of the idea of sound investment in common stocks?
A careful review of the preceding criticism will show that it need not
be so destructive to the notion of investment in common stocks as a first
impression would suggest. The instability of individual companies may
conceivably be offset by means of thoroughgoing diversification. More-
over, the trend of earnings, although most dangerous as a sole basis for
selection, may prove a useful indication of investment merit. If this
approach is a sound one, there may be formulated an acceptable canon
of common-stock investment, containing the following elements:
1. Investment is conceived as a group operation, in which diversifica-
tion of risk is depended upon to yield a favorable average result.
2. The individual issues are selected by means of qualitative and quan-
titative tests corresponding to those employed in the choice of fixed-value
investments.
3. A greater effort is made, than in the case of bond selection, to deter-
mine the future outlook of the issues considered.
Whether or not a policy of common-stock acquisition based upon the
foregoing principles deserves the title of investment is undoubtedly open
to debate. The importance of the question, and the lack of well-defined

and authoritative views thereon, compel us to weigh here the leading
arguments for and against this proposition.
THREE GENERAL APPROACHES
Secular Expansion as Basis. May the ownership of a carefully
selected, diversified group of common stocks, purchased at reasonable
prices, be characterized as a sound investment policy? An affirmative
answer may be developed from any one of three different kinds of
assumptions relating to the future of American business and the policy
of selection that is followed. The first will posit that certain basic and
long-established elements in this country’s economic experience may still
be counted upon. These are (1) that our national wealth and earning
power will increase, (2) that such increase will reflect itself in the
increased resources and profits of our important corporations, and (3)
that such increases will in the main take place through the normal process
of investment of new capital and reinvestment of undistributed earnings.
The third part of this assumption signifies that a broad causal connection
exists between accumulating surplus and future earning power, so that
common-stock selection is not a matter purely of chance or guesswork
but should be governed by an analysis of past records in relation to cur-
rent market prices.
If these fundamental conditions still obtain, then common stocks with
suitable exhibits should on the whole present the same favorable oppor-
tunities in the future as they have for generations past. The cardinal defect
of instability may not be regarded, therefore, as menacing the long-range
development of common stocks as a whole. It does indeed exert a pow-
erful temporary effect upon all business through the variations of the eco-
nomic cycle, and it has permanently adverse effects upon individual
enterprises and single industries. But of these two dangers, the latter may
be offset in part by careful selection and chiefly by wide diversification;
the former may be guarded against by unvarying insistence upon the rea-
sonableness of the price paid for each purchase.
They would be rash authors who would express themselves unequiv-
ocably for or against this basic assumption that American business will
develop in the future pretty much as in the past. In our Introduction we
point out that the experience of the last fifteen years weighs against this

**[Page 420]**

proposition. Without seeking to prophesy the future, may it not suffice
to declare that the investor cannot safely rely upon a general growth of
earnings to provide both safety and profit over the long pull? In this
respect it would seem that we are back to the investor’s attitude in 1913—
with the difference that his caution then seemed needlessly blind to the
powerful evidences of secular growth inherent in our economy. Our cau-
tion today would appear, at least, to be based on bitter experience and on
the recognition of some newer and less promising factors in the whole
business picture.
Individual Growth as Basis of Selection. Those who would reject
the suggestion that common-stock investment may be founded securely
on a general secular expansion may be attracted to a second approach.
This stresses the element of selectivity and is based on the premise that
certain favored companiesmay be relied on to grow steadily. Hence such
companies, when located, can be bought with confidence as long-term
investments. This philosophy of investment is set forth at some length in
the 1938 report of National Investors Corporation, an investment trust,
from which we quote as follows:
The studies by this organization, directed specifically toward improved pro-
cedure in selection, afford evidence that the common stocks of growth com-
panies—that is, companies whose earnings move forward from cycle to cycle,
and are only temporarily interrupted by periodic business depressions—offer
the most effective medium of investment in the field of common stocks,
either in terms of dividend return or longer term capital appreciation. We
believe that this general conclusion can be demonstrated statistically and is
supported by economic analysis and practical reasoning.
In considering this statement critically, we must start with the
emphatic but rather obvious assertion that the investor who can success-
fully identify such “growth companies” when their shares are available at
reasonable prices is certain to do superlatively well with his capital. Nor
can it be denied that there have been investors capable of making such
selections with a high degree of accuracy and that they have benefited
hugely from their foresight and good judgment. But the real question is
whether or not all careful and intelligent investors can follow this policy
with fair success.

Three Aspects of the Problem. Actually the problem falls into three
parts: First, what is meant by a “growth company”? Second, can the
investor identify such concerns with reasonable accuracy? Third, to what
extent does the price paid for such stocks affect the success of the program?
1. What Are Growth Companies?The National Investors Corporation
discussion defined growth companies as those “whose earnings move for-
ward from cycle to cycle. ” How many cycles are needed to meet this def-
inition? The fact of the matter seems to be that prior to 1930 a large
proportion of all publicly owned American businesses grew from cycle
to cycle. The distinguishing characteristic of growth companies, as now
understood, developed only in the period between 1929 and 1936–1937.
In this one cycle we find that most companies failed to regain their full
depression losses. The minority that did so stand out from the rest, and
it is these which are now given the complimentary title of “growth com-
panies. ” But since this distinction is in reality based on performance dur-
ing a single cycle, how sure can the investor be that it will be maintained
over the longer future?
It is true, from what we have previously said, that many of the com-
panies that expanded from 1929 to 1937 had participated in the general
record of growth prior to 1929, so that they combine the advantages of a
long period of upbuilding and an exceptional ability to expand in the last
decade. The following are examples of large and well-known companies
of this class:
Air Reduction Monsanto Chemical
Allis Chalmers Owens-Illinois Glass
Coca-Cola J. C. Penney
Commercial Credit Procter & Gamble
Dow Chemical Sherwin-Williams Paint
Du Pont Standard Oil of New Jersey
International Business Machines Scott Paper
International Nickel Union Carbide and Carbon
Libbey-Owens-Ford
2. Can the Investor Identify Them? But our natural enthusiasm for
such excellent records is tempered somewhat by a sobering considera-
tion. This is the fact that, viewed historically, most successful companies

---
**[Page 422]**

of the past are found to have pursued a well-defined life cycle, consisting
first of a series of struggles and setbacks; second, of a halcyon period of
prosperity and persistent growth; which in turn passes over into a final
phase of supermaturity—characterized by a slackening of expansion and
perhaps an actual loss of leadership or even profitability.
1 It follows that
a business that has enjoyed a very long period of increasing earnings may
ipso facto be nearing its own “saturation point. ” Hence the seeker for
growth stocks really faces a dilemma; for if he chooses newer companies
with a short record of expansion, he runs the risk of being deceived by a
temporary prosperity; and if he chooses enterprises that have advanced
through several business cycles, he may find this apparent strength to be
the harbinger of coming weakness.
We see, therefore, that the identification of a growth company is not
so simple a matter as it may at first appear. It cannot be accomplished
solely by an examination of the statistics and records but requires a con-
siderable supplement of special investigation and of business judgment.
Proponents of the growth-company principle of investment are wont cur-
rently to lay great emphasis on the element of industrial research. In the
absence of general business expansion, exceptional gains are likely to be
made by companies supplying new products or processes. These in turn
are likely to emerge from research laboratories. The profits realized from
cellophane, ethyl gas and various plastics, and from advances in the arts
of radio, photography, refrigeration, aeronautics, etc., have created a nat-
ural enthusiasm for research as a business asset and a natural tendency
to consider the possession of research facilities as the sine qua non of
industrial progress.
Still here, too, caution is needed. If the mere ownership of a research
laboratory could guarantee a successful future, every company in the land
would have one. Hence, the investor must pay heed to the kind of facili-
ties owned, the abilities of the researchers and the potentialities of the
field under investigation. It is not impossible to study these points suc-
cessfully, but the task is not easy, and the chance of error is great.
3. Does the Price Discount Potential Growth? The third source of dif-
ficulty is perhaps the greatest. Assuming a fair degree of confidence on

the part of the investor that the company will expand in the future, what
price is he justified in paying for this attractive element? Obviously, if he
can get a good future for nothing, i.e., if the price reflects only the past
record, he is making a sound investment. But this is not the case, of
course, if the market itself is counting on future growth. Characteristically,
stocks thought to have good prospects sell at relatively high prices. How
can the investor tell whether or not the price is too high? We think that
there is no good answer to this question—in fact we are inclined to think
that even if one knew for a certainty just what a company is fated to earn
over a long period of years, it would still be impossible to tell what is 
a fair price to pay for it today. It follows that once the investor pays a 
substantial amount for the growth factor, he is inevitably assuming certain
kinds of risk; viz., that the growth will be less than he anticipates, that 
over the long pull he will have paid too much for what he gets, that for a
considerable period the market will value the stock less optimistically
than he does.
On the other hand, assume that the investor strives to avoid paying a
high premium for future prospects by choosing companies about which
he is personally optimistic, although they are not favorites of the stock
market. No doubt this is the type of judgment that, if sound, will prove
most remunerative. But, by the very nature of the case, it must represent
the activity of strong-minded and daring individuals rather than invest-
ment in accordance with accepted rules and standards.
2
May Such Purchases Be Described as Investment Commitments? This
has been a longish discussion because the subject is important and not
too well comprehended in Wall Street. Our emphasis has been laid more
on the pitfalls of investing for future growth than on its advantages. But
we repeat that this method may be followed successfully if it is pursued
with skill, intelligence and diligent study. If so, is it appropriate to call such
purchases by the name of “investment”? Our answer is “yes, ” provided
that two factors are present: the first, already mentioned, that the elements
affecting the future are examined with real care and a wholesome

scepticism, rather than accepted quickly via some easy generalization; the
second, that the price paid be not substantially different from what a pru-
dent business man would be willing to pay for a similar opportunity pre-
sented to him to invest in a private undertaking over which he could
exercise control.
We believe that the second criterion will supply a useful touchstone
to determine whether the buyer is making a well-considered and legiti-
mate commitment in an enterprise with an attractive future, or instead,
under the guise of “investment, ” he is really taking a flier in a popular
stock or else letting his private enthusiasm run away with his judgment.
It will be argued, perhaps, that common-stock investments such as we
have been discussing may properly be made at a considerably higher price
than would be justified in the case of a private business, first, because 
of the great advantage of marketability that attaches to listed stocks and,
second, because the large size and financial power of publicly owned com-
panies make them inherently more attractive than any private enterprise
could be. As to the second point, the price to be paid should suitably reflect
any advantages accruing by reason of size and financial strength, but this
criterion does not really depend on whether the company is publicly or
privately owned. On the first point, there is room for some difference of
opinion whether or not the ability to control a private business affords a
full counterweight (in value analysis) to the advantage of marketability
enjoyed by a listed stock. To those who believe marketability is more valu-
able than control, we might suggest that in any event the premium to be
paid for this advantage cannot well be placed above, say, 20% of the value
otherwise justified without danger of introducing a definitely speculative
element into the picture.
Selection Based on Margin-of-safety Principle. The third
approach to common-stock investment is based on the margin-of-safety
principle. If the analyst is convinced that a stock is worth more than he
pays for it, and if he is reasonably optimistic as to the company’s future,
he would regard the issue as a suitable component of a group investment
in common stocks. This attack on the problem lends itself to two possi-
ble techniques. One is to buy at times when the general market is low ,
measured by quantitative standards of value. Presumably the purchases
would then be confined to representative and fairly active issues. The
[372] SECURITY ANALYSIS

**[Page 425]**

Theory of Common-stock Investment. The Dividend Factor [373]
other technique would be employed to discover undervalued individual
common stocks, which presumably are available even when the general
market is not particularly low. In either case the “margin of safety” resides
in the discount at which the stock is selling below its minimum intrinsic
value, as measured by the analyst. But with respect to the hazards and the
psychological factors involved, the two approaches differ considerably.
Let us discuss them in their order.
Factors Complicating Efforts to Exploit General Market Swings. A
glance at the chart on page 6, showing the fluctuations of common-stock
prices since 1900, would suggest that prices are recurrently too high and
too low and that consequently there should be repeated opportunities
to buy stocks at less than their value and to sell them out later at fair
value or higher. A crude method of doing this—but one apparently
encouraged by the chart itself—would consist simply of drawing a
straight line through the approximate midpoints of past market swings
and then planning to buy somewhere below this line and to sell some-
where above it.
Perhaps such a “system” would be as practical as any, but the analyst
is likely to insist on a more scientific approach. One possible refinement
would operate as follows:
1. Select a diversified list of leading industrial common stocks.
2. Determine a base or “normal” value for the group by capitalizing
their average earnings at some suitable figure, related to the going long-
term interest rate.
3. Determine a buying point at some percentage below this normal
value and a selling point above it. (Or buying and selling may be done
“on a scale down” and “on a scale up. ”)
A method of this kind has plausible logic to recommend it, and it is
favored also by an age-old tradition that success in the stock market 
is gained by buying at depressed levels and selling out when the public is
optimistic. But the reader will suspect at once that there is a catch to it
somewhere. What are its drawbacks?
As we see it, the difficulties attending this idea are threefold: First,
although the general pattern of the market’s behavior may be properly
anticipated, the specific buying and selling points may turn out to have
been badly chosen, and the operator may miss his opportunity at one
extreme or the other. Second, there is always a chance that the character

---
**[Page 426]**

of the market’s behavior may change significantly, so that a scheme of
operation that would have worked well in the past will cease to be prac-
ticable. Third, the method itself requires a considerable amount of human
fortitude. It generally involves buying and selling when the prevalent psy-
chology favors the opposite course, watching one’s shares go lower after
purchase and higher after sale and often staying out of the market for long
periods ( e.g., 1927–1930) when most people are actively interested in
stocks. But despite these disadvantages, which we do not minimize, it is
our view that this method has a good deal to commend it to those tem-
peramentally qualified to follow it.
The Undervalued-individual-issue Approach.The other application of
the principle of investing in undervalued common stocks is directed at
individual issues, which upon analysis appear to be worth substantially
more than they are selling for. It is rare that a common stock will appear
satisfactory from every qualitative angle and at the same time will be
found to be selling at a low price by such quantitative standards as earn-
ings, dividends, and assets. Issues of this type would undoubtedly be eli-
gible for a group purchase that would fulfill our supplementary criterion
of “investment” given in Chap. 4. (“ An investment operation is one that
can be justified on both qualitative and quantitative grounds. ”)
Of more practical importance is the question whether or not invest-
ment can be successfully carried on in common stocks that appear cheap
from the quantitative angle and that—upon study—seem to have average
prospects for the future. Securities of this type can be found in reasonable
abundance, as a result of the stock market’s obsession with companies con-
sidered to have unusually good prospects of growth. Because of this empha-
sis on the growth factor, quite a number of enterprises that are long
established, well financed, important in their industries and presumably
destined to stay in business and make profits indefinitely in the future, but
that have no speculative or growth appeal, tend to be discriminated against
by the stock market—especially in years of subnormal profits—and to sell
for considerably less than the business would be worth to a private owner.

[374] SECURITY ANALYSIS
3 Note that we have applied the touchstone of “value to a private investor” to justify two differ-
ent types of investmentin common stocks: (1) purchase of issues thought to have exceptional
prospects at no higher price than would be paid for a corresponding interest in a private busi-
ness, and (2) purchase of issues with good records and average prospects at a much lowerprice
than the business is worth to a private owner. See Appendix Note 45, p. 778 on accompanying
CD, for the exhibit of an issue of the latter type (Swift and Company).

**[Page 427]**

Theory of Common-stock Investment. The Dividend Factor [375]
We incline strongly to the belief that this last criterion—a price far less
than value to a private owner—will constitute a sound touchstone for the
discovery of true investment opportunities in common stocks. This view
runs counter to the convictions and practice of most people seeking to
invest in equities, including practically all the investment trusts. Their
emphasis is mainly on long-term growth, prospects for the next year, or
the indicated trend of the stock market itself. Undoubtedly any of these
three viewpoints may be followed successfully by those especially well
equipped by experience and native ability to exploit them. But we are not
so sure that any of these approaches can be developed into a system or
technique that can be confidently followed by everyone of sound intelli-
gence who has studied it with care. Hence we must raise our solitary voice
against the use of the term investment to characterize these methods of
operating in common stocks, however profitable they may be to the truly
skillful. Trading in the market, forecasting next year’s results for various
businesses, selecting the best media for long-term expansion—all these
have a useful place in Wall Street. But we think that the interests of
investors and of Wall Street as an institution would be better served if
operations based primarily on these factors were called by some other
name than investment.
Whether or not our own concept of common-stock investment is a
valid one may be more intelligently considered after we have given
extended treatment to the chief factors that enter into a statistical analy-
sis of a stock issue. The need for such analysis is quite independent of our
investment philosophy. After all, common stocks exist and are actively
dealt in by the public. Those who buy and sell will properly seek to arm
themselves with an adequate knowledge of financial practice and with the
tools and technique necessary for an intelligent analysis of corporate
statements.
Such information and equipment for the common-stock investor
form the subject matter of the following chapters.

THE DIVIDEND FACTOR IN COMMON-
STOCK ANALYSIS
A NATURAL classification of the elements entering into the valuation of a
common stock would be under the three headings:
1. The dividend rate and record.
2. Income-account factors (earning power).
3. Balance-sheet factors (asset value).
The dividend rate is a simple fact and requires no analysis, but its exact
significance is exceedingly difficult to appraise. From one point of view
the dividend rate is all-important, but from another and equally valid
standpoint it must be considered an accidental and minor factor. A basic
confusion has grown up in the minds of managements and stockholders
alike as to what constitutes a proper dividend policy. The result has been
to create a definite conflict between two aspects of common-stock own-
ership: one being the possession of a marketable security, and the other
being the assumption of a partnership interest in a business. Let us 
consider the matter in detail from this twofold approach.
Dividend Return as a Factor in Common-stock Investment.
Until recent years the dividend return was the overshadowing factor in
common-stock investment. This point of view was based on simple logic.
The prime purpose of a business corporation is to pay dividends to its
owners. A successful company is one that can pay dividends regularly and
presumably increase the rate as time goes on. Since the idea of investment
is closely bound up with that of dependable income, it follows that invest-
ment in common stocks would ordinarily be confined to those with a
well-established dividend. It would follow also that the price paid for an
investment common stock would be determined chiefly by the amount
of the dividend.

Theory of Common-stock Investment. The Dividend Factor [377]
We have seen that the traditional common-stock investor sought to
place himself as nearly as possible in the position of an investor in a bond
or a preferred stock. He aimed primarily at a steady income return, which
in general would be both somewhat larger and somewhat less certain than
that provided by good senior securities. Excellent illustrations of the effect
of this attitude upon the price of common stocks are afforded by 
the records of the earnings, dividends and annual price variations of
American Sugar Refining between 1907 and 1913 and of Atchison,
Topeka, and Santa Fe Railway between 1916 and 1925 presented herewith.

**[Page 430]**

The market range of both issues is surprisingly narrow, considering
the continuous gyrations of the stock market generally during those peri-
ods. The most striking feature of the exhibit is the slight influence exer-
cised both by the irregular earnings of American Sugar and by the
exceptionally well-maintained and increasing earning power on the part
of Atchison. It is clear that the price of American Sugar was dominated
throughout by its $7 rate and that of Atchison by its $6 rate, even though
the earnings records would apparently have justified an entirely different
range of relative market values.
Established Principle of Withholding Dividends.We have, there-
fore, on the one hand an ingrained and powerfully motivated tradition
which centers investment interest upon the present and past dividend
rate. But on the other hand we have an equally authoritative and well-
established principle of corporate management which subordinates the
current dividend to the future welfare of the company and its sharehold-
ers. It is considered proper managerial policy to withhold current earn-
ings from stockholders, for the sake of any of the following advantages:
1. To strengthen the financial (working-capital) position.
2. To increase productive capacity.
3. To eliminate an original overcapitalization.
When a management withholds and reinvests profits, thus building
up an accumulated surplus, it claims confidently to be acting for the best
interests of the shareholders. For by this policy the continuance of the
established dividend rate is undoubtedly better assured, and furthermore
a gradual but continuous increase in the regular payment is thereby made
possible. The rank and file of stockholders will give such policies their
support, either because they are individually convinced that this proce-
dure redounds to their advantage or because they accept uncritically the
authority of the managements and bankers who recommend it.
But this approval by stockholders of what is called a “conservative div-
idend policy” has about it a peculiar element of the perfunctory and even
the reluctant. The typical investor would most certainly prefer to have his
dividend today and let tomorrow take care of itself. No instances are on
record in which the withholding of dividends for the sake of future prof-
its has been hailed with such enthusiasm as to advance the price of the

stock. The direct opposite has invariably been true. Given two companies
in the same general position and with the same earning power, the one pay-
ing the larger dividend will always sell at the higher price.
Policy of Withholding Dividends Questionable.This is an arresting fact,
and it should serve to call into question the traditional theory of corpo-
rate finance that the smaller the percentage of earnings paid out in divi-
dends the better for the company and its stockholders. Although investors
have been taught to pay lip service to this theory, their instincts—and per-
haps their better judgment—are in revolt against it. If we try to bring a
fresh and critical viewpoint to bear upon this subject, we shall find that
weighty objections may be leveled against the accepted dividend policy of
American corporations.
Examining this policy more closely, we see that it rests upon two quite
distinct assumptions. The first is that it is advantageous to the stockhold-
ers to leave a substantial part of the annual earnings in the business; the
second is that it is desirable to maintain a steady dividend rate in the face
of fluctuations in profits. As to the second point, there would be no ques-
tion at all, provided the dividend stability is achieved without too great
sacrifice in the amount of the dividend. Assume that the earnings vary
between $5 and $15 annually over a period of years, averaging $10. No
doubt the stockholder’s advantage would be best served by maintaining
a stable dividend rate of $8, sometimes drawing upon the surplus to
maintain it, but on the average increasing the surplus at the rate of $2 per
share annually.
This would be an ideal arrangement. But in practice it is rarely fol-
lowed. We find that stability of dividends is usually accomplished by the
simple expedient of paying out a small partof the average earnings. By a
reductio ad absurdum it is clear that any company that earned $10 per
share on the average could readily stabilize its dividend at $1. The ques-
tion arises very properly if the shareholders might not prefer a much
larger aggregate dividend, even with some irregularity. This point is well
illustrated in the case of Atchison.
The Case of Atchison. Atchison maintained its dividend at the annual
rate of $6 for the 15 years between 1910 and 1924. During this time the
average earnings were in excess of $12 per share, so that the stability was
attained by withholding over half the earnings from the stockholders.
Eventually this policy bore fruit in an advance of the dividend to $10,

---
**[Page 432]**

which rate was paid between 1927 and 1931, and was accompanied by a
rise in the market price to nearly $300 per share in 1929. Within 
six months after the last payment at the $10 rate (in December 1931) the
dividend was omitted entirely. Viewed critically, the stability of the Atchi-
son dividend between 1910 and 1924 must be considered as of dubious
benefit to the stockholders. During its continuance they received an
unduly small return in relation to the earnings; when the rate was finally
advanced, the importance attached to such a move promoted excessive
speculation in the shares; finally, the reinvestment of the enormous sums
out of earnings failed to protect the shareholders from a complete loss of
income in 1932. Allowance must be made, of course, for the unprece-
dented character of the depression in 1932. But the fact remains that the
actual operating losses in dollars per share up to the passing of the divi-
dend were entirely insignificant in comparison with the surplus accumu-
lated out of the profits of previous years.
United States Steel, Another Example. The Atchison case illustrates
the two major objections to what is characterized and generally approved
of as a “conservative dividend policy. ” The first objection is that stock-
holders receive both currently and ultimatelytoo low a return in relation
to the earnings of their property; the second is that the “saving up of prof-
its for a rainy day” often fails to safeguard even the moderate dividend
rate when the rainy day actually arrives. A similarly striking example of
the ineffectiveness of a large accumulated surplus is shown by that lead-
ing industrial enterprise, United States Steel.

Theory of Common-stock Investment. The Dividend Factor [381]
The Merits of “Plowing-back” Earnings. These examples serve
to direct our critical attention to the other assumption on which 
American dividend policies are based, viz., that it is advantageous to the
stockholders if a large portion of the annual earnings are retained in the
business. This may well be true, but in determining its truth a number
of factors must be considered that are usually left out of account. The
customary reasoning on this point may be stated in the form of a syllo-
gism, as follows:
Major premise—Whatever benefits the company benefits the stockholders.
Minor premise—A company is benefited if its earnings are retained
rather than paid out in dividends.
Conclusion—Stockholders are benefited by the withholding of corporate
earnings.
The weakness of the foregoing reasoning rests of course in the major
premise. Whatever benefits a business benefits its owners, provided the
benefit is not conferred upon the corporation at the expense of the stock-
holders. Taking money away from the stockholders and presenting it to
the company will undoubtedly strengthen the enterprise, but whether or
not it is to the owners’ advantage is an entirely different question. It is
customary to commend managements for “plowing earnings back into
the property”; but, in measuring the benefits from such a policy, the time
element is usually left out of account. It stands to reason that, if a busi-
ness paid out only a small part of its earnings in dividends, the value of
the stock should increase over a period of years, but it is by no means so
certain that this increase will compensate the stockholders for the divi-
dends withheld from them, particularly if interest on these amounts is
compounded.
An inductive study would undoubtedly show that the earning power
of corporations does not in general expand proportionately with increases
in accumulated surplus. Assuming that the reported earnings were actu-
ally available for distribution, then stockholders in general would certainly
fare better in dollars and cents if they drew out practically all of these
earnings in dividends. An unconscious realization of this fact has much
to do with the tendency of common stocks paying liberal dividends to
sell higher than others with the same earning power but paying out only
a small part thereof.

Dividend Policies Arbitrary and Sometimes Selfishly Deter-
mined. One of the obstacles in the way of an intelligent understanding
by stockholders of the dividend question is the accepted notion that the
determination of dividend policies is entirely a managerial function, in
the same way as the general running of the business. This is legally true,
and the courts will not interfere with the dividend action or inaction
except upon an exceedingly convincing showing of unfairness. But if
stockholders’ opinions were properly informed, it would insist upon cur-
tailing the despotic powers given the directorate over the dividend pol-
icy. Experience shows that these unrestricted powers are likely to be
abused for various reasons. Boards of directors usually consist largely of
executive officers and their friends. The officers are naturally desirous of
retaining as much cash as possible in the treasury, in order to simplify
their financial problems; they are also inclined to expand the business
persistently for the sake of personal aggrandizement and to secure higher
salaries. This is a leading cause of the unwise increase of manufacturing
facilities which has proved recurrently one of the chief unsettling factors
in our economic situation.
The discretionary power over the dividend policy may also be abused
in more sinister fashion, sometimes to permit the acquisition of shares at
an unduly low price, at other times to facilitate unloading at a high quo-
tation. The heavy surtaxes imposed upon large incomes frequently make
it undesirable from the standpoint of the large stockholders that earnings
be paid out in dividends. Hence dividend policies may be determined at
times from the standpoint of the taxable status of the large stockholders
who control the directorate. This is particularly true in cases where these
dominant stockholders receive substantial salaries as executives. In such
cases they are perfectly willing to leave their share of the earnings in the
corporate treasury, since the latter is under their control and since by so
doing they retain control over the earnings accruing to the other stock-
holders as well.
Arbitrary Control of Dividend Policy Complicates Analysis of
Common Stocks. Viewing American corporate dividend policies as a
whole, it cannot be said that the virtually unlimited power given the man-
agement on this score has redounded to the benefit of the stockholders.
In entirely too many cases the right to pay out or withhold earnings at will
is exercised in an unintelligent or inequitable manner. Dividend policies

are often so arbitrarily managed as to introduce an additional uncertainty
in the analysis of a common stock. Besides the difficulty of judging the
earning power, there is the second difficulty of predicting what part of the
earnings the directors will see fit to disburse in dividends.
It is important to note that this feature is peculiar to American cor-
porate finance and has no close counterpart in the other important coun-
tries. The typical English, French, or German company pays out
practically all the earnings of each year, except those carried to reserves.
1
Hence they do not build up large profit-and-loss surpluses, such as are
common in the United States. Capital for expansion purposes is provided
abroad not out of undistributed earnings but through the sale of addi-
tional stock. To some extent, perhaps, the reserve accounts shown in for-
eign balance sheets will serve the same purpose as an American surplus
account, but these reserve accounts rarely attain a comparable magnitude.
Plowing Back Due to Watered Stock.The American theory of “plow-
ing back” earnings appears to have grown out of the stock-watering prac-
tices of prewar days. Many of our large industrial companies made their
initial appearance with no tangible assets behind their common shares and
with inadequate protection for their preferred issues. Hence it was natural
that the management should seek to make good these deficiencies out of
subsequent earnings. This was particularly true because additional stock
could not be sold at its par value, and it was difficult therefore to obtain
new capital for expansion except through undistributed profits.
2
Examples: Concrete examples of the relation between overcapitaliza-
tion and dividend policies are afforded by the outstanding cases of Wool-
worth and United States Steel Corporation.
In the original sale of F . W . Woolworth Company shares to the pub-
lic, made in 1911, the company issued preferred stock to represent all the
tangible assets and common stock to represent the good-will. The bal-
ance sheet accordingly carried a good-will item of $50,000,000 among the
assets, offsetting a corresponding liability for 500,000 shares of common,
par $100.
3 As Woolworth prospered, a large surplus was built up out of

**[Page 436]**

earnings, and amounts were charged against this surplus to reduce the
good-will account, until finally it was written down to $1.4
In the case of United States Steel Corporation, the original capitaliza-
tion exceeded tangible assets by no less than $768,000,000, representing
all the common and more than half the preferred stock. This “water” in
the balance sheet was not shown as a good-will item, as in the case of
Woolworth, but was concealed by an overvaluation of the fixed assets (i.e.,
of the “Property Investment Accounts”). Through various accounting
methods, however, the management applied earnings from operations to
the writing off of these intangible or fictitious assets. By the end of 1929
a total of $508,000,000—equal to the entire original common-stock
issue—had been taken from earnings or surplus and deducted from the
property account. The balance of $260,000,000 was set up separately as
an intangible asset in the 1937 report and then written off entirely in 1938
by means of a reduction in the stated value of the common stock.
Some of the accounting policies above referred to will be discussed
again, with respect to their influence on investment values, in our chap-
ters on Analysis of the Income Account and Balance-sheet Analysis. From
the dividend standpoint it is clear that in both of these examples the deci-
sion to retain large amounts of earnings, instead of paying them out to
the stockholders, was due in part to the desire to eliminate intangible
items from the asset accounts.
Conclusions from the Foregoing. From the foregoing discussion
certain conclusions may be drawn. These bear, first on the very practical
question of what significance should be accorded the dividend rate as
compared with the reported earnings and, secondly, upon the more the-
oretical but exceedingly important question of what dividend policies
should be considered as most desirable from the standpoint of the stock-
holders’ interest.
Experience would confirm the established verdict of the stock market
that a dollar of earnings is worth more to the stockholder if paid him in
dividends than when carried to surplus. The common-stock investor
should ordinarily require both an adequate earning power and an adequate
[384] SECURITY ANALYSIS
4 It should be noted that when the good-will of Woolworth was originally listed in the bal-
ance sheet at $50,000,000, its actual value (as measured by the market price of the shares)
was only some $20,000,000. But when the good-will was written down to $1, in 1925, its real
value was apparently many times $50,000,000.

dividend. If the dividend is disproportionately small, an investment pur-
chase will be justified only on an exceptionally impressive showing of earn-
ings (or by a very special situation with respect to liquid assets). On the
other hand, of course, an extra-liberal dividend policy cannot compensate
for inadequate earnings, since with such a showing the dividend rate must
necessarily be undependable.
To aid in developing these ideas quantitatively, we submit the follow-
ing definitions:
The dividend rate is the amount of annual dividends paid per share,
expressed either in dollars or as a percentage of a $100 par value. (If the
par value is less than $100, it is inadvisable to refer to the dividend rate
as a percentage figure since this may lead to confusion.)
The earnings rate is the amount of annual earnings per share, expressed
either in dollars or as a percentage of a $100 par value.
The dividend ratio, dividend return or dividend yield, is the ratio of the
dividend paid to the market price ( e.g., a stock paying $6 annually and
selling at 120 has a dividend ratio of 5%).
The earnings ratio, earnings return or earnings yield, is the ratio of the
annual earnings to the market price (e.g., a stock earning $6 and selling
at 50 shows an earnings yield of 12%).
5
Let us assume that a common stock A, with average prospects, earn-
ing $7 and paying $5 should sell at 100. This is a 7% earnings ratio and
5% dividend return. Then a smilar common stock, B, earning $7 but pay-
ing only $4, should sell lower than 100. Its price evidently should be
somewhere between 80 (representing a 5% dividend yield) and 100 (rep-
resenting a 7% earnings yield). In general the price should tend to be
established nearer to the lower limit than to the upper limit. A fair
approximation of the proper relative price would be about 90, at which
level the dividend yield is 4.44%, and the earnings ratio is 7.78%. If the
investor makes a small concession in dividend yield below the standard,
he is entitled to demand a more than corresponding increase in the earn-
ing power above standard.
In the opposite case a similar stock, C, may earn $7 but pay $6. Here
the investor is justified in paying some premium above 100 because of

basis is ambiguous, since it is used sometimes to denote the rate and sometimes the ratio.

the larger dividend. The upper limit, of course, would be 120 at which
price the dividend ratio would be the standard 5%, but the earnings ratio
would be only 5.83%. Here again the proper price should be closer to the
lower than to the upper limit, say, 108, at which figure the dividend yield
would be 5.56% and the earnings ratio 6.48%.
Suggested Principle for Dividend Payments. Although these fig-
ures are arbitrarily taken, they correspond fairly well with the actualities
of investment values under what seem now to be reasonably normal con-
ditions in the stock market. The dividend rate is seen to be important,
apart from the earnings, not only because the investor naturally wants
cash income from his capital but also because the earnings that are not
paid out in dividends have a tendency to lose part of their effective value
for the stockholder. Because of this fact American shareholders would do
well to adopt a different attitude than hitherto with respect to corporate
dividend policies. We should suggest the following principle as a desir-
able modification of the traditional viewpoint:
Principle: Stockholders are entitled to receive the earnings on their
capital except to the extent they decide to reinvest them in the business.
The management should retain or reinvest earnings only with the spe-
cific approval of the stockholders. Such “earnings” as must be retained to
protect the company’s position are not true earnings at all. They should
not be reported as profits but should be deducted in the income state-
ment as necessary reserves, with an adequate explanation thereof. A com-
pulsory surplus is an imaginary surplus.
6
Were this principle to be generally accepted, the withholding of earn-
ings would not be taken as a matter of course and of arbitrary determina-
tion by the management, but it would require justification corresponding
to that now expected in the case of changes in capitalization and of the
sale of additional stock. The result would be to subject dividend policies
to greater scrutiny and more intelligent criticism than they now receive,
thus imposing a salutary check upon the tendency of managements to
expand unwisely and to accumulate excessive working capital.

Theory of Common-stock Investment. The Dividend Factor [387]
If it should become the standard policy to disburse the major portion
of each year’s earnings (as is done abroad), then the rate of dividend will
vary with business conditions. This would apparently introduce an added
factor of instability into stock values. But the objection to the present
practice is that it fails to produce the stable dividend rate which is its
avowed purpose and the justification for the sacrifice it imposes. Hence
instead of a dependable dividend that mitigates the uncertainty of earn-
ings we have a frequently arbitrary and unaccountable dividend policy
that aggravates the earnings hazard. The sensible remedy would be to
transfer to the stockholder the task of averaging out his own annual
income return. Since the common-stock investor must form some fairly
satisfactory opinion of average earning power, which transcends the
annual fluctuations, he may as readily accustom himself to forming a sim-
ilar idea of average income. As in fact the two ideas are substantially iden-
tical, dividend fluctuations of this kind would not make matters more
difficult for the common-stock investor. In the end such fluctuations will
work out more to his advantage than the present method of attempting,
usually unsuccessfully, to stabilize the dividend by large additions to the
surplus account.
8 On the former basis, the stockholder’s average income
would probably be considerably larger.
A Paradox. Although we have concluded that the payment of a lib-
eral portion of the earnings in dividends adds definitely to the attractive-

involves a curious paradox. Value is increased by taking away value. The
more the stockholder subtracts in dividends from the capital and surplus
fund the larger value he places upon what is left. It is like the famous leg-
end of the Sibylline Books, except that here the price of the remainder is
increased because part has been taken away.
approval of a rate greater than that recommended by the directors. Despite the latter proviso,
the mere fact that the dividend policy is submitted to the stockholders for their specific
approval or criticism carries an exceedingly valuable reminder to the management of its
responsibilities, and to the owners of their rights, on this important question.
Although this procedure is not required by the Companies Act in all cases, it is generally
followed in England. See Companies Act of 1929, Sections 6–10; Table A to the Companies
Act of 1929, pars. 89–93; Palmer’s Company Law, pp. 222–224, 13th ed., 1929.

It is to be noted that because Atchison failed to increase its dividend
the market price of the shares failed to reflect adequately the large
increase both in earning power and in book value. The more liberal div-
idend policy of Union Pacific produced the opposite result.
This anomaly of the stock market is explained in good part by the
underlying conflict of the two prevailing ideas regarding dividends which
we have discussed in this chapter. In the following brief summary of the
situation we endeavor to indicate the relation between the theoretical and
the practical aspects of the dividend question.

**[Page 441]**

Theory of Common-stock Investment. The Dividend Factor [389]
Summary
1. In some cases the stockholders derive positive benefits from an
ultraconservative dividend policy, i.e., through much larger eventual
earnings and dividends. In such instances the market’s judgment proves
to be wrong in penalizing the shares because of their small dividend. The
price of these shares should be higher rather than lower on account of the
fact that profits have been added to surplus instead of having been paid
out in dividends.
2. Far more frequently, however, the stockholders derive much greater
benefits from dividend payments than from additions to surplus. This
happens because either: (a) the reinvested profits fail to add proportion-
ately to the earning power or ( b) they are not true “profits” at all but
reserves that had to be retained merely to protect the business. In this
majority of cases the market’s disposition to emphasize the dividend and
to ignore the additions to surplus turns out to be sound.
3. The confusion of thought arises from the fact that the stockholder
votes in accordance with the first premise and invests on the basis of the
second. If the stockholders asserted themselves intelligently, this paradox
would tend to disappear. For in that case the withholding of a large per-
centage of the earnings would become an exceptional practice, subject to
close scrutiny by the stockholders and presumably approved by them
from a considered conviction that such retention would be beneficial to
the owners of the shares. Such a ceremonious endorsement of a low div-
idend rate would probably and properly dispel the stock market’s scepti-
cism on this point and permit the price to reflect the earnings that are
accumulating as well as those which were paid out.
The foregoing discussion may appear to conflict with the suggestion,
advanced in the previous chapter, that long-term increases in common-
stock values are often due to the reinvestment of undistributed profits.
We must distinguish here between the two lines of argument. Taking our
standard case of a company earning $10 per share and paying dividends
of $7, we have pointed out that the repeated annual additions of $3 per
share to surplus should serve to increase the value of the stock over a
period of years. This may very well be true, and at the same time the rate
of increase in value may be substantially less than $3 per annum com-
pounded. If we take the reverse case, viz., $3 paid in dividends and $7

---
**[Page 442]**

added to surplus, the distinction is clearer. Undoubtedly the large addi-
tion to surplus will expand the value of the stock, but quite probably also
this value will fail to increase at the annual rate of $7 compounded. Hence
the argument against reinvesting large proportions of the yearly earnings
would remain perfectly valid. Our criticism is advanced against the 
latter type of policy, e.g., the retention of 70% of the earnings, and not
against the normal reinvestment of some 30% of the profits.
Dividend Policies since 1934. If the dividend practice of American
corporations were to be judged solely by the record during 1934–1939,
the criticism expressed in this chapter would have to be softened consid-
erably. In these recent years there has been a definite tendency towards
greater liberality in dividend payments, particularly by companies that
do not have clearly defined opportunities for profitable expansion. Reten-
tion of earnings by rapidly growing enterprises, e.g. , airplane manufac-
turers, is hardly open to objection. Since the end of 1932, on the other
hand, General Motors Corporation has disbursed about 80% of earnings
to common-stock holders, with no wide deviation in any year through
1939. In 1939 the Treasury Department announced that it would use 70%
as a rough or preliminary test to decide whether or not a company is sub-
ject to the penalty taxes for improper accumulation of surplus.
As far as stock prices are concerned, it can hardly be said that they
have been unduly influenced by arbitrary dividend policies in these recent
years. For not only have the policies themselves been far less arbitrary
than in former times, but there has been a definite tendency in the stock
market to subordinate the dividend factor to the reported and prospec-
tive earnings.
The Undistributed-profits Tax.The more liberal dividends of recent
years have been due in part to the highly controversial tax on undistrib-
uted profits. This was imposed by Congress in 1936, on a graduated scale
running from 7 to 27%. Following violent criticism, the tax was reduced
to a vestigial 2
1/2% in 1938 and repealed entirely the following year. Its
main object was to compel companies to distribute their earnings, so that
they might be subject to personal income taxes levied against the stock-
holders. A secondary objective appears to have been to restrict the accu-
mulation of corporate surpluses, which were thought by some to be
injurious, either because they withheld purchasing power from individ-
uals or because they were conducive to unwise expansion. But the tax was
[390] SECURITY ANALYSIS

widely and violently condemned, chiefly on the ground that it prevented
the creation of surplus or reserve funds essential to meet future losses or
emergencies or expansion needs. It was said to lay a heavy penalty on 
corporate thrift and prudence and to bear with particular severity on
small or new corporations which must rely largely on retained profits for
their growth.
Law Objectionable but Criticized on Wrong Grounds. In our own
opinion the law was a very bad one, but it has been criticized largely on
the wrong grounds. Its objective, as first announced, was to tax corpora-
tions exactly as if they were partnerships and hence to equalize the taxa-
tion basis of corporate and unincorporated businesses. Much could be
said in favor of this aim. But as the bill was finally passed it effectively
superposed partnership taxation on top of corporate taxation, thus heav-
ily discriminating against the corporate form and especially against small
stockholders. Nor was it a practicable tax as far as wealthy holders were
concerned, because the extremely high personal tax rates, combined with
the corporation taxes (state and federal), created an over-all burden
undoubtedly hostile to individual initiative. Fully as bad were the techni-
cal details of the tax law, which compelled distributions in excess of actual
accounting profits, disregarded very real capital losses and allowed no
flexibility in the treatment of inventory values.
Despite the almost universal opinion to the contrary, we do not believe
that the undistributed profits tax really prevented the reinvestment of
earnings, except to the extent that these were diminished by personal
income taxes—as they would be in an unincorporated business. Corpo-
rations had available a number of methods for retaining or recovering
these earnings, without subjecting them to the penalty tax. These devices
included (1) declaration of taxable stock dividends (e.g. , in preferred
stock); (2) payment of “optional” dividends, so contrived as to impel the
stockholders to take stock rather than cash; (3) offering of additional stock
on attractive terms at the time of payment of cash dividends. Critics of the
tax have asserted that these methods are inconvenient or impracticable.
Our own observation is that they were quite practicable and were resorted
to by a fair number of corporations in 1936 and 1937,
9 but that they were

avoided by the majority, either from unfamiliarity or from a desire to
throw as harsh a light as possible upon the law.

expressed as to whether or not stockholders are really benefited by 
dividend-withholding policies, we may be thought sympathetic to the
idea of preventing reinvestment of profits by imposing penalty taxes
thereon. This is far from true. Dividend and reinvestment policies should
be controlled not by law but by the intelligent decision of stockholders.
Individual cases may well justify retention of earnings to an extent far
greater than is ordinarily desirable. The practice should vary with the 
circumstances; the policy should be determined and proposed in the 
first instance by the management; but it should be subject to independ-
ent consideration and appraisal by stockholders in their own interest, as
distinguished from that of the corporation as a separate entity or the man-
agement as a special group.

Introduction to Part V
THE QUEST FOR R ATIONAL INVESTING
BY GLENN H. G REENBERG
T
rue confession: I never read Security Analysis while at Columbia
Business School. Never even took a securities analysis course.
Instead, some invisible hand guided me into stock research and
later money management, where I have labored for the past 33 years. It
wasn’t until perhaps the middle of my investment career that I decided it
was time to pick up Graham and Dodd and see what all the buzz was
about. The first 300 pages dealt with fixed income securities, which I have
seldom owned and were of little interest to me. The equity section
seemed dated: topics such as determining the earnings power of indus-
trial cyclicals and the appropriate depreciation of utility plant and equip-
ment conjured up sepia-tone images of a bygone era. I was running my
own investment business and in need of immediate investment ideas.
Could this book help me find my next winner? Not likely, I decided. So
imagine my reaction years later when an editor from McGraw-Hill called
to ask me to write this introduction. After a long, long silence I asked if he
could send me a copy.
Rereading Graham and Dodd felt a little bit like reading Polonius’s
charge to his son in Hamlet as he departs to pursue his studies abroad
(“neither a borrower nor a lender be” and “to thine own self be true”). Yes,
the advice was sound, but it seemed so obvious. In Part V, we are coun-
seled against placing too much emphasis on near-term earnings and
warned not to trust unscrupulous management. We are cautioned about

manipulation of financial statements and urged to appreciate the qualita-
tive aspects of a business we invest in. A bright line is drawn for us sepa-
rating speculation from investment. The appropriate level of debt in the
capital structure, how to think about commodity-based investments, and
the manic-depressive nature of markets are all addressed—well of course
these ideas sound familiar because they have been interwoven through
so many annual letters by Warren Buffett and cited by other great
investors who credit Graham and Dodd for some portion of their invest-
ment success. As implied by the title of this part, Graham and Dodd do
present detailed discussion and analysis of the income statement
accounts, but it is the more general investment precepts that I and others
treasure. This work is the more remarkable because it was written during
the uniquely depressed circumstances of 1934, a nation of 25% unem-
ployment with most businesses struggling to survive. Yet Graham and
Dodd were able to codify the principles that have inspired great investors
through 75 years of remarkable prosperity. Their insights are as applica-
ble now as ever.
The purpose of Part V is to explore analysis of the income accounts in
order to estimate the earnings power of the business and thereby deter-
mine if the stock is undervalued. There is no magic formula for this task:
the future may resemble the past—or it may not! Virtually every page of
this part is filled with useful analysis of company financials and great clar-
ity of thought on a wide variety of industries. Financial analysis, not the
CEO’s letter, is key to assessing a business. There is a total absence of
terms like “story, ” “concept, ” “paradigm, ” or “trend” to justify an invest-
ment. We all want to buy low and sell high, but first we must develop
confidence in the sustainability of a business in order to arrive at a sound
judgment about what constitutes “low” and “high. ”
Estimating average future earnings is not easy. In the 1930s there was
tremendous volatility in earnings because of the operating leverage inher-

ent in manufacturing and resource businesses. The challenge in determin-
ing earnings power in today’s more stable economy is different but no less
daunting. There are global competitors and disruptive new technologies.
Financial companies have developed extraordinary new products, which
have been profitable to date but now face testing. Technology firms have
to constantly reinvent themselves. Even the most stable businesses may
surprise. I recall visiting Coca-Cola in late 1993. It was generally hailed as
the finest business in the world because of its pricing power and bound-
less international growth opportunities. Valued at 18 times earnings, it
was a bargain provided that earnings could grow over 15% annually for
an extended period of time. It never occurred to anyone that this incredi-
ble franchise would have flattish earnings from 1996 through 2002.
How We Invest
At my firm, Chieftain Capital Management, we evaluate an investment
opportunity based on the predictability of the business and a dispassion-
ate calculation of its expected rate of return. We read all of a company’s
public filings, we analyze its industry and competitors (of which, ideally,
there should not be many), we talk to its management team and industry
experts, and we gather any other relevant data we can find, distilling it all
into a historical analysis of the performance of the business. Obvious
questions arise: Can margins continue to rise? Is the business becoming
more capital intensive? Why are sales slowing? And so on. This analysis
becomes the basis for further discussions with management and ulti-
mately our projections of future results.
We and other investors today tend to focus on cash flow after capital
expenditures (free cash flow), instead of earnings, to evaluate the invest-
ment merits of a business. One advantage of this approach is that it helps
shortcut a good many games that management can play in reporting
profits. Moreover, earnings are seldom synonymous with cash available

for shareholders, and it is the latter that should matter to investors. It has
always struck me as curious that the first questions asked by a private
investor are, how much money must I put up, how much cash will I get
back, and how fast? Why should investors in publicly traded stocks ask
different questions?
Finally, we calculate the rate of return implied by the free cash flows
we expect the business to generate, in perpetuity, taking into account
the investments the company needs to make to continue its growth. We
generally will not buy a stock unless it is priced to give us at least a 15%
rate of return. Obviously, there is much judgment involved in determin-
ing such a hurdle rate, and it must be refined to reflect the quality of the
business and expected returns from alternative investment opportunities.
In 1974 our investment hurdle would have been much higher—perhaps
25%—because there were so many undervalued stocks to choose from
and interest rates were higher. By insisting on a very high rate of return,
compared to the high-single-digit return we calculate to be offered by
the broader market, we give ourselves significant margin for error. Our
goal is to set the bar very high knowing that there will be few times
when we find a great business selling at a price that will also give us a
great rate of return. We seldom find a stock meeting these criteria, so
when we do, we build a large position: never less than 5% of our assets
and often as much as 25%. We sell a stock when the return in our model
drops to 10%—even though our alternative may be cash earning less
than 5%. At all times we are mindful that our approach is only as good as
our assumptions about the future, and small changes in our assumptions,
such as the growth rate of cash flows over the long term, can dramati-
cally alter prospective returns.
A recent reminder of the importance of assumptions is a purchase we
made in early 2007 of Ryanair, the world’s largest airline as measured by
passengers. The Irish company sports by far the lowest fares of anyone in
[398] Introduction to Part V

---
**[Page 451]**

Glenn H. Greenberg [399]
the short-haul business in the European markets it serves. In 10 years, it
has grown its passengers tenfold and yet it has only a 7% share of the
market. Last year its average fare was 44 euros, which compares with 66
euros for easyJet, 91 for Aer Lingus, and well over 100 euros for all the
flag carriers. Even so, Ryanair has averaged 20% net margins over the
past decade, versus low single digits for its rivals. We paid 16 times the
current year’s earnings estimates and felt this price was justified by
Ryanair’s huge cost advantages and growth prospects. Then the price of
oil doubled again. The shares have declined 30% since our initial invest-
ment, and the profit outlook has dimmed.
Still, the business franchise is intact. Nothing has happened that
makes us believe the long-term value of our investment has diminished.
In fact, during this period of adversity, other low-cost carriers are
expected to cease operations. Lenders are likely to be cautious in funding
possible new entrants, and consumers may wish to trade down to take
advantage of Ryanair’s low fares. Over time, a company with this kind of
cost advantage must take market share and earn attractive returns.
The process I have just described is our attempt to cover the bases
outlined by the authors of Security Analysis. For Graham and Dodd, step 1
is careful quantitative analysis with particular attention to identifying real,
not accounting, earnings. Accounting has always presented management
with opportunities to misrepresent results. In 1934, companies ran nonre-
curring gains through the profit-and-loss statement and stretched out
depreciation schedules to make earnings look better than they were.
Managers would charge certain losses directly to shareholders’ equity,
bypassing (and inflating) net income in the process. In addition to earn-
ings, Graham and Dodd were also attuned to the importance of free cash
flow, as in their discussion of the Eureka Pipe Line (Chapter 36 on accom-
panying CD). Just as Graham and Dodd illustratively juxtapose the per-
spectives of the private businessperson and the public investor, my

[400] Introduction to Part V
partners and I often ask ourselves the question: If this were a private
business, how would we measure its value?
Accounting Challenges
Today, the accounting challenges for the investor are far more difficult. The
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued any number of
accounting mandates that muddy the waters. For example, while I certainly
oppose excessive granting of stock options to management and employ-
ees, there are numerous difficulties in accounting for them as a current
expense as prescribed by the recent FASB statement 123R. First off, stock
options are a noncash obligation and may never cost the shareholder a
penny—but under 123R even a deeply out-of-the-money option will still
result in an expense years after being awarded to an employee. Second,
stock options are already reflected in the diluted share base used to calcu-
late the earnings-per-share (EPS) figures most investors focus on; by further
burdening net income with an expense for options, diluted EPS under
today’s accounting clearly reflects double counting. Finally, valuing options
requires numerous assumptions and thus opens the door to manipulation.
By the way, the previous approach to accounting for stock options was
even odder: options granted with a strike price equal to the market price
had no expense impact, but those granted below market would, in some
cases, result in an expense every year thereafter that the underlying stock
rose. There is equal confusion to be found in the FASB approach to
accounting for derivatives, hedging, pensions, leases, and recognition of
profits for carried interests, to name a few. Now companies can even record
a profit if their debt gets downgraded. Sometimes accounting rules seem
designed to carry us very far from economic reality, and some managers
are quite amenable to taking investors on such a journey.
Having analyzed the historical record, the second and far greater chal-
lenge is to determine “the utility of this past record as an indication of

---
**[Page 453]**

future earnings. ” Graham and Dodd call it a “qualitative survey of the
enterprise. ” Is the future of the business adequately predictable so as to
permit a long-term investment? Is the business growing so rapidly as to
attract numerous competitors? Is it subject to being undermined by a
new technology or changing consumer taste? Will it be squashed by
imports or Wal-Mart or by a business model enabled by the Internet? In
other words, how predictable are future cash flows? And how do we feel
about the corporate culture and management leadership? Can they be
relied on to be shrewd, rational, and motivated to maximize the value of
our investment? Or do they have a different agenda? Will management
itself follow the Graham and Dodd principles in investing the sharehold-
ers’ money?
Whose Company Is It?
This last point is particularly important. Often managers get confused
and believe that it is their company, which they can run to satisfy their
personal needs—and few such managers would acknowledge that this
applies to them. We spend a lot of time getting to know the stewards
of the companies in which we invest to ascertain their personal priori-
ties. Small observations can sometimes provide a clue. A CEO who
won’t answer tough questions directly is a warning sign. A deeply
tanned CEO wearing a lot of gold jewelry is not likely to be someone
we feel we can trust. 
Worse yet is a CEO who undervalues his stock by offering it in
exchange for shares of a company with less attractive business prospects
than his own. This happened in 2004 when Comcast CEO Brian Roberts
made a surprise offer to purchase Disney in an all-stock deal that would
have been hugely dilutive to free cash flow and would have radically
changed the nature of the company. Clearly the motivation of the man-
agement was to build an empire by owning an American icon rather
Glenn H. Greenberg [401]

---
**[Page 454]**

than to build the value of its own business, on a per share basis, for the
investors. We sold a large portion of our Comcast shares upon learning of
the offer. Worried about dilution of the value of the company, others did
the same, driving down the stock price by over 20%. Roberts subse-
quently withdrew the Disney offer since he no longer had a sufficiently
valuable stock with which to make the acquisition.
Similarly, it can be disheartening to discuss the concept of share
repurchases with some managers. If we ask whether the cash return on a
capital project is as good as the return from buying back stock, they gen-
erally look at us as though we’re speaking in a foreign tongue.
This qualitative assessment allows the discriminating investor to sin-
gle out truly good businesses. Few investors active today lived as I did
through the bear market of 1973 to 1974 or the crash of 1987, when the
market lost 30% of its value in only a few days. As I watched the disasters
around me, I made a promise to myself to avoid any stock that I would
not feel comfortable holding through another 1987-like crash. The reason
is simple: in the aftermath of a collapse, much wealth has evaporated
and confidence is circling the drain. Wild rumors are flying—and many
may just be true. Without confidence in the staying power of a business,
the overwhelming tendency is simply to follow the crowd and sell. Many
who do sell are so shell-shocked that they are afraid to buy again until
well after a recovery has occurred. Trading on emotions is nearly always
the wrong thing to do, especially for those investors who have carefully
done their homework. Certainly a good business can hit a rough patch,
but it is not unusual for such a business to regain its footing. Sometimes
huge stock declines occur for no apparent reason.
I recall that shortly after making a new investment in LabCorp in
August 2002, the company reported quarterly earnings that were 6% shy
of Street estimates. The stock, for which we had paid $34, or 12 times the
next year’s free cash flow, fell as low as $18 in October 2002. Of course,
[402] Introduction to Part V

---
**[Page 455]**

we were horrified at the sudden loss, but after checking our research and
confirming our understanding of the favorable characteristics of the busi-
ness, we tripled our position at what proved to be bargain prices. At $18,
the stock was trading at less than 7 times expected free cash flow.
LabCorp met all our definitions for an outstanding business. It was
very profitable and had low capital requirements. The industry had con-
solidated from seven national competitors to two with only modest
regional overlap, LabCorp being one of them. More importantly, it was
difficult to enter the business because of the third-party medical pay-
ment system that we have in our country. A new entrant would have
trouble getting reimbursed by health insurance companies, which want
to send business to only the lowest-cost labs. LabCorp has continued to
prosper due in part to the aging of the population, and it is now on the
cusp of benefiting from the introduction of early cancer detection blood
tests, such as one for ovarian cancer. All of this leads to the question of
why it collapsed in the fall of 2002. Who knows? But only through careful
research can one develop the confidence to take advantage of such a
bargain.
After completing the quantitative and qualitative analyses, Graham
and Dodd address the issue of valuation. They emphasize the importance
of looking at average earnings, so as not to be misled by a recent year of
abnormal performance, and of applying a conservative valuation multi-
ple to such earnings. The authors admit that money can be made buying
a stock with a high price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple but that such an
investment must be deemed “speculative”—a gamble no different from a
bet on a commodity future or a roll of the dice. A successful speculation
is simply luck, and few investors are lucky for long. Probably the most
important principle from this book is that stock investing is a risky busi-
ness. The future is unknowable. Not only are earnings subject to many
uncertainties, but P/E multiples can change drastically based on uncon-
Glenn H. Greenberg [403]

trollable factors such as interest rates, investor sentiment, or government
actions. Foreign investing can be particularly speculative. While the
growth in developing countries is faster than in our own, there are seri-
ous imponderables: Will regulations change in a way that handicaps the
foreign investor? What are the chances the business will be nationalized?
Will a contract with a foreign government be honored? And there are
more mundane risks such as currency fluctuations, the accuracy of local
accounting practices, and management corruption.
A Daunting Challenge
If Graham and Dodd are so widely read and respected, why are there so
few disciplined practitioners of their advice? I believe the answer lies in
three human traits: aversion to boredom, a tendency for emotions to
overwhelm reason, and greed. Careful research takes time and seldom
results in a clear case for buying a large position. It is tedious to review
company after company, only to find that most are neither really special
nor greatly undervalued. It is equally tedious to hold shares in a good
company for an extended period. Even if the investment does well, most
of the time it feels like the stock is treading water or even going down.
Part of the problem is that the value of the business is quoted 6
1⁄2 hours
a day, 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year, and market liquidity tempts us to
trade from one stock to another.
The second challenge to rational investing is to maintain one’s logical
convictions in the face of excess gloom or euphoria as reflected in stock
prices. I doubt many owners of pr ivate companies are preoccupied with
the value of their business on a short-term basis—how different from the
public markets, where a rising stock price makes us feel smart and a
falling one makes us feel dumb. In my office, when one of our businesses
is floundering and the stock is getting pounded, my partners and I start
to doubt the reasoned basis upon which we made the investment. Our
[404] Introduction to Part V

**[Page 457]**

self-doubts and fears of failure cause us to glimpse catastrophe where
once we envisioned opportunity. Or if you prefer the Graham and Dodd
condensed version: “Obviously it requires strength of character in order
to think and act in opposite fashion from the crowd and also patience to
wait for opportunities that may be spaced years apart. ”
The third factor, greed, has always distorted investors’ behavior, but it
is especially present in markets today given the proliferation of hedge
funds. Investors in these funds keep jumping from fund to fund, trying
to latch on to the latest hot manager. The high fees encourage these
managers to pursue “get-rich-quick” trading strategies. The more money
they make, the more money they attract, and investors have been sold
on the promise of unsustainably high returns. A cycle ensues as hedge
fund investors quickly move their money from fund to fund, and hedge
fund managers try to swing for the fences every month. I once attended
the U.S. Open and sat near two hedge fund managers whom I did not
know. They were talking shop during the match, and much to my sur-
prise, their discussion focused exclusively on assets under management
and fees. I kept waiting for them to mention an investment idea, but it
never happened.
Today the crowd focuses on isolated data points, the latest wiggles in
the business outlook, or the opinion expressed in the most recent
research report. With so much information available, there is a tendency
to act too quickly to buy and sell in haste, and to substitute the views of
others for the hard work necessary to come to one’s own conclusions.
Perhaps this is why so many market participants can be described only as
“traders” and “speculators, ” unafraid of using debt to turbocharge returns.
Their method requires frequent profitable trades, after transaction costs,
and incurs far higher taxes than the long-term investor pays. They also
pay a heavy price in terms of emotional wear and tear. It is easy to vaca-
tion or enjoy family if one owns great businesses—and it’s impossible if
Glenn H. Greenberg [405]

one is tracking a flock of trading positions about which one has little con-
viction. Most importantly, a fast-moving, leveraged approach is likely to
fail spectacularly at some point over a lifetime, which is an unacceptable
risk for those of us who invest our own money alongside our clients’ .
Few investors these days seem to take the time to truly understand
the quality and motivation of top management. This book clearly empha-
sizes the importance of unflinching intellectual honesty on the part of an
investor while preparing an analysis—matched by similar integrity in the
management of the enterprise in which the investor places client capital.
Slick managers, who always have an infallible business plan and dismiss
all past mistakes as nonrecurring anomalies, will do everything they can
to prevent you from peering behind Oz’s curtain to see the true outlook
for the business.
A recurring theme of Security Analysis is the importance of gathering
as much information as possible, but then making judgments, which are
subject to being wildly off the mark. One will not find any claims of a
“surefire” way to pick stocks. There is recognition that even the most
exhaustive analysis can fail to bring investment success. Graham and
Dodd don’t make security analysis seem easy or a guarantee of profits.
During my initial reading of the book many years ago, I wish I had
digested the short preface to the first edition: “We are concerned chiefly
with concepts, methods, standards, principles and, above all, with logical
reasoning. ” The authors were not trying to write “Investing for Dummies”
or a chronicle of stock tips. They were trying to help the thoughtful
investor develop a successful approach to long-term wealth creation
“which will stand the test of the ever enigmatic future. ” I have come to
believe that it may require a bit of experience on the part of the reader to
fully appreciate the power of this book to remain relevant. Perhaps this
wisdom, like youth, is wasted on the young.
Another fascinating element of Part V is the discussion of optimal
capital structure, because it speaks to the current media frenzy over pri-
[406] Introduction to Part V

---
**[Page 459]**

vate equity investors. First prevalent in the 1980s and more dramatically
today, investment groups have applied leverage in order to enhance
equity returns in taking companies private. The book refers to such lev-
ered, option-like-equity holders as having a situation in which “heads I
win, tails you lose. ” This seems particularly apt for the general partners of
today’s private equity firms. Indeed, high leverage can lead to outsized
returns, but it is another form of speculation, much like buying stock at a
very high P/E ratio. 
I will presume a little to imagine how Graham and Dodd would analyze
the likely investment results for those limited partners only now allocating
huge sums to the private equity “megafunds. ” Pioneering institutional
investors in private equity funds blazed the alternative investment trail 20
years ago. Now that Yale’s investment approach and success are widely cel-
ebrated, endowment and state retirement fund managers want to join a
party that is close to ending. Buyout prices have never been higher, strate-
gic buyers are regularly outbid by ravenous financial buyers, and remain-
ing opportunities for operational improvement are few. Expected returns,
in short, are driven almost solely by maximizing leverage. With many buy-
outs thus priced and levered for only clear skies and smooth waters, a gen-
eral rise in interest rates or a business downturn could be disastrous. The
equity in these deals—that is, the limited partners’ capital—could easily be
wiped out. One wonders if the stewards of capital pouring money into pri-
vate equity today have any concept of the risks they are taking as fiduciar-
ies. Interestingly, the private equity firms themselves are going public at
generous valuations even though they have little permanent capital, the
lifeblood of their businesses. What if their limited partners are not satisfied
with results and don’t re-up? What is the correct P/E for a business model
facing such risk of destruction? Investment in these companies would
seem the very embodiment of the term “speculation. ”
Similarly, what would Graham and Dodd make of today’s collateral-
ized debt obligations that have been bought, not based on due

diligence but on the AAA rubber stamp from a credit rating agency? Or
lenders rushing to scoop up “covenant-light, ” “pay-in-kind” loans used in
90%-levered capital structures? Institutional appetite for hedge funds
and “2-and-20” fees? Investment theses built around ever-rising valua-
tions and continued “global liquidity”? There’s no need to wonder— Secu-
rity Analysis, timely as ever, has much to say on speculative excess.
Yes, we have heard this speech before: The stock market is a voting
machine, not a weighing machine. Future prices fall outside the realm of
sound prediction. Even the best companies can be speculations at the
wrong price. One must understand the nature of a business to assess the
inherent permanence of earning power. While it is easy to say, it is hard
to actually “buy low and sell high” because human nature programs us to
take comfort in the company of others. There is a distinction between
investment and speculation. Never invest with unscrupulous manage-
ment. Earnings must be understood in the absence of nonrecurring
items. Debt in the capital structure enhances returns, but there are limits.
The market shoots first and finds reasons later.
If it all seems self-evident, like Polonius’s speech, that’s because such
wisdom has stood the test of time and it has become part of our lexicon
as investors. Yet few people endeavor to walk the walk by researching
businesses intensively, sifting through many dozens to find those worthy
of their capital. Few people are willing to concentrate their investments
in a small number of businesses that they know thoroughly and believe
will grow their net worth at an attractive rate over the long term. Many
days this work is just plain boring. Other days (and sometimes months),
the market totally ignores your handful of precious stocks. A portfolio of
predictable, reliable businesses does not make you the most exciting per-
son at the cocktail party, nor does it give you flashy sales promotion
material. I have come to believe the quest for rational investing is appeal-
ing only to a handful of us. But at least we sleep well at night and live
well by day—and our clients do as well.

Chapter 31
ANALYSIS OF THE INCOME ACCOUNT
IN OUR HISTORICAL DISCUSSION of the theory of investment in common
stocks we traced the transfer of emphasis from the net worth of an enter-
prise to its capitalized earning power. Although there are sound and com-
pelling reasons behind this development, it is none the less one that has
removed much of the firm ground that formerly lay—or seemed to lie—
beneath investment analysis and has subjected it to a multiplicity of added
hazards. When an investor was able to take very much the same attitude
in valuing shares of stock as in valuing his own business, he was dealing
with concepts familiar to his individual experience and matured judgment.
Given sufficient information, he was not likely to go far astray, except per-
haps in his estimate of future earning power. The interrelations of balance
sheet and income statement gave him a double check on intrinsic values,
which corresponded to the formulas of banks or credit agencies in apprais-
ing the eligibility of the enterprise for credit.
Disadvantages of Sole Emphasis on Earning Power. Now that
common-stock values have come to depend exclusively upon the earn-
ings exhibit, a gulf has been created between the concepts of private busi-
ness and the guiding rules of investment. When the business man lays
down his own statement and picks up the report of a large corporation,
he apparently enters a new and entirely different world of values. For cer-
tainly he does not appraise his own business solely on the basis of its
recent operating results without reference to its financial resources. When
in his capacity as investor or speculator the business man elects to pay no
attention whatever to corporate balance sheets, he is placing himself at a
serious disadvantage in several different respects: In the first place, he is
embracing a new set of ideas that are alien to his everyday business expe-
rience. In the second place, instead of the twofold test of value afforded
[409]

**[Page 462]**

by both earnings and assets, he is relying upon a single and therefore less
dependable criterion. In the third place, these earnings statements on
which he relies exclusively are subject to more rapid and radical changes
than those which occur in balance sheets. Hence an exaggerated degree
of instability is introduced into his concept of stock values. In the fourth
place, the earnings statements are far more subject to misleading presen-
tation and mistaken inferences than is the typical balance sheet when
scrutinized by an investor of experience.
Warning against Sole Reliance upon Earnings Exhibit. In
approaching the analysis of earnings statements we must, therefore, utter
an emphatic warning against exclusive preoccupation with this factor in
dealing with investment values. With due recognition of the greatly
restricted importance of the asset picture, it must nevertheless be
asserted that a company’s resources still have some significance and
require some attention. This is particularly true, as will be seen later on,
because the meaning of any income statement cannot properly be under-
stood except with reference to the balance sheet at the beginning and the
end of the period.
Simplified Statement of Wall Street’s Method of Appraising
Common Stocks. Viewing the subject from another angle, we may say
that the Wall-Street method of appraising common stocks has been sim-
plified to the following standard formula:
1. Find out what the stock is earning. (This usually means the earn-
ings per share as shown in the last report.)
2. Multiply these per-share earnings by some suitable “coefficient of
quality” which will reflect:
a. The dividend rate and record.
b. The standing of the company—its size, reputation, financial position, and
prospects.
c. The type of business (e.g. , a cigarette manufacturer will sell at a higher
multiple of earnings than a cigar company).
d. The temper of the general market. (Bull-market multipliers are larger than
those used in bear markets.)
[410] SECURITY ANALYSIS

**[Page 463]**

Analysis of the Income Account [411]
The foregoing may be summarized in the following formula:
Price /H11005current earnings per share /H11003quality coefficient.1
The result of this procedure is that in most cases the “earnings per
share” have attained a weight in determining value that is equivalent to
the weight of all the other factors taken together. The truth of this is evi-
dent if it be remembered that the “quality coefficient” is itself largely
determined by the earnings trend, which in turn is taken from the stated
earnings over a period.
Earnings Not Only Fluctuate but Are Subject to Arbitrary
Determination. But these earnings per share, on which the entire edi-
fice of value has come to be built, are not only highly fluctuating but are
subject also in extraordinary degree to arbitrary determination and
manipulation. It will be illuminating if we summarize at this point the
various devices, legitimate and otherwise, by which the per-share earn-
ings may at the choice of those in control be made to appear either larger
or smaller.
1. By allocating items to surplus instead of to income, or vice versa.
2. By over-or understating amortization and other reserve charges.
3. By varying the capital structure, as between senior securities and
common stock. (Such moves are decided upon by managements and 
ratified by the stockholders as a matter of course.)
4. By the use made of large capital funds not employed in the conduct
of the business.
Significance of the Foregoing to the Analyst. These intricacies of
corporate accounting and financial policies undoubtedly provide a broad
field for the activities of the securities analyst. There are unbounded
opportunities for shrewd detective work, for critical comparisons, for 
discovering and pointing out a state of affairs quite different from that
indicated by the publicized “per-share earnings. ”
1 Where there are no earnings or where the amount is recognized as being far below 
“normal, ” Wall Street is reluctantly compelled to apply what is at bottom a more rational
method of valuation, i.e., one ascribing greater weight to average earning power, working
capital, etc. But this is the exceptional procedure.

**[Page 464]**

That this work may be of exceeding value cannot be denied. In a 
number of cases it will lead to a convincing conclusion that the market
price is far out of line with intrinsic or comparative worth and hence to
profitable action based upon this sound foundation. But it is necessary
to caution the analyst against overconfidence in the practical utility of his
findings. It is always good to know the truth, but it may not always be
wise to act upon it, particularly in Wall Street. And it must always be
remembered that the truth that the analyst uncovers is first of all not the
whole truth and, secondly, not the immutabletruth. The result of his study
is only a more nearly correct version of the past. His information may have
lost its relevance by the time he acquires it, or in any event by the time
the market place is finally ready to respond to it.
With full allowance for these pitfalls, it goes without saying, none the
less, that security analysis must devote thoroughgoing study to corporate
income accounts. It will aid our exposition if we classify this study under
three headings, viz.:
1. The accounting aspect. Leading question: What are the true earn-
ings for the period studied?
2. The business aspect. Leading question: What indications does the
earnings record carry as to the future earning power of the company?
3. The aspect of investment finance. Leading question: What elements
in the earnings exhibit must be taken into account, and what standards
followed, in endeavoring to arrive at a reasonable valuationof the shares?
CRITICISM AND RESTATEMENT OF 
THE INCOME ACCOUNT
If an income statement is to be informing in any true sense, it must at
least present a fair and undistorted picture of the year’s operating results.
Direct misstatement of the figures in the case of publicly owned compa-
nies is a rare occurrence. The Ivar Kreuger frauds, revealed in 1932, par-
took of this character, but these were quite unique in the baldness as well
as in the extent of the deception. The statements of most important com-
panies are audited by independent public accountants, and their reports
are reasonably dependable within the rather limited sphere of account-
ing accuracy.
2 But from the standpoint of common-stock analysis these

Analysis of the Income Account [413]
audited statements may require critical interpretation and adjustment,
especially with respect to three important elements:
1. Nonrecurrent profits and losses.
2. Operations of subsidiaries or affiliates.
3. Reserves.
General Observations on the Income Account.Accounting proce-
dure allows considerable leeway to the management in the method of treat-
ing nonrecurrent items. It is a standard and proper rule that transactions
applicable to past years should be excluded from current income and
entered as a charge or credit direct to the surplus account. Y et there are
many kinds of entries that may technically be considered part of the cur-
rent year’s results but that are none the less of a special and nonrecurrent
nature. Accounting rules permit the management to decide whether to
show these operations as part of the income or to report them as adjust-
ments of surplus. Following are a number of examples of entries of this type:
1. Profit or loss on sale of fixed assets.
2. Profit or loss on sale of marketable securities.
3. Discount or premium on retirement of capital obligations.
4. Proceeds of life insurance policies.
5. Tax refunds and interest thereon.
6. Gain or loss as result of litigation.
7. Extraordinary write-downs of inventory.
8. Extraordinary write-downs of receivables.
9. Cost of maintaining nonoperating properties.
Wide variations will be found in corporate practice respecting items
such as the foregoing. Under each heading examples may be given of
either inclusion in or exclusion from the income account. Which is the
better accounting procedure in some of these cases may be a rather con-
troversial question, but, as far as the analyst is concerned, his object
requires that all these items be segregated from the ordinary operating
results of the year. For what the investor chiefly wants to learn from 
an annual report is the indicated earning power under the given set of 
Company in 1938. (Interstate Hosiery Mills and Illinois Zinc Corporation are other examples
also uncovered in 1938.) Despite the sensational impression caused by the McKesson and
Robbins scandal, it must be recognized that over a long period of years only an infinitesimal
percentage of publicly owned companies have been involved in frauds of this character.

conditions, i.e., what the company might be expected to earn year after
year if the business conditions prevailing during the period were to con-
tinue unchanged. (On the other hand, as we shall point out later, all these
extraordinary items enter properly into the calculation of earning power
as actually shown over a period of years in the past.)
The analyst must endeavor also to adjust the reported earnings so as
to reflect as accurately as possible the company’s interest in results of con-
trolled or affiliated companies. In most cases consolidated reports are
made, so that such adjustments are unnecessary. But numerous instances
have occurred in which the statements are incomplete or misleading
because either: (1) they fail to reflect any part of the profits or losses of
important subsidiaries or (2) they include as income dividends from sub-
sidiaries that are substantially less or greater than the current earnings of
the controlled enterprises.
The third aspect of the income account to which the analyst must give
critical attention is the matter of reserves for depreciation and other
amortization, and reserves for future losses and other contingencies.
These reserves are subject in good part to arbitrary determination by the
management. Hence they may readily be overstated or understated, in
which case the final figure of reported earnings will be correspondingly
distorted. With respect to amortization charges, another and more sub-
tle element enters which may at times be of considerable importance, and
that is the fact that the deductions from income, as calculated by the man-
agement based on the book cost of the property, may not properly reflect
the amortization that the individual investor should charge against his
own commitment in the enterprise.
Nonrecurrent Items: Profits or Losses from Sale of Fixed
Assets. We shall proceed to a more detailed discussion of these three
types of adjustment of the reported income account, beginning with the
subject of nonrecurrent items. 3 Profits or losses from the sale of fixed
assets belong quite obviously to this category, and they should be
[414] SECURITY ANALYSIS
3 The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 specifically empower
the Commission to prescribe the methods to be followed in differentiating between recur-
rent and nonrecurrent items in the reports of registered companies which must be filed with
the S.E.C. and with the exchanges [Sec. 19(a) of the 1933 act and Sec. 13(b) of the 1934 act].
The initial registration forms (A-1, A-2 and 10) and the annual report form (10-K) require
separation of nonrecurrent profit-and-loss items within the income account.

excluded from the year’s result in order to gain an idea of the “indicated
earning power” based on the assumed continuance of the business con-
ditions existing then. Approved accounting practice recommends that
profit on sales of capital assets be shown only as a credit to the surplus
account. In numerous instances, however, such profits are reported by
the company as part of its current net income, creating a distorted pic-
ture of the earnings for the period.
Examples:A glaring example of this practice is presented by the report
of the Manhattan Electrical Supply Company for 1926. This showed earn-
ings of $882,000, or $10.25 per share, which was regarded as a very favor-
able exhibit. But a subsequent application to list additional shares on the
New Y ork Stock Exchange revealed that out of this $882,000 reported as
earned, no less than $586,700 had been realized through the sale of the
company’s battery business. Hence the earnings from ordinary operations
were only $295,300, or about $3.40 per share. The inclusion of this spe-
cial profit in income was particularly objectionable because in the very
same year the company had charged to surplus extraordinary losses
amounting to $544,000. Obviously the special losses belonged to the same
category as the special profits, and the two items should have been
grouped together. The effect of including the one in income and charg-
ing the other to surplus was misleading in the highest degree. Still more
discreditable was the failure to make any clear reference to the profit from
the battery sale either in the income account itself or in the extended
remarks that accompanied it in the annual report.
4
During 1931 the United States Steel Corporation reported “special
income” of some $19,300,000, the greater part of which was due to “profit
on sale of fixed property”—understood to be certain public-utility hold-
ings in Gary, Indiana. This item was included in the year’s earnings and
resulted in a final “net income” of $13,000,000. But since this credit was
definitely of a nonrecurring nature, the analyst would be compelled to elim-
inate it from his consideration of the 1931 operating results, which would
accordingly register a loss of $6,300,000 before preferred dividends. United
States Steel’s accounting method in 1931 is at variance with its previous

several years of unprofitable experience in the battery business the directors arranged a sale

policy, as shown by its treatment of the large sums received in the form of
income-tax refunds in the three preceding years. These receipts were not
reported as current income but were credited directly to surplus.
Profits from Sale of Marketable Securities.Profits realized by a busi-
ness corporation from the sale of marketable securities are also of a special
character and must be separated from the ordinary operating results.
Examples: The report of National Transit Company, a former Stan-
dard Oil subsidiary, for the year 1928 illustrates the distorting effect due
to the inclusion in the income account of profits from this source. The
method of presenting the story to the stockholders is also open to seri-
ous criticism. The consolidated income account for 1927 and 1928 was
stated in approximately the following terms:
[416] SECURITY ANALYSIS
Item 1927 1928
Operating revenues $3,432,000 $3,419,000
Dividends, interest, and miscella-
neous income 463,000 370,000
Total revenues $3,895,000 $3,789,000
“Operating expenses, including depreciation 
and profit and loss direct items” (in 1928 
“including profits from sale of securities”) 3,264,000 2,599,000
Net income $631,000 $1,190,000
(Earned per share) ($1.24) ($2.34)
The increase in the earnings per share appeared quite impressive. But
a study of the detailed figures of the parent company alone, as submitted
to the Interstate Commerce Commission, would have revealed that
$560,000 of the 1928 income was due to its profits from the sale of secu-
rities. This happens to be almost exactly equal to the increase in consoli-
dated net earnings over the previous year. Allowing on the one hand for
income tax and other offsets against these special profits but on the other
hand for probable additional profits from the sale of securities by the man-
ufacturing subsidiary, it seems likely that all or nearly all of the apparent
improvement in earnings for 1928 was due to nonoperating items. Such
gains must clearly be eliminated from any comparison or calculation of
earning power. The form of statement resorted to by National Transit, in

---
**[Page 469]**

Analysis of the Income Account [417]
which such profits are applied to reduce operating expenses, is bizarre to
say the least.
The sale by the New Y ork, Chicago, and St. Louis Railroad Company,
through a subsidiary, of its holdings of Pere Marquette stock in 1929 gave
rise later to an even more extraordinary form of bookkeeping manipula-
tion. We shall describe these transactions in connection with our treatment
of items involving nonconsolidated subsidiaries. During 1931 F .W . Wool-
worth Company included in its income a profit of nearly $10,000,000 on
the sale of a part interest in its British subsidiary. The effect of this inclu-
sion was to make the per-share earnings appear larger than any previous
year, when in fact they had experienced a recession. It is somewhat surpris-
ing to note that in the same year the company charged against surplus an
additional tax accrual of $2,000,000 which seemed to be closely related to
the special profit included in income.
Reduction in the market value of securities should be considered as a
nonrecurring item in the same way as losses from the sale of such secu-
rities. The same would be true of shrinkage in the value of foreign
exchange. In most cases corporations charge such write-downs, when
made, against surplus. The General Motors report for 1931 included both
such adjustments, totaling $20,575,000 as deductions from income , but
was careful to designate them as “extraordinary and nonrecurring losses. ”
Methods Used by Investment Trusts in Reporting Sale of Marketable
Securities. Investment-trust statements raise special questions with
respect to the treatment of profits or losses realized from the sale of secu-
rities and changes in security values. Prior to 1930 most of these compa-
nies reported profits from the sale of securities as part of their regular
income, but they showed the appreciation on unsold securities in the form
of a memorandum or footnote to the balance sheet. But when large losses
were taken in 1930 and subsequently, they were shown in most cases not
in the income account but as charges against capital, surplus, or reserves.
The unrealized depreciation was still recorded by most companies in the
form of an explanatory comment on the balance sheet, which continued
to carry the securities owned at original cost. A minority of investment
trusts reduced the carrying price of their portfolio to the market by means
of charges against capital and surplus.
It may logically be contended that, since dealing in securities is an
integral part of the investment-trust business, the results from sales and

---
**[Page 470]**

even the changes in portfolio values should be regarded as ordinary rather
than extraordinary elements in the year’s report. Certainly a study con-
fined to the interest and dividend receipts less expenses would prove of
negligible value. If any useful results can be expected from an analysis of
investment-trust exhibits, such analysis must clearly be based on the three
items: investment income, profits or losses on the sale of securities and
changes in market values. It is equally obvious that the gain or shrinkage,
so computed, in any one year is no indication whatever of earning power
in the recurrent sense. Nor can an average taken over several years have
any significance for the future unless the results are first compared with
some appropriate measure of general market performance. Assuming 
that an investment trust has done substantially better than the relevant
“ average, ” this is of course a prima facieindication of capable manage-
ment. But even here it would be difficult to distinguish confidently
between superior ability and luckier guesses on the market.
The gist of this critique is twofold: (1) the over-all change in princi-
pal value is the only available measure of investment-trust performance,
but (2) this measure cannot be regarded as an index of “normal earning
power” in any sense analogous to the recorded earnings of a well-
entrenched industrial business.
5
Similar Problem in the Case of Banks and Insurance Companies.A like
problem is involved in analyzing the results shown by insurance compa-
nies and by banks. Public interest in insurance securities is concentrated
largely upon the shares of fire insurance companies. These enterprises
represent a combination of the insurance business and the investment-
trust business. They have available for investment their capital funds plus
substantial amounts received as premiums paid in advance. Generally
speaking, only a small portion of these funds is subject to legal restric-
tions as regards investment, and the balance is handled in much the same
way as the resources of the investment trusts. The underwriting business
as such has rarely proved highly profitable. Frequently it shows a deficit,
which is offset, however, by interest and dividend income. The profits or
losses shown on security operations, including changes in their market
value, exert a predominant influence upon the public’s attitude toward

fire-insurance-company stocks. The same has been true of bank stocks
to a smaller, but none the less significant, degree. The tremendous over-
speculation in these issues during the late 1920’s was stimulated largely
by the participation of the banks, directly or through affiliates, in the 
fabulous profits made in the securities markets.
Since 1933 banks have been required to divorce themselves from their
affiliates, and their operations in securities other than government issues
have been more carefully supervised and restricted. But in view of the
large portion of their resources invested in bonds, substantial changes in
bond prices are still likely to exert a pronounced effect upon their
reported earnings.
The fact that the operations of financial institutions generally—such as
investment trusts, banks and insurance companies—must necessarily
reflect changes in security values makes their shares a dangerous medium
for widespread public dealings. Since in these enterprises an increase in
security values may be held to be part of the year’s profits, there is an
inevitable tendency to regard the gains made in good times as part of the
“earning power” and to value the shares accordingly. This results of course
in an absurd overvaluation, to be followed by collapse and a correspond-
ingly excessive depreciation. Such violent fluctuations are particularly
harmful in the case of financial institutions because they may affect public
confidence. It is true also that rampant speculation (called “investment”)
in bank and insurance-company stocks leads to the ill-advised launching
of new enterprises, to the unwise expansion of old ones and to a general
relaxation of established standards of conservatism and even of probity.
The securities analyst, in discharging his function of investment coun-
sellor, should do his best to discourage the purchase of stocks of banking
and insurance institutions by the ordinary small investor. Prior to the
boom of the 1920’s such securities were owned almost exclusively by
those having or commanding large financial experience and matured
judgment. These qualities are needed to avoid the special danger of mis-
judging values in this field by reason of the dependence of their reported
earnings upon fluctuations in security prices.
Herein lies also a paradoxical difficulty of the investment-trust move-
ment. Given a proper technique of management, these organizations may
well prove a logical vehicle for the placing of small investor’s funds. But
considered as a marketable security dealt in by small investors, the invest-
ment-trust stock itself is a dangerously volatile instrument. Apparently

this troublesome factor can be held in check only be educating or by effec-
tively cautioning the general public on the interpretation of investment-
trust reports. The prospects of accomplishing this are none too bright.
Profits through Repurchase of Senior Securities at a Discount.
At times a substantial profit is realized by corporations through the repur-
chase of their own senior securities at less than par value. The inclusion
of such gains in current income is certainly a misleading practice, first,
because they are obviously nonrecurring and, second, because this is at
best a questionable sort of profit, since it is made at the expense of the
company’s own security holders.
Example: A peculiar example of this accounting practice was fur-
nished as long ago as 1915 by Utah Securities Corporation, a holding
company controlling Utah Power and Light Company. The following
income account illustrates this point:

The foregoing income account shows that the chief “earnings” of Utah
Securities were derived from the repurchase of its own obligations at a
discount. Had it not been for this extraordinary item the company would
have failed to cover its interest charges.
The widespread repurchases of senior securities at a substantial dis-
count constituted one of the unique features of the 1931–1933 depression
years. It was made possible by the disproportion that existed between the
strong cash positions and the poor earnings of many enterprises. Because
of the latter influence the senior securities sold at low prices, and because
of the former the issuing companies were able to buy them back in large
amounts. This practice was most in evidence among the investment trusts.

Analysis of the Income Account [421]
Examples: The International Securities Corporation of America, to
use an outstanding example, repurchased in the fiscal year ending
November 30, 1932, no less than $12,684,000 of its 5% bonds, represent-
ing nearly half of the issue. The average price paid was about 55, and the
operation showed a profit of about $6,000,000, which served to offset the
shrinkage in the value of the investment portfolio.
In the industrial field we note the report of Armour and Company for
1932. This showed net earnings of $1,633,000 but only after including in
income a profit of $5,520,000 on bonds bought in at a heavy discount.
Similarly, more than all of the 1933 net of Goodrich Rubber, United Drug,
Bush Terminal Building Company and others was ascribable to this non-
recurring source. A like condition was disclosed in the report of United
Cigar-Whelan Stores for the first half of 1938.
6 (Observe, on the other
hand, that some companies, e.g., Gulf States Steel Corporation in 1933,
have followed the better practice of crediting this profit direct to surplus.)
A contrary result appears when senior securities are retired at a 
cost exceeding the face or stated value. When this premium involves a
large amount, it is always charged against surplus and not against cur-
rent income.
Examples: As prominent illustrations of this practice, we cite the
charge of $40,600,000 against surplus made by United States Steel Cor-
poration in 1929, in connection with the retirement at 110 of
$307,000,000 of its own and subsidiaries’ bonds, also the charge of
$9,600,000 made against surplus in 1927 by Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Company, growing out of the retirement at a premium of various bond
and preferred-stock issues and their replacement by new securities bear-
ing lower coupon and dividend rates. From the analyst’s standpoint, either
profit or expense in such special transactions involving the company’s
own securities should be regarded as nonrecurring and excluded from
the operating results in studying a single year’s performance.
A Comprehensive Example. American Machine and Metals, Inc. 
(successor to Manhattan Electrical Supply Company mentioned earlier
in this chapter), included in its current income for 1932 a profit realized
from the repurchase of its own bonds at a discount. Because the reports
for 1931 and 1932 illustrate to an unusual degree the arbitrary nature of

much corporate accounting, we reproduce herewith in full the income

We find again in 1932, as in 1926, the highly objectionable practice of
including extraordinary profits in income while charging special losses
to surplus. It does not make much difference that in the later year the

nature of the special profit—gain through repurchase of bonds at less than
par—is disclosed in the report. Stockholders and stock buyers for the
most part pay attention only to the final figure of earnings per share, as
presented by the company; nor are they likely to inquire carefully into the
manner in which it is determined. The significance of some of the charges
made by this company against surplus in 1932 will be taken up later under
the appropriate headings.
Other Nonrecurrent Items. The remaining group of nonrecurrent
profit items is not important enough to merit detailed discussion. In most
cases it is of minor consequence whether they appear as part of the year’s
earnings or are credited to surplus where they properly belong.
Examples: Gimbel Brothers included the sum of $167,660, proceeds
of life insurance policies, in income for 1938, designating it as a “non-
trading item. ” On the other hand, United Merchants and Manufacturers,
receiving a similar payment of $1,579,000 in its 1938 fiscal year, more
soundly credited it to surplus—although it had sustained a large loss from
operations.
Bendix Aviation Corporation reported as income for the year 1929
the sum of $901,282 received in settlement of a patent suit, and again in
1931 it included in current earnings an amount $242,656 paid to it as back
royalties collected through litigation. The 1932 earnings of Gulf Oil Cor-
poration included the sum of $5,512,000 representing the value of oil pre-
viously in litigation. By means of this item, designated as nonrecurrent,
it was able to turn a loss of $2,768,000 into a profit of $2,743,000.
Although tax refunds are regularly shown as credits to surplus only, the
accumulated interest received thereon sometimes appears as part of the
income account, e.g., $2,000,000 reported by E. I. du Pont de Nemours
and Company in 1926 and an unstated but apparently much larger sum
included in the earnings of United States Steel for 1930.

Chapter 32
EXTRAORDINARY LOSSES AND
OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS IN THE
INCOME ACCOUNT
THE QUESTION OF NONRECURRENT LOSSES is likely to create peculiar diffi-
culties in the analysis of income accounts. To what extent should write-
downs of inventories and receivables be regarded as extraordinary
deductions not fairly chargeable against the year’s operating results? In
the disastrous year 1932 such charge-offs were made by nearly every busi-
ness. The accounting methods used showed wide divergences, but the
majority of companies spared their income accounts as much as possible
and subtracted these losses from surplus. On the other hand the milder
inventory losses of the 1937–1938 recession were almost universally
charged into the earnings statement.
Inventory losses are directly related to the conduct of the business and
are, therefore, by no means extraordinary in their general character. The
collapse of inventory values in 1931–1932 might be considered extraor-
dinary in its extent, in the same way as the business results as a whole were
exceptional. It follows from this reasoning that if the 1931–1932 results
are taken into account at all, e.g., in computing a long-term average, all
losses on inventories and receivables must be considered part of the oper-
ating deficit of those years even though charged to surplus. In Chap. 37
we shall consider the role of extraordinary years in determining the 
average earning power.
Manufactured Earnings. An examination of the wholesale charges
made against surplus in 1932 by American Machine and Metals, detailed
on page 422, suggests the possibility that excessive provision for losses
may have been made in that year with the intention of benefiting future
income accounts. If the receivables and inventories were written down to

an unduly low figure on December 31, 1932, this artificially low “cost
price” would give rise to a correspondingly inflated profit in the follow-
ing years. This point may be made clear by the use of hypothetical 
figures as follows:
Assume fair value of inventory and receivables on 
Dec. 31, 1932 to be . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $2,000,000
Assume profit for 1933 based on such fair value . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 200,000
But assume that, by special and excessive charges to surplus, 
the inventory and receivables had been written down to . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,600,000
Then the amounts realized therefrom will show a 
correspondingly greater profit for 1933, which might 
mean reported earnings for 1933 of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 600,000
This would be three times the proper figure.
The foregoing example illustrates a whole set of practices that consti-
tute perhaps the most vicious type of accounting manipulation. They con-
sist, in brief, of taking sums out of surplus (or even capital) and then
reporting these same sums as income. The charge to surplus goes unno-
ticed; the credit to income may have a determining influence upon the
market price of the securities of the company.
1 We shall later point out
that the “conservative” writing down of the property account has precisely
this result, in that it permits a decreased depreciation charge and hence
an increase in the apparent earnings. The dangers inherent in account-
ing methods of this sort are the more serious because they are so little
realized by the public, so difficult to detect even by the expert analyst and
so impervious to legislative or stock-exchange correction.
The basing of common-stock values on reported per-share earnings
has made it much easier for managements to exercise an arbitrary and
1 The United States Industrial Alcohol Company reports for 1932 and subsequent years
reflect a situation somewhat similar to that here suggested. This company departed from its
usual practice in 1932 by setting up a reserve for $1,500,000 out of surplus to reduce
molasses inventory to estimated current market value. (Previously this item had regularly
been carried at cost.) Later reports state that earnings for 1933, 1934 and 1935 had benefited
by this reserve to the extent of $772,000, $677,000 and $51,000 respectively. Significantly,
income tax for 1934 was based on $677,000 less than the reported profit. (See pp. 626–627
for a broad summary of the effect of this company’s accounting methods on its reported per-
share earnings for the years 1929–1938.)

unwholesome control over the price level of their shares. Whereas it
should be emphasized that the overwhelming majority of managements
are honest, it must be emphasized also that loose or “purposive” account-
ing is a highly contagious disease.
Reserves for Inventory Losses. The accounting for inventory losses
is frequently complicated by the use of reserves set up before the loss is
actually realized. These reserves are usually created by a charge to sur-
plus, on the theory that it is a function of the surplus account to act as
a sort of contingency reserve to absorb unusual future losses. If later the
inventory shrinkage actually takes place, it is naturally charged against
the reserve already created to meet it. The result is that in no year does
the income account reflect the inventory loss, although it is just as much
a hazard of operations as a decline in selling prices. When a company
charges inventory losses to surplus—whether directly or through the
intermediary of a reserve device—the analyst must take this practice
carefully into account, especially in comparing the published results
with those of other companies. A good illustration of this rule is
afforded by a comparison of the reports submitted by United States
Rubber Company and by Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company for the
years 1925–1927, during which time rubber prices were subject to wide
fluctuations.
In these three years Goodyear charged against earnings a total of
$11,500,000 as reserves against decline of raw-material prices. Of this
amount one-half was used to absorb actual losses sustained and the other
half was carried forward into 1928 (and eventually used up in 1930).
United States Rubber during this period charged a total of $20,446,000
for inventory reserves and write-downs, all of which was absorbed by
actual losses taken. But the form of annual statement, as submitted to the
stockholders, excluded these deductions from income and made them
appear as special adjustments of surplus. (In 1927, moreover, the inven-
tory loss of $8,910,000 was apparently offset by a special credit of
$8,000,000 from the transfer of past earnings of the crude-rubber pro-
ducing subsidiary.)
The result of these divergent bases of reporting annual income was
that the per-share earnings of the two companies, as compiled by the sta-
tistical manuals, made an entirely misleading comparative exhibit. The
following per-share earnings are taken from Poor’s Manualfor 1928:

For proper comparative purposes the statements must manifestly be
considered on an identical basis, or as close thereto as possible. Such a
comparison might be made by three possible methods, viz.:
1. As reported by United States Rubber, i.e. , excluding inventory
reserves and losses from the current income account.
2. As reported by Goodyear, i.e., reducing the earnings of the period
of high prices for crude rubber by a reserve for future losses and using
this reserve to absorb the later shrinkage.
3. Eliminating such reserves, as an arbitrary effort of the management
to level out the earnings. On this basis the inventory losses would be
deducted from the results of the year in which they were actually sus-
tained. (The Standard Statistics Company’s analysis of Goodyear includes
a revision of the reported earnings in conformity with this approach.)
We have then, for comparative purposes, three statements of the 
per-share earnings for the period:

More recently United States Rubber has followed the Goodyear prac-
tice of taking out of the earnings of prosperous years a reserve for future
inventory shrinkage. As a result of this policy, the company somewhat
understated its earnings for 1935 and 1936 but overstated them for 1937.
A More Recent Contrast. The packing industry supplies us with a
more extreme divergence in the method used by two companies to han-
dle the matter of probable future inventory losses.
Wilson and Company set up a reserve of $750,000 prior to the begin-
ning of its 1934 fiscal year, for “Fluctuation in Inventory Valuation. ” This
was taken partly from surplus and partly from income. In 1934 it reduced
its opening inventory by this reserve, thus increasing the year’s reported
profit by $750,000. The S.E.C., however, required it to amend its registra-
tion statement so as to credit this amount to surplus and not to income.
On the other hand, Swift and Company reduced its reported earnings
in the fiscal years 1933–1935 by $16,767,000, which was set up as a reserve
for future inventory decline. In 1938 the expected decline occurred; but
instead of drawing on this reserve to spare the income account, the com-
pany charged the full loss against the year’s operations and then transferred
$11,000,000 of the reserve directly to surplus. In this exceptional case the
net income for the six-year period 1933–1938 was understated, since
amounts were actually taken out of income and turned over to surplus.

Other Elements in Inventory Accounting. The student of corpo-
rate reports must familiarize himself with two permissible variations from

tions for inventory declines as charges to surplus.

Analysis of the Income Account  [429]
the usual accounting practice in handling inventories. As is well known,
the standard procedure consists of taking inventory at the close of the
year at the lower of cost or market. The “cost of goods sold” is then found
by adding purchases to the opening inventory and subtracting the 
closing inventory, valued as described.
Last-In, First-Out. The first variation from this method consists of
taking as the cost of goods sold the actual amount paid for the most
recently acquiredlots. The theory behind this method is that a merchant’s
selling price is related mainly to the current replacement price or the
recent cost of the article sold. The point is of importance only when there
are substantial changes in unit values from year to year; it cannot affect
the aggregate reported profits over a long period but only the division of
results from one year to another; it may be useful in reducing income tax
by avoiding alternations of loss and profit due to inventory fluctuations.
3
The Normal-stock or Basic-stock Inventory Method. A more radical
method of minimizing fluctuations due to inventory values has been fol-
lowed by a considerable number of companies for some years past. This
method is based on the theory that the company must regularly carry a
certain physical stock of materials and that there is no more reason to vary
the value of this “normal stock” from year to year—because of market
changes—than there would be to vary the value of the manufacturing plant
as the price index rises or falls and to reflect this change in the year’s oper-
ations. In order to permit the base inventory to be carried at an unchang-
ing figure, the practice is to mark it down to a very low unit price level—so
low that it should never be necessary to reduce it further to get it down to
current market.
As long ago as 1913 National Lead Company applied this method to
the three principal constituents of its inventory, viz., lead, tin and anti-
mony. The method was subsequently adopted also by American Smelt-
ing and Refining Company and American Metals Company. Some of the
New England cotton mills had followed a like policy, prior to the collapse
in the cotton market in 1930, by carrying their raw cotton and work in
process at very low base prices. In 1936 the Plymouth Cordage Company
3 Corporations were first permitted to use this so-called “last-in, first-out” method by the
terms of the Revenue Acts of 1938 and 1939, applying to 1939 and subsequent years. A
hypothetical example to illustrate the difference between the two inventory methods is given
in Appendix Note 48, p. 784 on accompanying CD.

adopted the normal-stock inventory method, after following a somewhat
similar policy in 1933–1935; and for purpose of concrete illustration we
supply the relevant data for this company, covering the years 1930–1939,
in Appendix Note 49, page 785 on accompanying CD.
Idle-plant Expense. The cost of carrying nonoperating properties is
almost always charged against income. Many statements for 1932 ear-
marked substantial deductions under this heading.
Examples: Y oungstown Sheet and Tube Company reported a charge of
$2,759,000 for “Maintenance Expense, Insurance and Taxes of Plants,
Mines, and Other Properties that were Idle. ” Stewart Warner Corporation
followed the exceptional policy of charging against surplusin 1932, instead
of income, the sum of $309,000 for “Depreciation of Plant Facilities not
used in current year’s production. ” The 1938 report of Botany Worsted
Mills contained a charge against income of $166,732, picturesquely termed
“cost of idleness.”
The analyst may properly consider idle-plant expense as belonging to
a somewhat different category from ordinary charges against income. In
theory, at least, these expenses should be of a temporary and therefore non-
recurring type. Presumably the management can terminate these losses at
any time by disposing of or abandoning the property. If, for the time being,
the company elects to spend money to carry these assets along in the expec-
tation that future value will justify the outlay, it does not seem logical to
consider these assets as equivalent to a permanent liability, i.e., as a perma-
nent drag upon the company’s earning power, which makes the stock worth
considerably less than it would be if these “assets” did not exist.
Example: The practical implications of this point are illustrated by the
case of New Y ork Transit Company, a carrier of oil by pipe line. In 1926,
owing to new competitive conditions, it lost all the business formerly car-
ried by its principal line, which thereupon became “idle plant. ” The depre-
ciation, taxes and other expenses of this property were so heavy as to
absorb the earnings of the company’s other profitable assets (consisting
of a smaller pipe line and high-grade-bond investments). This created an
apparent net loss and caused the dividend to be passed. The price of the
stock accordingly declined to a figure far less than the company’s hold-
ings of cash and marketable securities alone. In this uncritical appraisal
by the stock market, the idle asset was considered equivalent to a serious
and permanent liability.
[430] SECURITY ANALYSIS

**[Page 483]**

Analysis of the Income Account  [431]
In 1928, however, the directors determined to put an end to these
heavy carrying charges and succeeded in selling the unused pipe line for
a substantial sum of money. Thereafter, the stockholders received special
cash distributions aggregating $72 per share (nearly twice the average
market price for 1926 and 1927), and they still retained ownership of a
profitable business which resumed regular dividends. Even if no money
had been realized from the idle property, its mere abandonment would
have led to a considerable increase in the value of the shares.
This is an impressive, if somewhat extreme, example of the practical
utility of security analysis in detecting discrepancies between intrinsic
value and market price. It is customary to refer with great respect to the
“bloodless verdict of the market place, ” as though it represented invari-
ably the composite judgment of countless shrewd, informed and calcu-
lating minds. Very frequently, however, these appraisals are based on mob
psychology, on faulty reasoning, and on the most superficial examination
of inadequate information. The analyst, on his side, is usually unable to
apply his technique effectively to correcting or taking advantage of these
popular errors, for the reason that surrounding conditions change so rap-
idly that his own conclusions may become inapplicable before he can
profit by them. But in the exceptional case, as illustrated by our last exam-
ple, the facts and the logic of the case may be sharply enough defined to
warrant a high degree of confidence in the practical value of his analysis.
Deferred Charges. A business sometimes incurs expenses that may
fairly be considered as applicable to a number of years following rather
than to the single 12-month period in which the outlay was made. Under
this heading might be included the following:
Organization expense (legal fees, etc.).
Moving expenses.
Development expenses (for new products or processes, also for opening
up a mine, etc.).
Discount on obligations sold.
Under approved accounting methods such costs are spread over an
appropriate period of years. The amount involved is entered upon the bal-
ance sheet as a Deferred Charge, which is written off by annual charges
against earnings. In the case of bond-discount the period is fixed by the
life of the issue; mine development expenses are similarly prorated on the

---
**[Page 484]**

basis of the tonnage mined. For most other items the number of years
must be arbitrarily taken, five years being a customary figure.
In order to relieve the reported earnings of these annual deductions it
has become common practice to write off such expense applicable to future
years by a single charge against surplus. In theory this practice is improper,
because it results in the understatement of operating expenses for a suc-
ceeding period of years and hence in the exaggeration of the net income.
If, to take a simple example, the president’s salary were paid for ten years
in advance and the entire outlay charged against surplus as a “special
expense, ” it is clear that the profits of the ensuing period would thereby be
overstated.
4 There is the danger also that expenses of a character frequently
repeated, e.g., advertising campaigns, or cost of developing new automo-
bile models, might be omitted from the income account by designating
them as deferred charges and then writing them off against surplus.
5
Ordinarily the amounts involved in such accounting transactions are
not large enough to warrant the analyst’s making an issue of them. Secu-
rity analysis is a severely practical activity, and it must not linger over mat-
ters that are not likely to affect the ultimate judgment. At times however,
these items may assume appreciable importance.
Examples:The Kraft Cheese Company for example, during some years
prior to 1927 carried a substantial part of its advertising outlays as a
deferred charge to be absorbed in the operations of subsequent years. In
1926 it spent about $1,000,000 for advertising and charged only one-half
of this amount against current income. But in the same year the balance
of this expenditure was deducted from surplus, and furthermore an addi-
tional $480,000 was similarly written off against surplus to cancel the bal-
ance carried forward from prior years as a deferred charge. By this means
the company was able to report to its stockholders the sum of $1,071,000
as earned for 1926. But when in the following year it applied to list addi-
tional shares, it found it necessary to adopt a less questionable basis of

lowed by Interstate Department Stores in 1934–1936, which resembled somewhat the hypo-
thetical case given above.
5 A similar objection lies against the practice of charging against surplus the loss incurred in
closing chain-store units. Example: The charge of $326,000 made by F . G. Shattuck Company
for this purpose in 1935. This would seem to be a recurrent expense of chain-store enter-
prises, which frequently add and close down units.

reporting its income to the New Y ork Stock Exchange, so that its profit
for 1926 was restated to read $461,296, instead of $1,071,000.
The 1932 report of International Telephone and Telegraph Company
showed various charges against surplus aggregating $35,817,000, which
included the following: “Write-off of certain deferred charges that have
today no tangible value although originally set up to be amortized over a
period of years in accordance with accepted accounting principles,
$4,655,696. ”
Hudson Motor Car Company charged against surplus instead of
income the following items (among others) during 1930–1931.

development of new models  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $2,266,000

In 1933 Hecker Products (then called Gold Dust Corporation) appro-
priated out of surplus the sum of $2,000,000 as a reserve for the “net cost
of introduction and exploitation of new products. ” About three-quarters
of this amount was expended in years 1933–1936, and the balance then
transferred to “General and Contingency Reserves. ”
The effect of these accounting practices is to relieve the reported earn-
ings of expenditures that most companies charge currently thereagainst,
and that in any event should be charged against earnings in installments
over a short period of years.
Amortization of Bond Discount. Bonds are usually floated by cor-
porations at a price to net the treasury less than par. The discount suf-
fered is part of the cost of borrowing the money, i.e., part of the interest
burden, and it should be amortized over the life of the bond issue by an
annual charge against earnings, included with the statement of interest
paid. It was formerly considered “conservative” to write off such bond
discounts by a single charge against surplus, in order not to show so
intangible an item among the assets on the balance sheet. More recently
these write-offs against surplus have become popular for the opposite rea-
son, viz., to eliminate future annual deductions from earnings and in that
way to make the shares more “valuable. ”

---
**[Page 486]**

Example: Associated Gas and Electric Company charged against 
surplus in 1932 the sum of $5,892,000 for “debt discount and expense”
written off.
This practice has aroused considerable criticism in recent years both
from the New Y ork Stock Exchange and from the S.E.C. As a result of
these objections a number of companies have reversed their previous
charge to surplus and are again charging amortization of bond discounts
annually against earnings.
6
[434] SECURITY ANALYSIS
6 See the changed accounting practice of Northern States Power Company (Minnesota) fol-
lowing a controversy over this point in connection with the registration of a bond issue in
1984. (The total amount involved here was over $8,000,000.) It is noteworthy, also, that even
on called bonds companies have been required to carry forward the unamortized discount to
be written off by an annual charge against earnings during the life of the refunding issue.
(See the report of Columbia Gas and Electric Company for 1936, p. 17.)
Some of the bond refundings in recent years seem to have involved a surprisingly small
net saving of interest when the premium paid to retire the old issue is taken into account.
Perhaps an explanation of some of these operations lies in the fact that (1) the company has
been able to charge both the premium paid and the balance of the original discount against
surplus, thus relieving future earnings of this very real burden; and (2) both these items have
been chargeable to profits subject to income tax, thus reducing this tax substantially and
increasing the apparent profits for the year.

MISLEADING ARTIFICES IN THE INCOME
ACCOUNT. EARNINGS OF SUBSIDIARIES
Flagrant Example of Padded Income Account.On comparatively
rare occasions, managements resort to padding their income account by
including items in earnings that have no real existence. Perhaps the most
flagrant instance of this kind that has come to our knowledge occurred
in the 1929–1930 reports of Park and Tilford, Inc., an enterprise with
shares listed on the New Y ork Stock Exchange. For these years the com-
pany reported net income as follows:
1929—$1,001,130 /H11005$4.72 per share.
1930— 124,563 /H110050.57 per share.
An examination of the balance sheets discloses that during these two
years the item of Good-will and Trade-marks was written up successively
from $1,000,000 to $1,600,000 and then to $2,000,000, and these increases
deducted from the expenses for the period. The extraordinary character
of the bookkeeping employed will be apparent from a study of the con-
densed balance sheets as of three dates, shown on page 436.
These figures show a reduction of $1,600,000 in net current assets in
15 months, or $1,000,000 more than the cash dividends paid. This shrink-
age was concealed by a $1,000,000 write-up of Good-will and Trade-
marks. No statement relating to these amazing entries was vouchsafed to
the stockholders in the annual reports or to the New Y ork Stock Exchange
in subsequent listing applications. In answer to an individual inquiry,
however, the company stated that these additions to Good-will and
Trade-marks represented expenditures for advertising and other sales
efforts to develop the business of Tintex Company, Inc., a subsidiary.

[435]
1 In the 1930 report the wording in the balance sheet was changed from “Good-will and
Trade-marks” to “Tintex Good-will and Trade-marks. ” In 1939 the Good-will item was writ-
ten off, and the $1,000,000 write-up of 1929–1930 deducted from earned surplus.

Analysis of the Income Account [437]
The charging of current advertising expense to the good-will account
is inadmissible under all canons of sound accounting. To do so without
any disclosure to the stockholders is still more discreditable. It is difficult
to believe, moreover, that the sum of $600,000 could have been expended
for this purpose by Park and Tilford in the three monthsbetween Septem-
ber 30 and December 31, 1929. The entry appears therefore to have
included a recrediting to current income of expenditures made in a pre-
vious period, and to that extent the results for the fourth quarter of 1929
may have been flagrantly distorted. Needless to say, no accountants’ cer-
tificate accompanied the annual statements of this enterprise.
Balance-sheet and Income-tax Checks upon the Published
Earnings Statements. The Park and Tilford case illustrates the neces-
sity of relating an analysis of income accounts to an examination of the
appurtenant balance sheets. This is a point that cannot be stressed too
strongly, in view of Wall Street’s naïve acceptance of reported income and
reported earnings per share. Our example suggests also a further check
upon the reliability of the published earnings statements, viz., by the
amount of the federal income tax accrued. The taxable profit can be cal-
culated fairly readily from the income-tax accrual, and this profit com-
pared in turn with the earnings reported to stockholders. The two figures
should not necessarily be the same, since the intricacies of the tax laws
may give rise to a number of divergences.
2 We do not suggest that any
effort be made to reconcile the amounts absolutely but only that very wide
differences be noted and made the subject of further inquiry.
The Park and Tilford figures analyzed from this viewpoint supply the
suggestive results as shown in the table on page 438.
The close correspondence of the tax accrual with the reported income
during the earlier period makes the later discrepancy appear the more
striking. These figures eloquently cast suspicion upon the truthfulness of
the reports made to the stockholders during 1927–1929, at which time
considerable manipulation was apparently going on in the shares.
This and other examples discussed herein point strongly to the need
for independent audits of corporate statements by certified public account-

net income upon which the federal tax is paid. In our opinion a good deal
of the information relative to minor matters that appears in registration
statements and prospectuses might be dispensed with to general advan-
tage; but if, in lieu thereof, the S.E.C. were to require such a reconcilement,
the cause of security analysis would be greatly advanced.

Another Extraordinary Case of Manipulated Accounting. An
accounting vagary fully as extraordinary as that of Park and Tilford, though
exercising a smaller influence on the reported earnings, was indulged 
in by United Cigar Stores Company of America, from 1924–1927. The “the-
ory” behind the entries was explained by the company for the first time in
May 1927 in a listing application that contained the following paragraphs:
3
The Company owns several hundred long-term leaseholds on business build-
ings in the principal cities of the United States, which up until May, 1924, were
not set up on the books. Accordingly, at that time they were appraised by the
Company and Messrs. F . W . Lafrentz and Company, certified public account-
ants of New Y ork City, in excess of $20,000,000.
The Board of Directors have, since that time, authorized every three months
the setting up among the assets of the Company a portion of this valuation
and the capitalization thereof, in the form of dividends, payable in Common
Stock at par on the Common Stock on the quarterly basis of 1
1/4% on the
Common Stock issued and outstanding.

America on the New Y ork Stock Exchange, dated May 18, 1927 (Application #A-7552).

Analysis of the Income Account [439]
The entire capital surplus created in this manner has been absorbed by the
issuance of Common Stock at par for an equal amount and accordingly is
not a part of the existing surplus of the Company. No cash dividends have
been declared out of such capital surplus so created.
The present estimated value of such leaseholds, using the same basis of
appraisal as in 1924, is more than twice the present value shown on the books
of the Company.
The effect of the inclusion of “ Appreciation of Leaseholds” in earnings
is shown herewith:

† Excluding refund of federal taxes of $229,017 applicable to prior years.
In passing judgment on the inclusion of leasehold appreciation in the
current earnings of United Cigar Stores, a number of considerations
might well be borne in mind.
1. Leaseholds are essentially as much a liability as they are an asset.
They are an obligation to pay rent for premises occupied. Ironically
enough, these very leaseholds of United Cigar Stores eventually plunged
it into bankruptcy.
2. Assuming leaseholds may acquire a capital value to the occupant,
such value is highly intangible, and it is contrary to accounting principles
to mark up above actual cost the value of such intangibles in a balance
sheet.
3. If the value of any capital asset is to be marked up, such enhance-
ment must be credited to Capital Surplus. By no stretch of the imagina-
tion can it be considered as income.

---
**[Page 492]**

4. The $20,000,000 appreciation of the United Cigar Stores leases took
place prior to May 1924, but it was treated as income in subsequent years.
There was thus no connection between the $2,437,000 appreciation
included in the profits of 1927 and the operations or developments of
that year.
5. If the leaseholds had really increased in value, the effect should be
visible in larger earnings realized from these favorable locations. Any
other recognition given this enhancement would mean counting the same
value twice. In fact, however, allowing for extensions of the business
financed by additional capitalization, the per-share earnings of United
Cigar Stores showed no advancing trend.
6. Whatever value is given to leaseholds must be amortized over the
life of the lease. If the United Cigar Stores investors were paying a high
price for the shares because of earnings produced by these valuable leases,
then they should deductfrom earnings an allowance to write off this cap-
ital value by the time it disappears through the expiration of the leases.
4
The United Cigar Stores Company continued to amortize its leaseholds
on the basis of original cost, which apparently was practically nothing.
The surprising truth of the matter, therefore, is that the effect of the
appreciation of leasehold values—if it had occurred—should have been to
reducethe subsequent operating profits by an increased amortization charge.
7. The padding of the United Cigar Stores income for 1924–1927 was
made the more reprehensible by the failure to reveal the facts clearly in
the annual reports to shareholders.
5 Disclosure of the essential facts to
the New Y ork Stock Exchange was made nearly three years after the prac-
tice was initiated. It may have been compelled by legal considerations
growing out of the sale to the public at that time of a new issue of pre-
ferred stock, underwritten by large financial institutions. The following
year the policy of including leasehold appreciation in earnings was dis-
continued.
These accounting maneuvers of United Cigar Stores may be fairly
described, therefore, as the unexplainedinclusion in current earnings of an

5 The reports stated the “Net Profit for the year, including Enhancement of Leasehold 
Values” (giving amount of the latter), but no indication was afforded that this enhancement
was arbitrarily computed and had taken place in previous years.

imaginary appreciation of an intangibleasset—the asset being in reality a
liability, the enhancement being related to a previousperiod and the proper
effect of the appreciation, if it had occurred, being to reducethe subsequent
realized earnings by virtue of higher amortization charges.
The federal-income-tax check, described in the Park and Tilford
example, will also give interesting results if applied to United Cigar Stores
as shown in the table below.
Moral Drawn from Foregoing Examples. A moral of considerable
practical utility may be drawn from the United Cigar Stores example.
When an enterprise pursues questionable accounting policies, all its secu-
rities must be shunned by the investor, no matter how safe or attractive
some of them may appear. This is well illustrated by United Cigar Stores
Preferred, which made an exceedingly impressive statistical showing for
many successive years but later narrowly escaped complete extinction.
Investors confronted with the strange bookkeeping detailed above might
have reasoned that the issue was still perfectly sound, because, when the
overstatement of earnings was corrected, the margin of safety remained
more than ample. Such reasoning is fallacious. Y ou cannot make a quan-
titative deduction to allow for an unscrupulous management; the only
way to deal with such situations is to avoid them.

Fictitious Value Placed on Stock Dividends Received. From
1922 on most of the United Cigar Stores common shares were held by
Tobacco Products Corporation, an enterprise controlled by the same
interests. This was an important company, the market value of its shares
averaging more than $100,000,000 in 1926 and 1927. The accounting
practice of Tobacco Products introduced still another way of padding the
income account, viz., by placing a fictitious valuation upon stock divi-
dends received.
For the year 1926 the company’s earnings statement read as follows:

Detailed information regarding the company’s affairs during that
period has never been published (the New Y ork Stock Exchange having
been unaccountably willing to list new shares on submission of an
extremely sketchy exhibit). Sufficient information is available, however,
to indicate that the net income was made up substantially as follows:
Rental received from lease of assets to American Tobacco Co.  . . . . . . . . . . $  2,500,000

It is to be noted that Tobacco Products must have valued the stock
dividends received from United Cigar Stores at about three times their
face value, i.e., at three times the value at which United Cigar charged
them against surplus. Presumably the basis of this valuation by Tobacco
Products was the market price of United Cigar Stores shares, which price
was easily manipulated due to the small amount of stock not owned by
Tobacco Products.

dends received at a higher value than that assigned them by the subsidiary

that pays them, we have a particularly dangerous form of pyramiding of
earnings. The New Y ork Stock Exchange, beginning in 1929, has made
stringent regulations forbidding this practice. (The point was discussed
in Chap. 30, which is on accompanying CD.) In the case of Tobacco Prod-
ucts the device was especially objectionable because the stock dividend
was issued in the first instance to represent a fictitious element of earn-
ings, i.e., the appreciation of leasehold values. By unscrupulous exploita-
tion of the holding-company mechanism these imaginary profits were
effectively multiplied by three.
On a consolidated earnings basis, the report of Tobacco Products for
1926 would read as follows:

The reported earnings for Tobacco Products common given as $11
per share are seen to have been overstated by about 50%.
It may be stated as a Wall-Street maxim that where manipulation of
accounts is found, stock juggling will be found also in some form or other.
Familiarity with the methods of questionable finance should assist the
analyst and perhaps even the public, in detecting such practices when
they are perpetrated.

SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES AND 
CONSOLIDATED REPORTS
This title introduces our second general type of adjustment of reported
earnings. When an enterprise controls one or more important sub-
sidiaries, a consolidated income account is necessary to supply a true 
picture of the year’s operations. Figures showing the parent company’s
6 To avoid an implication of inconsistency, because of our favorable comments on Tobacco
Products Corporation 61/2s, due 2022, in a previous chapter, we must point out that a com-
plete change of management took place in this situation during 1930. There have also been
two complete changes in the management of United Cigar Stores and its successor.

results only are incomplete and may be quite misleading. As previously
remarked, they may either understate the earnings by not showing all the
current profits made by the subsidiaries, or they may overstate the earn-
ings by failure to deduct subsidiaries’ losses or by including dividends
from subsidiaries in excess of their actual income for the year.
Former and Current Practices. In earlier years disclosure of sub-
sidiaries’ results was a matter of arbitrary election by management, and
in many cases important data of this kind were kept secret.
7 For some
time prior to 1933 the New Y ork Stock Exchange had insisted in connec-
tion with new listings that the results of subsidiaries be presented either
in a consolidated statement or separately. But since passage of the 1934
act, all registered companies are required to supply this information in
their annual reports to the Commission, and therefore practically all fol-
low the same procedure in their statements to stockholders.
Degree of Consolidation. Even in so-called “consolidated state-
ments” the degree of consolidation varies considerably. Woolworth con-
solidates its domestic and Canadian subsidiaries but not its foreign
affiliates. American Tobacco consolidates only its wholly owned domes-
tic subsidiaries. Most utilities now issue consolidated reports including
all companies controlled by them (by ownership of a majority of the vot-
ing stock) and deduct the portion of the earnings applicable to others
under the heading of “minority interest. ”
8 In the railroad field results are
rarely consolidated unless the subsidiary is both 100% owned and also
operated as an integral part of the system. Hence, Atlantic Coast Line
does not reflect its share of the results after dividends of Louisville and
Nashville, which is 51% owned but separately operated. The same is 
true with respect to the 53% voting control of Wheeling and Lake Erie
held by the Nickel Plate (New Y ork, Chicago, and St. Louis Railroad
Company).
[444] SECURITY ANALYSIS
7 For a discussion of the misleading effect of such policies in former years, see references to
Reading Company, Consolidated Gas Company (now Consolidated Edison Company), and
Warren Brothers Company, on pp. 380–381 of the first edition of this work. Prior to the
S.E.C. legislation, most railroad companies failed to supply any information regarding the
earnings of their nontransportation subsidiaries, some of which were of substantial impor-
tance. Examples: Northern Pacific, Atchison.
8 North American Company has been somewhat exceptional in that it consolidates only 
subsidiaries at least 75% owned and thus excludes two important companies in which its
interest in 1939 was 73.5 and 51%, respectively.

Analysis of the Income Account [445]
Allowance for Nonconsolidated Profits and Losses.It is now fre-
quent procedure for industrial companies to indicate either in the income
account or in a footnote thereto their equity in the profits or losses of 
nonconsolidated subsidiaries after allowance for dividends.
Examples:The 1938 report of American Tobacco Company showed by
way of footnote that dividends received from nonconsolidated subsidiaries
exceeded their earnings by $427,000. Hercules Powder reported a similar
figure of $257,514 for that year, in footnote form, whereas prior to 1937 it
had included its share of the undistributed earnings of such affiliates under
the heading “Other Income. ” Railroad companies handle this matter dif-
ferently. The Atchison, for example, now supplies full balance sheet and
income account data of affiliates in an Appendix to its own report, which
continues to reflect only the dividends received from these companies.
The analyst should adjust the reported earnings for the results of non-
consolidated affiliates, if this has not already been done in the income
account and if the amounts involved are significant. The criterion here is
not the technical question of control but the importance of the holdings.
Examples:On the one hand it is not customary, nor does it seem worth
while, to make such calculations with respect to the holdings of Union
Pacific in Illinois Central and other railroads. These holdings, although
substantial, do not bulk large enough to affect the Union Pacific common
stock materially. On the other hand, the adjustment is clearly indicated
in the case of the ownership of Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy stock by
Northern Pacific and Great Northern, each holding less than a control-
ling interest (48.6%).

Similarly, the interest of Du Pont in General Motors, representing
about 23% of the total issue, is undoubtedly significant enough in its effect
on the owning company to warrant adjustment of its earnings to reflect
the results of General Motors. This is actually done by Du Pont each year
in the form of an adjustment of surplusto reflect the previous year’s change
in the book value of its General Motors holdings. The analyst would pre-
fer, however, to make the adjustment concurrently and to include it in the
calculated earnings of Du Pont. The effect of such adjustments on the
earnings of Du Pont for 1929–1938 is shown in the table on p. 445.
The report of General Motors Corporation for 1931 is worthy of
appreciative attention because it includes a supplementary calculation of
the kind suggested in this and the previous chapter i.e., exclusive of spe-
cial and nonrecurring profits or losses and inclusive of General Motors’
interest in the results of nonconsolidated subsidiaries. The report con-
tains the following statement of per-share earnings for 1931 and 1930:

Suggested Procedure for Statistical Agencies. Although this pro-
cedure may seem to complicate a report, it is in fact a salutary antidote
against the oversimplification of common-stock analysis which resulted
from exclusive preoccupation with the single figure of per-share earnings.
The statistical manuals and agencies have naturally come to feature the
per-share earnings in their analyses of corporations. They might, how-
ever, perform a more useful service if they omitted a calculation of the
per-share earnings in all cases where the company’s reports appear to con-
tain irregularities or complications in any of the following directions and
where a satisfactory correction is not practicable:
1. By reason of nonrecurrent items included in income or because of
charges to surplus that might properly belong in the income account.
2. Because current results of subsidiaries are not accurately reflected
in the parent company’s statements.

---
**[Page 499]**

Analysis of the Income Account [447]
3. Because the depreciation and other amortization charges are irreg-
ularly computed.9
Special Dividends Paid by Subsidiaries. When earnings of non-
consolidated subsidiaries are allowed to accumulate in their surplus
accounts, they may be used later to bolster up the results of a poor year
by means of a large special dividend paid over to the parent company.
Examples:Such dividends, amounting to $11,000,000, were taken by the
Erie Railroad Company in 1922 from the Pennsylvania Coal Company and
Hillside Coal and Iron Company. The Northern Pacific Railway Company
similarly eked out its depleted earnings in 1930 and 1931 by means of large
sums taken as special dividends from the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy
Railroad Company, the Northern Express Company, and the Northwestern
Improvement Company, the last being a real-estate, coal and iron-ore sub-
sidiary. The 1931 earnings of the New Y ork, Chicago, and St. Louis Railroad
Company included a back dividend of some $1,600,000 on its holdings of
Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway Company Prior Preferred Stock, only a
part of which was earned in that year by the Wheeling road.
This device of concealing a subsidiary’s profits in good years and
drawing upon them in bad ones may seem quite praise-worthy as a
method of stabilizing the reported earning power. But such benevolent
deceptions are frowned upon by enlightened opinion, as illustrated by the
more recent regulations of the New Y ork Stock Exchange which insist
upon full disclosure of subsidiaries’ earnings. It is the duty of manage-
ment to disclose the truth and the whole truth about the results of each
period; it is the function of the stockholders to deduce the “normal earn-
ing power” of their company by averaging out the earnings of prosperity
and depression. Manipulation of the reported earnings by the manage-
ment even for the desirable purpose of maintaining them on an even keel
is objectionable none the less because it may too readily lead to manipu-
lation for more sinister reasons.
Distorted Earnings through Parent-subsidiary Relationships.
Examples are available of the use of the parent-subsidiary relationship to
produce astonishing distortions in the reported income. We shall give two
illustrations taken from the railroad field. These instances are the more
impressive because the stringent accounting regulations of the Interstate
9 Standard Statistics does not calculate per-share earnings if depreciation has not been deducted.

---
**[Page 500]**

Commerce Commission might be expected to prevent any misrepresen-
tation of earnings.
Examples: In 1925 Western Pacific Railroad Corporation paid divi-
dends of $7.56 upon its preferred stock and $5 upon its common stock.
Its income account showed earnings slightly exceeding the dividends
paid. These earnings consisted almost entirely of dividends aggregating
$4,450,000 received from its operating subsidiary, the Western Pacific
Railroad Company. The year’s earnings of the railroad, itself, however,
were only $2,450,000. Furthermore its accumulated surplus was insuffi-
cient to permit the larger dividend that the parent company desired to
report as its income for the year. To achieve this end, the parent company
went to the extraordinary lengths of donating the sum of $1,500,000 to
the operating company, and it immediately took the same money back as
a dividend from its subsidiary. The donation it charged against its surplus;
the receipt of the same money as dividends it reported as earnings. In this
devious fashion it was able to report $5 “earned” upon its common stock,
when in fact the applicable earnings were only about $2 per share.
In support of our previous statement that bad accounting practices
are contagious, we may point out that the Western Pacific example of
1925 was followed by the New Y ork, Chicago, and St. Louis Railroad
Company (“Nickel Plate”) in 1930 and 1931. The details are briefly as
follows:
In 1929 Nickel Plate sold, through a subsidiary, its holdings of Pere
Marquette stock to Chesapeake and Ohio, which was under the same con-
trol. A profit of $10,665,000 was realized on this sale, which gain was
properly credited to surplus. In 1930 Nickel Plate needed to increase its
income; whereupon it took the $10,665,000 profit out of its surplus,
returned it to the subsidiary’s treasury and then took $3,000,000 thereof
in the form of a “dividend” from this subsidiary, which it included in its
1930 income. A similar dividend of $2,100,000 was included in the
income account for 1931.
These extraordinary devices may have been resorted to for what was
considered the necessary purpose of establishing a net income large
enough to keep the company’s bonds legal for trust-fund investments.

The result, however, was the same as that from all other misleading
accounting practices, viz., to lead the public astray and to give those “on
the inside” an unfair advantage.
Broader Significance of Subsidiaries’ Losses. We have suggested
in this chapter that security analysis must make full allowance for the
results of subsidiaries, whether they be profits or losses. But the question
may well be raised: Is the loss of a subsidiary necessarily a direct offset
against the parent company’s earnings? Why should a company be worth
less because it owns something—in this case, an unprofitable interest?
Could it not at any time put an end to the loss by selling, liquidating or
even abandoning the subsidiary? Hence, if good management is assumed,
must we not also assume that the subsidiary losses are at most temporary
and therefore to be regarded as nonrecurring items rather than as deduc-
tions from normal earnings?
This point is similar to that discussed in the previous chapter relative
to idle-plant expense and similar also to the matter of unprofitable divi-
sions of a business, to be touched upon later. There is no one, simple
answer to the questions that we have raised. Actually, if the subsidiary
could be wound up without an adverse effect upon the rest of the business,
it would be logical to view such losses as temporary—since good sense
would dictate that in a short time the subsidiary must either become prof-
itable or be disposed of. But if there are important business relations
between the parent company and the subsidiary, e.g., if the latter affords
an outlet for goods or supplies cheap materials or absorbs an important
share of the overhead, then the termination of its losses is not so simple
a matter. It may turn out, upon further analysis, that all or a good part of
the subsidiary’s loss is a necessary factor in the parent company’s profit.
It is not an easy task to dete rmine just what business relationships are
Manual of Investments(Steam Railroads), 1931. The Wabash owned 99% of both the pre-
ferred and the common stock of the Ann Arbor. In December 1930 the Ann Arbor directors
declared a $5 dividend per share on the preferred and a $27 dividend per share on the com-
mon. This action was taken in the face of a working-capital deficit and net earnings available
of little over 10% of the dividends thus declared. Neither dividend was ever paid. This
maneuver, however, enabled the Wabash to credit its share of the dividends declared to its

involved in each instance. Like so many other elements in analysis, this
point usually requires an investigation going well beyond the reported
figures. The following examples will illustrate the type of situation and
analysis with which we have been dealing.
Example A: Purity Bakeries Corporation. This large maker of bread
and cake operates through a number of subsidiaries, of which one of the
largest is Cushman’s Sons, Inc., of New Y ork. Cushman’s has outstanding
$7 and $8 cumulative preferred stock, not guaranteed by Purity. The
annual reports of Purity are on a consolidated basis and show earnings
after deduction of full dividends on those Cushman’s preferred shares not
owned by Purity, whether earned or paid. The separate reports of Cush-
man’s reveal that between 1934 and 1937 its operations resulted in a 
considerable loss to Purity, on its accounting basis, viz.:

1937 $463 $426 $889

1934 209 173 382

Per share of Purity 0.36 0.71 1.06
The earnings are thus seen to be three times as large excluding Cush-
man’s as they were including Cushman’s. Could the analyst have reasoned
that the former provides the truer measure of Purity’s earning power, since
the company can be expected either again to earn money from that sub-
sidiary (as it had earned it in the past up to 1934) or to drop it? The ques-
tion of inter-corporate relationships would have to be considered. A note
in the 1937 report of Cushman’s indicated that Purity was making a fairly
large service charge in connection with its subsidiaries’ operations, which
suggests that Cushman’s might be of some extra value in absorbing over-
head. This matter would call for a careful inquiry.

Analysis of the Income Account [451]
But the report for the next year, 1938, showed, first, that Cushman’s
had earned the preferred dividend deduction, and secondly, that two
unprofitable retail plants (in Philadelphia and Chicago) had been closed.
Subject to further investigation, therefore, the analyst might well infer
that the subsidiary’s losses were nonpermanent in nature and that the
reported results for 1934–1937 are to be viewed with this point in mind.
Example B: Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company.This enterprise has
derived its income from various sources, chief of which has been the lease
of its railroad property to the Central Railroad of New Jersey for an
annual rental of $2,268,000. Its next largest holding consists of anthracite
coal mines, which since 1930 have been operated at a loss. In 1937 this
loss was equivalent to about 90 cents per share of Lehigh stock. As a result
the company reported a consolidatednet loss of $306,000 for the year, as
contrasted with a profit on a parent-company basis only of $1,125,000,
or 64 cents per share.
But in this case the analyst could not safely make the assumption that
the Lehigh stock was not worth less by reason of its ownership of the min-
ing properties than it would be worth without them. Operation of the
mines supplied an important tonnage to the railroad division. If the mines
were shut down, the ability of the Jersey Central to pay the annual rental
might have been critically impaired, especially since the lessee road had
been doing poorly for some years past. (In fact the claim was later made
by the Jersey Central that the Lehigh Coal and Navigation was obligated
in connection with the lease to supply a certain tonnage from its coal
properties). Hence, in this rather complicated set-up the investor could
not safely go behind the consolidated results, including the losses of the
anthracite subsidiary.
Example C: Barnsdall Oil Company. W e have here a situation oppo-
site from the other two. Barnsdall Oil owned both refining and produc-
ing properties, the latter profitable, the former unprofitable. In 1935 it
segregated the refineries (and marketing units) in a separate company, of
which it distributed the common stock to its own stockholders, retain-
ing, however, the preferred stock and substantial claims against the new
company. In 1936–1938 the refineries and stations continued to lose;
Barnsdall Oil advanced considerable sums to cover these losses and wrote
them off by charges first against capital surplus and then against earned
surplus. On the other hand, its income account, freed from the burden of

---
**[Page 504]**

these refining losses, showed profits from producing operations at a
steady rate from June 1, 1933, to the end of 1938.
In 1939, however, the New Y ork Stock Exchange called upon the com-
pany to correct its statements to stockholders by advising them of the
effect upon the reported profits of charging there-against the write-downs
of the investment in the refining company. These losses would have
reduced the indicated profits by more than one-third.
It is clear, from the standpoint of proper accounting, that as long as a
company continues to control an unprofitable division, its losses must be
shown as deductions from its other earnings. The analyst must decide
what the chances are of terminating the losses in the future, and view the
current price of the stock accordingly. The method followed by the Barns-
dall Oil Company appears therefore clearly open to criticism, since it
served merely to terminate the reporting of its refining losses without
really terminating the losses themselves. (At the end of 1939 the company
set steps into motion for an apparent complete divorcement and sale of
the refining and marketing divisions.)
Summary. To avoid leaving this point in confusion, we shall summa-
rize our treatment by suggesting:
1. In the first instance, subsidiary losses are to be deducted in every
analysis.
2. If the amount involved is significant, the analyst should investigate
whether or not the losses may be subject to early termination.
3. If the result of this examination is favorable, the analyst may consider
all or part of the subsidiary’s loss as the equivalent of a nonrecurring item.

Chapter 34
THE RELATION OF DEPRECIATION AND
SIMILAR CHARGES TO EARNING POWER
A CRITICAL analysis of an income account must pay particular attention
to the amounts deducted for depreciation and kindred charges. These
items differ from ordinary operating expenses in that they do not signify
a current and corresponding outlay of cash. They represent the estimated
shrinkage in the value of the fixed or capital assets, due to wearing out,
to using up or to their approaching extinction for whatever cause. The
important charges of this character may be classified as follows:
1. Depreciation (and obsolescence), replacements, renewals or retirements.
2. Depletion or exhaustion.
3. Amortization of leaseholds, leasehold improvements, licenses, etc.
4. Amortization of patents.
All these items may properly be embraced under the title “amortization, ”
but we shall sometimes refer to them generically as “depreciation items, ” or
simply as “depreciation, ” because the latter is a more familiar term.
Leading Questions Relative to Depreciation.The accounting the-
ory that governs depreciation charges is simple enough. If a capital asset
has a limited life, provision must be made to write off the cost of that asset
by charges against earnings distributed over the period of its life. But
behind this innocent statement lie complications of a threefold character.
First we find that accounting rules themselves may permit a value other
than cost as the base for the amortization charge. Second, we find many
ways in which companies fail to follow accepted accounting practice in
stating their depreciation deduction in the income account. Third, there
are occasions when an allowance that may be justified from an account-
ing standpoint will fail to meet the situation properly from an investment
standpoint. These problems will engage our attention in this and the next

two chapters. Our discussion will be directed first towards industrial com-
panies generally, following which we shall consider special aspects having
to do with oil companies, mining companies and public utilities.
1
THE DEPRECIATION BASE
Depreciation Base Other than Cost. There is support in account-
ing circles for the theory that the function of the depreciation allowance
is to provide for the replacement of the asset at the end of its life rather
than merely to write off its cost . If this idea were actually followed, the
current or expected future replacement cost would be the basis for the
depreciation charge, and it would vary not only with the value of the iden-
tical asset but also with changes in the character of the item that is
expected to replace the one worn out.
Whatever may be said for or against this theory,
2 it is virtually never
followed in the form stated. But we do meet in practice with a variant of
the idea, viz., the substitution of the replacement value of all the fixed
assets as of a given date in place of cost on the balance sheet, followed
usually by annual depreciation charges based on the new value.
Since 1914 there have been two waves of such revaluations. The first,
taking place in the 1920’s, marked up prewar costs to the higher values cur-
rently prevailing. The second, appearing in 1931–1933, marked down prop-
erty accounts to the much lower valuations associated with the depression.
3
Examples: In 1926 American Ice Company wrote up its fixed assets
by $7,868,000, and in 1935 it wrote them down correspondingly to restore
the valuations to a cost basis. The 1926 write-up resulted in larger depre-
ciation charges thereafter against income, and the 1935 reduction resulted
in lower depreciation charges. In 1933 American Locomotive Company
[454] SECURITY ANALYSIS
1 With a very few exceptions the railroads charge depreciation only on their equipment
(including this item in the maintenance charges). For the year 1937 Class I railroads charged
a total of $191,798,000 for depreciation of equipment and only $5,236,000 for depreciation
of way and structures.
2 In our view it is at once simpler and more logical to base depreciation on original cost.
Replacement cost should affect the accounts after replacement takes place (which may never
happen) rather than before.
3 See Fabricant, Solomon, “Revaluations of Fixed Assets, 1925–1934” (National Bureau of
Economic Research Bulletin 62, 1936), and Capital Consumption and Adjustment, National
Bureau of Economic Research, Chap. XII, 1938.

Analysis of the Income Account [455]
reduced the stated value of its stock from $50 to $5 a share and utilized
most of the capital surplus thus created to write down fixed properties by
nearly $26,000,000 and its investment in General Steel Castings Corpo-
ration by about $6,200,000. The net effect on the income account was to
reduce depreciation charges to about 40% of their former level.
There is some criticism in accounting circles of the propriety of such
sporadic changes in the depreciation base from original cost. In our opin-
ion they are not objectionable provided:
1. The new values are set up in the bona fide conviction that they 
represent existing realities more fairly than the old values.
2. Proper depreciation against these new values is charged in the income
account.
In many cases, however, we find that companies revaluing their fixed
assets fail to observe one or the other of these conditions.
Mark-downs to Reduce Depreciation Charges. Perhaps the most
striking phenomenon in the field of depreciation accounting is the recent
marking down of the fixed assets, not in the interests of conservatism but
with the precisely opposite intent of making a better earnings exhibit and
thereby increasing the apparent value of the shares.
We believe that it will be more convenient for the reader if we defer con-
sideration of the significance to security analysis of these devices until our
chapter devoted to “ Amortization Charges from the Investor’s Standpoint. ”
At this time, since we are dealing with accounting methods, we shall merely
remark that in our opinion excessive write-downs of fixed assets, for the
avowed or obvious purpose of decreasing depreciation and increasing
reported earnings, constitute an inexcusable subterfuge and should not be
condoned by the accounting profession. Registration statements submit-
ted to the S.E.C. include a statement of how much lower the earnings would
have been if the former plant values had been retained. We think that such
information should also appear as a footnote to the income account in the
annual reports to stockholders, but it would be better practice still if
accountants refused to certify a report containing such mark-downs and
insisted on restoration of the proper figures to the company’s accounts.
Balance Sheet–Income Account Discrepancies. Many corpora-
tions that have marked up their fixed assets fail to increase correspond-
ingly their depreciation charges against the income account. They are in

---
**[Page 508]**

effect attempting to get the benefit of the higher valuation in their balance
sheet without accepting the burden of consequently higher depreciation
charges against earnings. This practice has been especially prevalent in the
case of mining and oil companies. Two examples drawn from the general
industrial field are given here:
Examples: Hall Printing Company wrote up its property account by
$6,222,000 in 1926 and 1931, crediting this “appraisal increment” to cap-
ital surplus. Depreciation on this appreciated value was then charged to
capital surplus, instead of to income; e.g., typically, in the year ended
March 1938 the company charged $406,000 for such depreciation against
surplus and $864,000 for “regular” depreciation against income. In April
1938 the balance of the appraisal increment was eliminated by writing
down both property account and capital surplus; and the special depreci-
ation charge was then discontinued.
Borg Warner has been charging about $102,000 per annum since 1935
(and various amounts in prior years) to “ Appreciation Surplus, ” instead
of to income, to amortize a write-up of fixed assets made in 1927.
It should be obvious that no company should use one set of values for
its balance sheet and another for its income account. The more recent
tendency is to correct these disparities by eliminating the previous write-
up from the balance sheet, thus returning to original cost.
THE RATE OF DEPRECIATION. STANDARD 
AND NONSTANDARD PRACTICE
1. As Shown by Listing Statements. The vast majority of industrial
companies follow the standard policy of charging an appropriate depre-
ciation rate against each class of depreciable asset. The analyst can read-
ily check this fact by reference to New Y ork Stock Exchange listing
applications or to a prospectus or registration statement.
Examples: If standard methods are followed, they are likely to be
announced in somewhat the following manner:
(From listing application of Electric Storage Battery Company, dated
December 17, 1928.)
The policy of this Company in regard to depreciation … is as follows: On
buildings the term of life is twenty to thirty-three years, depending upon the
character of construction. Machinery, tools and fixtures are written off at the
rate of one to ten years, depending upon the character of the equipment.
[456]

**[Page 509]**

Analysis of the Income Account [457]
Office furniture and fixtures are written off in ten years. On all depreciable
properties rates are determined by actual experience and engineers’ estimates
as to the productive life of the equipment. In respect to depreciation of cur-
rent assets, a reserve is set aside to cover probable loss from bad debts.
(From the listing application of Midland Steel Products Company,
dated February 11, 1930.)
The following are the rates of depreciation used:

Tools and dies—amortized over life of job when number of units required can be
determined, otherwise written off at close of each fiscal year.
These rates have been used by the Company for several years, being standard
practice in the industry.
The rates are based upon the estimated life of the respective property involved.
Thus, with respect to buildings, the cost is depreciated, over 50 years; grounds,
driveways, and walks, over 50 years; machinery over 14 years; furniture and
fixtures, over 10 years; railroad sidings, over 50 years. No residual value at the
expiration of said periods is considered in determining the rates used.
In contrast with this standard policy, now all but universally followed,
we may point to the questionable practice on this important point for-
merly resorted to by such important companies as American Car and
Foundry, American Sugar Refining and Baldwin Locomotive Works.
The American Sugar Refining Company’s listing application, dated
December 6, 1923, contained the following statement:
The Company maintains a very liberal policy as to depreciation as shown by
the annual profit and loss statement of past years. The value of its properties
is at all times fully maintained by the making of all needful and proper repairs
thereto and renewals and replacements thereof.

---
**[Page 510]**

This declaration sounds reassuring, but it is far too indefinite to sat-
isfy the analyst. The actual depreciation charges, as shown in the follow-
ing record, disclose an unusually arbitrary and erratic policy.
[458] SECURITY ANALYSIS

1930 1,000,000 542,631
1931 1,000,000 None
1932 1,000,000 None
The additional charges to surplus made in the years 1926–1930, inclu-
sive, appear to strengthen our contention that American Sugar’s depreci-
ation allowances have been both arbitrary and inadequate.
The American Car and Foundry’s application, dated April 2, 1925,
contains the following:
The Company has no depreciation account as such. However, its equivalent
is found in the policy and the practice of the Company to maintain at all
times its plants and properties in first class physical condition and in a high
state of efficiency by repairing, renewing and replacing equipment and build-
ings as their physical conditions may require, and by replacing facilities with
those of more modern type, when such action results in more economical
production. This procedure amply covers depreciation and obsolescence and
the cost is charged to Operating Expenses.
Here again a sceptical attitude on the part of the analyst is “amply” war-
ranted. The same is true in respect of American Can which managed—
inexplicably—to avoid all reference to its depreciation policy in its listing

application dated February 26, 1926, although it did mention that the com-
pany had spent approximately $50,000,000 on extensions and improve-
ment of properties since February 1907 and that “during this period
properties have been depreciated by at least $20,000,000. ”
Baldwin Locomotive Works, in its listing application dated October 3,
1929, makes the following rather astonishing statement on depreciation:
The amount of the depreciation upon plant and equipment as determined
by the Federal Government for the five years 1924 to 1928 inclusive has
totaled $5,112,258.09 which has been deducted either from income or sur-
plus as follows:
Y ear From income From surplus Total depreciation
1924 $600,000 None $600,000.00
1925 None None None
1926 None None None
1927 1,000,000 $2,637,881.01 3,637,881.01
1928 600,000 274,377.08 874,377.08
$2,200,000 $2,912,258.09 $5,112,258.09
It is expected that in future years the amount of depreciation based upon the
estimated useful life of depreciable properties as determined by the Federal
Government, allowed by the Commissioner of Taxes as a proper deduction
from income and agreed to by our engineers, will govern the amount to be
used by the Works in its calculation of depreciation.
Evidently the income statements of Baldwin for this period were any-
thing but accurate. The average annual earnings per share of common
stock for 1924–1928, as reported to the stockholders, were strikingly
higher than the correct figure, as shown at the top of page 460.
2. As Shown by Comparisons of Two Companies.When the ana-
lyst knows that a company’s depreciation policy differs from the standard,
there is special reason to check the adequacy of the allowance. Comparison
with a single company in the same field may yield significant results, as is
shown by the table in the middle of page 460 respecting American Sugar
and American Car and Foundry.

Both comparatively and absolutely the depreciation allowances made

inadequate.4

§ Estimated at one-half of the expenditures for renewals and repairs. In the case of United States Steel for the period

4 For examples of insufficient charges and charges less than income tax deductions by
industrial companies see: Harbison-Walker Refractories Company charge of $296,000 
in 1936, termed “grossly inadequate” by new management and revised to $472,000; 
McKeesport Tin Plate Corporation report for 1937 stating that the charge on the income
tax return was $803,000 vs. $425,000 in statement to stockholders. Similarly, National
Enameling and Stamping Company for each year 1935–1937 charged about $185,000 in its
income account as contrasted with about $280,000 on its tax return. In 1938 insufficient
depreciation for 1933–1937 was cured by a charge of $443,000 to surplus. The auditors for
the Cudahy Packing Company stated in the certificate accompanying the 1939 report that
in their opinion the reserves for depreciation set up by the company in years prior to Oct.
29, 1938, were inadequate.

Analysis of the Income Account [461]
Depreciation Charges Often an Issue in Mergers. Comparative
depreciation charges at times become quite an issue in determining the
fairness of proposed terms of consolidation.
Example:In 1924 a merger plan was announced embracing the Chesa-
peake and Ohio, Hocking Valley, Pere Marquette, “Nickel Plate, ” and Erie
railroads. Some Chesapeake and Ohio stockholders dissented, and they
convinced the Interstate Commerce Commission that the terms of the
consolidation were highly unfair to their road. Among other matters they
pointed out that the earnings of Chesapeake and Ohio in the preceding
three years had in reality been much higher than stated, due to the unusu-
ally heavy charges made against them for depreciation and retirement of
equipment.
5 A similar objection was made in connection with the pro-
jected merger of Bethlehem Steel and Y oungstown Sheet and Tube in
1929, which plan was also defeated. Some figures on these two steel pro-
ducers are given as shown in the table on p. 462.
Concealed Depreciation. That nothing can be taken for granted in
security analysis is shown by the strange case of American Can, which
until 1937 had failed to reveal details of its depreciation policy to its
shareholders. During the years 1922–1936 it deducted anually a flat
$2,000,000 for this purpose. A comparison with Continental Can—
which charged about the same amount against a much smaller plant
investment—would have suggested that American Can’s earning power
had been overstated. But the annual report for 1934 disclosed to stock-
holders for the first time that the company had also been charging sums
to operating expenses for “replacements, ” without giving the amount.
The fact (but not the amounts) that such charges had been made in 1935
and 1936 was also revealed in those years. Meanwhile Form 10-K for
1935, filed with the S.E.C., revealed that the amount of these extra
Conversely, for cases of excessive depreciation, note: Depreciation charges of Acme Steel
for 1932–1935 were found by the federal government to have been $555,000 too high. This
amount, less income tax thereon of $104,000, was credited to surplus in 1936. (This is
almost the exact opposite of the National Enameling case.) Chicago Y ellow Cab Company in
1938 credited to surplus $483,000 for excess depreciation in former years.
5 Large expenditures made by Chesapeake and Ohio upon its equipment in 1926–1928 and
charged to operating expense were later claimed by the Interstate Commerce Commission 
to represent capital outlays. In 1933 this controversy was taken into the courts, and the 
Interstate Commerce Commission was sustained.

charges was about $2,400,000. Finally the annual report for 1937 advised
the stockholders that the corresponding extra charge-off amounted to
approximately $3,275,000 for the year 1936. Beginning with 1937 the
company made “regular” depreciation charges, amounting to $5,702,000
in that year and to $6,085,000 in 1938. Thus, by easy stages, the owners
of the business were told the facts of life bearing on their property.

In the light of this later disclosure, the earlier inference6 that Ameri-
can Can had understated its depreciation charges must give way to the
remark that the company had failed to reveal the facts.
A Case of Excessive Depreciation Charges Concealed by
Accounting Methods. The American Can example suggests compar-
ison with the earlier practice of National Biscuit Company, an enterprise
controlled largely by the same interests. For many years prior to 1922 the
company was constantly adding to the number of its factories, but its
property account failed to show any appreciable increase, except in the
single year 1920. The reports to stockholders were supremely ambiguous
on the matter of depreciation charges,
7 but according to the financial
manuals the company’s policy was as follows: “Depreciation is $300,000
per annum, and all items of replacement and building alterations are
charged direct to operating expense. ”
It is difficult to avoid the conclusion, however, that the capital invest-
ments in additional plants were actually being charged against the profits
6 Drawn in the 1934 edition of this book.
7 Prior to 1919, the company’s balance sheet each year stated its fixed assets “Less Deprecia-
tion Account—$300,000. ” Evidently this was the deduction for the current year and not the
amount accumulated.

and that the real earnings were in all probability much larger than those
reported to the public. Coincident with the issuance of seven shares of
stock for one and the tripling of the cash-dividend rate in 1922, this 
policy of understating earnings was terminated. The result was a sudden
doubling of the apparent earning power, accompanied by an equally 
sudden expansion in the plant account. The contrast between the two 
periods is shown forcibly in the table on this page.
Failure to State Depreciation Charges. Prior to the S.E.C. regula-
tion some of the important companies reported earnings after deprecia-
tion but failed to state the amount deducted for this purpose. Fortunately,
this information must now be supplied in the case of every registered
company.

AMORTIZATION CHARGES OF OIL 
AND MINING COMPANIES
These important sectors of the industrial field are subject to special fac-
tors bearing on amortization. In addition to depreciation in the ordinary
sense—which they usually calculate in the same way as do other compa-
nies
9 they must allow for depletion of their ore or oil reserves. In the case
of mining concerns there is also the factor of development expense. Oil
producers, on the other hand, have additional charges for intangible
drilling costs and for unproductive leases. These items are important in
their bearing on the true profits, and they are troublesome because of the
varying methods that are followed by different enterprises.
Depletion Charges of Mining Companies. Depletion represents
the using up of capital assets by turning them into products for sale. It
applies to companies producing metals, oil and gas, sulphur, timber, etc.
As the holdings, or reserves, of these products are exhausted, their value
must gradually be written off through charges against earnings. In the case
of the older mining companies (including particularly the copper and sul-
phur producers) the depletion charges are determined by certain techni-
cal requirements of the federal income tax law, which rest upon the
amount and value of the reserves as they were supposed to exist on March
1, 1913, or by applying certain percentages to the value of the product.
Because of the artificial base used in these computations, many compa-
nies have omitted the depletion charge from their reports to stockholders.
Independent Calculation by Investor Necessary.As we shall show
later, the investor in a mining concern must ordinarily compute his own
depletion allowance, based upon the amount that he has paidfor his share
of the mining property. Consequently a depletion charge based either on
the company’s original book cost or on the special figure set up for
income-tax purposes would be confusing rather than helpful. The omis-
sion of the depletion charge of mining companies is not to be criticized,
therefore; but the stockholder in such enterprises must be well aware 
of the fact in studying their reports. Furthermore, in any comparison of
[464] SECURITY ANALYSIS
9 However, the cost of equipment and materials on oil-producing propertiesis often written
off through the depletion charge (which is based on the barrels produced) instead of the
depreciation account (which is based on the time elapsing).

**[Page 517]**

Analysis of the Income Account [465]
mining companies a proper distinction must be drawn between those
which do and those which do not deduct their depletion charges in
reporting their earnings. Following are some examples of companies that
pursue one or the other policy:
Companies That Report Earnings Companies That Report Earnings
without Deduction for Depletion: after Deduction for Depletion:
Alaska Juneau Gold Mining Co. Cerro de Pasco Copper Corp.
Anaconda Copper Mining Co. Granby Consolidated Mining, etc., Co. (copper)
Dome Mines, Ltd. (gold) Homestake Mining Co. (gold)
Kennecott Copper Corp. International Nickel Co. of Canada, Ltd.
Noranda Mines, Ltd. (copper and gold) Patino Mines, etc. (tin)
Texas Gulf Sulphur Co. Phelps Dodge Corp. (copper)
St. Joseph Lead Co.
Depletion and Similar Charges in the Oil Industry. In the oil
industry depletion charges are more closely related to the actual cost of
doing business than in the case of mining enterprises. The latter ordinar-
ily invest in a single property or group of properties, the cost of which is
then written off over a fairly long period of years. But the typical large oil
producer normally spends substantial sums each year on new leases and
new wells. These additional holdings are needed to make up for the
shrinkage of reserves through production. The depletion charge corre-
sponds in some measure, therefore, to a current cash outlay for the pur-
pose of maintaining reserves and production. New wells may yield as high
as 80% of their total output during the first year. Hence nearly all the cost
of such “flush production” must be written off in a single fiscal period,
and most of the “earnings” from this source are in reality a return of the
capital expended thereon. If the investment is not written off rapidly
through depletion and other charges, the profit and the value of the prop-
erty account will both be grossly overstated. In the case of an oil company
actively engaged in development work, the various headings under which
write-offs must be made include the following:
1. Depreciation of tangible assets.
2. Depletion of oil and gas reserves, based upon the cost of the leases.
3. Unprofitable leases written off. Part of the acquisitions and explo-
ration will always prove totally valueless and must be charged against the
revenue from the productive leases.

---
**[Page 518]**

4. Intangible drilling costs.These are either written off at one time, as
equivalent to an operating expense, or amortized over the life of the well.
Example: The case of Marland Oil in 1926 illustrates the extent to
which reported earnings of oil companies are dependent upon the
accounting policies with respect to amortization. This company spent
large sums annually on new leases and wells to maintain its rate of pro-
duction. Prior to 1926 it charged the so-called “intangible drilling costs”
to capital account and then wrote them off against earnings through an
annual amortization charge. In 1926 Marland adopted the more conser-
vative policy of charging off all these “intangible costs” currently against
earnings. The effect on profits is shown in the following table.

In the past ten years significant changes have occurred in the policies
followed by the important oil companies. Prior to the depression the gen-
eral tendency was towards charging the “intangible drilling costs” to earn-
ings—as shown in the change made by Marland in 1926. But since the
depression many of the large companies have switched over to the less con-
servative basis of capitalizing these costs, subject to annual amortization.
10
This change seems justified in good part by the wide adoption of state pro-
ration laws, which effectively spread out the total production of a new well
over many years instead of concentrating it within a relatively few months.
This makes an oil well a fairly long-term capital asset, so that charging off
a good part of its cost (now often running to very high figures) against a
single year’s profits would be unduly severe.
The companies have also aided their earnings by large write-downs
of fixed assets, with corresponding reductions in the annual amortization

Analysis of the Income Account [467]
charges against them. This practice has perhaps been more widespread
among oil companies than in any other industrial group. Some produc-
ers have also switched their charges for property retirements from earn-
ings to the depreciation reserve. Finally, we have examples of a reduction
in amortization charge being brought about by adoption of an “over-all
basis” instead of a lease basis for depletion. By this means, oil produced
from high-cost leases is written off not at its actual cost but at the aver-
age cost of all the oil reserves owned.
The significance of these changes in accounting policy is illustrated
by the following:
11
Examples: Gulf Oil Corporation increased its 1932 earnings by
$3,621,000, by capitalizing intangible drilling costs instead of charging
them off, as formerly.
Socony-Vacuum increased its 1932 earnings by $6,095,000 (and sub-
sequent earnings correspondingly) as a result of a write-down of fixed
assets with consequent reduction in depreciation charges. In 1935 its prof-
its were increased $1,376,000 by charging this sum—representing losses
on certain retired property—to depreciation reserve instead of to income,
as theretofore. In 1936 it began to capitalize intangible drilling costs,
adding about $8,850,000 to profits in that year through this change. In
1937 the company made a further revision in its depreciation policy
(apparently intended to place it on the standard basis), which added some
$2,500,000 to that year’s profits.
Pure Oil Company reduced its 1934 depletion charges and increased
its earnings by $1,698,000 through adoption of the “over-all” basis.
The Meaning of These Variations to the Analyst and the
Investor. These differences of accounting methods are highly confus-
ing and may arouse some resentment in the investor. We must recognize,
however, that most of them are technically admissible, in that they rep-
resent choices between the ordinary and the more conservative basis of
amortizing the fixed assets. What is called for, in consequence, is not so
much censure as sound interpretation.
Suggested Standards. The analyst should seek to apply a uniform and
reasonably conservative rate of amortization to a property base that
11 These examples are drawn largely from Alfred Braunthal, “ Are Oil Earnings Reports 
Fictitious?” Barron’s, Mar. 8, 1937.

**[Page 520]**

reflects the realities of the proposed investment. We suggest the follow-
ing standards, in so far as it may be feasible to apply them:
1. Depreciation on Tangible Assets.This should always be taken at the
well-established rates, applied to cost—or to a figure substantially less
than cost only if the facts clearly justify the write-down.
2. Intangible Drilling Costs. We believe that capitalizing these costs,
and then writing them off as oil is produced—although less “conserva-
tive”—is the preferable basis both for comparative purposes and to sup-
ply a fair reflection of current earnings. In comparing companies that use
one and the other method, the analyst must make the best allowance he
can for the understatement of earnings by the companies that charge off
100% the first year.
Example: The difficulty of making this adjustment in practice may
be shown by comparing the 1938 reports of Continental Oil Company
and Ohio Oil Company. These two concerns are roughly similar in
their set-up. Both produced about 20 million barrels in 1938; Conti-
nental Oil refined about two-thirds, and Ohio Oil about one-third its
output. Continental charges all its intangible drilling costs direct to
income, while Ohio capitalizes these costs and writes them off over the
life of the wells.
It might be expected that the total amortization charges of Continen-
tal, including drilling expense on the 100% basis, would be relatively
higher than those of Ohio. Y et in 1938 Ohio charged off $11,602,000, or
21
1/2% of its $54 million sales; while Continental charged off $14,038,000,
or 17.6% of its $80 million gross. Apparently no adjustment would be
needed by the analyst to equalize the two accounting methods. The rea-
sons may be found in several circumstances; e.g., (a) after a number of
years the gradual write-off method approximates the 100% method, since
amortization of old drilling expense becomes continuously greater. (b) In
the case of Continental, this concern wrote down its property account in
1932 by some $45,000,000 and thus reduced its normal depreciation and
depletion charges considerably in succeeding years.
3. Property Retirement and Abandoned Leases. We think that loss on
property retired (in excess of depreciation already accrued) should be
charged against the year’s earnings, rather than against surplus as is done
by most companies in other fields. The reason is that property retirements
are likely to be a normal and recurrent factor in the business of a large,
[468] SECURITY ANALYSIS

---
**[Page 521]**

Analysis of the Income Account [469]
integrated oil company, instead of happening only sporadically as in other
lines. Abandoned leases come under this general heading, and the loss
thereon should be charged to earnings.
4. Depletion of Oil Reserves. The proper theoretical principle here is
that the analyst should allow for depletion on the basis at which the oil
reserves are valued in the market. This point, as applied to amortization
generally, will be discussed in the next chapter. It implies, as we shall see,
that what may be the correct accounting basis for computing depletion
may not be the most suitable basis for the analysis of investment values.
Unfortunately, business practice in the oil industry has been such as to
make the sound application of this principle exceedingly difficult. The oil-
producing part of the industry has apparently accounted for most of the
profits; the refining and marketing divisions have earned little, if anything,
on their investment. If earnings were the criterion of value here, most of
the market price of a typical oil stock would be ascribable to the produc-
ing division, and on this basis a comparatively high depletion charge
against each barrel taken out would be called for. On the other hand, if the
division were made in proportion to book values, the refining and market-
ing sections would loom large, the oil reserves would have a much smaller
value, and the depletion charge would be proportionately smaller.
We do not see any really satisfactory answer to the dilemma that we
have posed—for it seems to us that the partition of earning power in the
industry between production and the other branches is an essentially arti-
ficial one and cannot be viewed as permanent. We therefore are led to 
suggest the following practical compromisewith the problem:
1. In the case of integratedoil companies, accept the company’s deple-
tion figure as the best available. (This includes acceptance of the “over-
all” basis, if used, since this method would seem to reflect the facts fairly.)
However, any charges for depletion made against an “appreciation”
account in the balance sheet should be deducted from income.
2. In the case of companies that are solely oil producers, or virtually
so, the analyst can compute what the market is payingfor the total devel-
oped oil reserves (if an estimate of these is published). Hence he can make
his own depletion calculation, for the particular purpose of his analysis,
in such an instance in the same manner as in the case of a mining propo-
sition. (For a calculation of this kind applied to Texas Gulf Producing
Company see p. 502 on accompanying CD.)

**[Page 522]**

OTHER TYPES OF AMORTIZATION 
OF CAPITAL ASSETS
Leaseholds and Leasehold Improvements. The ordinary lease
involves no capital investment by the lessee, who merely undertakes to
pay rent in return for the use of property. But if the rental payments are
considerably less than the use of the property is worth, and if the arrange-
ment has a considerable period to run, the leasehold—as it is called—may
have a substantial value. Oil lands are leased on a standard basis for a roy-
alty amounting usually to one-eighth of the production. Leaseholds on
which a substantial output is developed or assured are worth a large
bonus above the rental payments involved, and they are bought and sold
in the same way as the fee ownership of the property. Similar bonuses are
paid—in boom times usually—for long-term leases on urban real estate.
If a company has paid money for a leasehold, the cost is regarded as 
a capital investment that should be written off during the life of the lease.
(In the case of an oil lease the write-off is made against each barrel pro-
duced, rather than on a time basis, since the output declines rapidly from
the initial flush figure.) These charges are in reality part of the rent paid for
the property and must obviously be included in current operating expense.
When structures are built on leased property or alterations made or
fixtures installed, they are designated as “leasehold improvements. ” Hence
their cost must be written down to nothing during the life of the lease,
since they belong to the landlord when the lease expires. The annual
charge-off for this purpose is called “amortization of leasehold improve-
ments. ” It partakes to some extent of the nature of a depreciation charge.
Chain-store enterprises frequently invest considerable sums in such lease-
hold improvements, and consequently the annual write-offs thereof may
be of appreciable importance in their income accounts.
Example: The December 31, 1938, balance sheet of F .W . Woolworth
Company carried “Buildings Owned and Improvements on Leased
Premises to be amortized over periods of leases” at a net valuation of
$46,717,000. The charge against 1938 earnings for amortization of these
buildings and leasehold improvements amounted to $3,925,283.
Since these items belong to the amortization group, they lend them-
selves to the same kind of arbitrary treatment as do the others. By mak-
ing the annual charge against surplus instead of income or by writing
[470] SECURITY ANALYSIS

---
**[Page 523]**

Analysis of the Income Account [471]
down the entire capital investment to $1 and thus eliminating the annual
charge entirely, a corporation can exclude these items of operating cost
from its reported per-share earnings and thus make the latter appear
deceptively large.
Amortization of Patents. In theory, a patent should be dealt with in
exactly the same way as a mining property; i.e. , its cost to the investor
should be written off against earnings during its remaining life. It is obvi-
ous, therefore, that charges made against earnings by the company—
which are based on the book value of the patent—have ordinarily little
relevance to the real situation. Consideration of this question belongs
chiefly to a later chapter on amortization from the investor’s standpoint,
and to avoid dividing our treatment we shall postpone to the same place
our brief discussion of the accounting methods relative to patents
encountered in corporate reports.
Amortization of Good-will. This is a matter of very minor impor-
tance. A few companies have followed the rather extraordinary policy of
charging off their good-will account against earnings in a number of
annual installments.
Examples: Radio Corporation of America charged $310,000 a year for
this purpose between 1934 and 1937. This was applicable to the good-
will account of its subsidiary National Broadcasting Company and was
discontinued in 1938, although $1,876,000 remained unamortized.
Obviously, this practice has no factual basis, since good-will has no
duration of life apart from that of the business as a whole. Where the item
is of any size, the analyst should adjust the earnings by canceling the charge.
See accompanying CD for Chapter 35, “Public-utility
Depreciation Policies, ” and Chapter 36, “Amortization
Charges from the Investor’s Standpoint. ”

Chapter 37
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
EARNINGS RECORD
IN THE LAST SIX CHAPTERS our attention was devoted to a critical examina-
tion of the income account for the purpose of arriving at a fair and inform-
ing statement of the results for the period covered. The second main
question confronting the analyst is concerned with the utility of this past
record as an indicator of future earnings. This is at once the most important
and the least satisfactory aspect of security analysis. It is the most important
because the sole practical value of our laborious study of the past lies in the
clue it may offer to the future; it is the least satisfactory because this clue is
never thoroughly reliable and it frequently turns out to be quite valueless.
These shortcomings detract seriously from the value of the analyst’s work,
but they do not destroy it. The past exhibit remains a sufficiently depend-
able guide, in a sufficient proportion of cases, to warrant its continued use
as the chief point of departure in the valuation and selection of securities.
The Concept of Earning Power.The concept of earning powerhas a
definite and important place in investment theory. It combines a statement
of actual earnings, shown over a period of years, with a reasonable expecta-
tion that these will be approximated in the future, unless extraordinary con-
ditions supervene. The record must cover a number of years, first because a
continued or repeated performance is always more impressive than a single
occurrence and secondly because the average of a fairly long period will tend
to absorb and equalize the distorting influences of the business cycle.
A distinction must be drawn, however, between an average that is the
mere arithmetical resultant of an assortment of disconnected figures and
an average that is “normal” or “modal, ” in the sense that the annual results
show a definite tendency to approximate the average. The contrast
between one type of earning power and the other may be clearer from
the following examples:

Analysis of the Income Account [473]
The average earnings of about $4.50 per share shown by S. H. Kress and
Company can truly be called its “indicated earning power, ” for the reason
that the figures of each separate year show only moderate variations from
this norm. On the other hand the Hudson Motors average of $4.75 per share
is merely an abstraction from ten widely varying figures, and there was no
convincing reason to believe that the earnings from 1933 onward would bear
a recognizable relationship to this average. A similar conclusion was drawn
from our discussion of the exhibit of J. I. Case Company on page 65.
These conclusions, reached in 1933, are supported by the results of
the six years following:

Quantitative Analysis Should Be Supplemented by Qualitative
Considerations. In studying earnings records an important principle
of security analysis must be borne in mind:
Quantitative data are useful only to the extent that they are supported by a
qualitative survey of the enterprise.
In order for a company’s business to be regarded as reasonably stable,
it does not suffice that the past record should show stability . The nature
of the undertaking, considered apart from any figures, must be such as to
indicate an inherent permanence of earning power. The importance of this
additional criterion was well illustrated by the case of the Studebaker Cor-
poration which was used as an example in our discussion of qualitative
factors in analysis on page 87. It is possible, on the other hand, that there
may be considerable variation in yearly earnings, but there is a reasonable
basis nevertheless for taking the average as a rough index at least of future
performance. In 1934 we cited United States Steel Corporation as a lead-
ing case in point. The text of our discussion was as follows:
The annual earnings for 1923–1932 are given below.

Analysis of the Income Account [475]
If compared with those of Studebaker for 1920–1929, the foregoing
earnings show much greater instability. Y et the average of about $8 per
share for the ten-year period has far more significance as a guide to the
future than had Studebaker’s indicated earning power of about $6.75 per
share. This greater dependability arises from the entrenched position of
United States Steel in its industry; and also from the relatively narrow
fluctuations in both the annual output and the profit per ton over most
of this period. These two elements may be used as a basis for calculating
approximate “normal earnings” of U. S. Steel, somewhat as follows:
Normal or usual annual production of finished goods  . . . . . . . . . . . 13,000,000 tons
Gross receipts per ton of finished products  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $100.00
Net earnings per ton before depreciation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $12.50
Net earnings on 13,000,000 tons  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $160,000,000.00
Depreciation, bond interest, and preferred dividends  . . . . . . . . . . . . 90,000,000.00
Balance for 8,700,000 shares of common  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 70,000,000.00
Normal earnings per share  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $8.00
The average earnings for the 1923–1932 decade are thus seen to
approximate a theoretical figure based upon a fairly well-defined “nor-
mal” output and profit margin. (The increase in number of shares out-
standing prevents this normal figure from exceeding the ten-year
average.) Although a substantial margin of error must be allowed for in
such a computation, it at least supplies a starting point for an intelligent
estimate of future probabilities.
Examining this analysis six years later, we may draw some conflicting
conclusions as to its value. United States Steel’s earnings did recover 
to $7.88 per share in 1937 ($8.31 before the surtax on undistributed 
profits). The price advanced from the 1933 average of 45
1/2 to a high of
126 in March 1937. Hence our implication that the company had a 
better earning power than the 1932 results and stock prices reflected
would seem to have been amply justified by the event.
But actually the average earnings for 1934–1939 have been quite dis-
appointing (amounting to no more than 14 cents per share). If these
results have as much validity for the steel industry as they have for most
lines of business, we should have to admit that the analysis based on
1923–1932 was not really useful, because the underlying conditions in
steel have changed for the worse. (The change consists chiefly in much

higher unit costs and a lower average output, selling prices on the whole
having been well maintained.1)
Current Earnings Should Not Be the Primary Basis of
Appraisal. The market level of common stocks is governed more by
their current earnings than by their long-term average. This fact accounts
in good part for the wide fluctuations in common-stock prices, which
largely (though by no means invariably) parallel the changes in their earn-
ings between good years and bad. Obviously the stock market is quite
irrational in thus varying its valuation of a company proportionately with
the temporary changes in its reported profits.
2 A private business might
easily earn twice as much in a boom year as in poor times, but its owner
would never think of correspondingly marking up or down the value of
his capital investment.
This is one of the most important lines of cleavage between Wall Street
practice and the canons of ordinary business. Because the speculative
public is clearly wrong in its attitude on this point, it would seem that its
errors should afford profitable opportunities to the more logically minded
to buy common stocks at the low prices occasioned by temporarily
reduced earnings and to sell them at inflated levels created by abnormal
prosperity.
The Classical Formula for “Beating the Stock Market. ” We have here
the long-accepted and classical formula for “beating the stock market. ”
Obviously it requires strength of character in order to think and to act in
opposite fashion from the crowd and also patience to wait for opportu-
nities that may be spaced years apart. But there are still other considera-
tions that greatly complicate this apparently simple rule for successful
[476] SECURITY ANALYSIS
1 It may be interesting to note that our 1933 conclusions as to the earning power of United
States Steel are quite similar to those reached by J. B. Williams in his elaborate study of this
company contained in his book The Theory of Investment Value, pp. 409–462. But note also,
as against the foregoing indication of normal earning power, the rather pessimistic implica-
tions of the longer range study of United States Steel’s position on pp. 607–611 below. The
company’s failure to reestablish this earning power in 1934–1939 might suggest that the lat-
ter analysis deserved the greater weight.
2 The rise of United States Steel to 126 in March 1937, already mentioned, is a striking exam-
ple of this folly of the stock market. It was based on a single good year, following six bad or
mediocre ones. Within twelve months the price had declined to 42—a loss of two-thirds of its
quotation, and over $730,000,000 in aggregate market value for this single issue. The range of
Y oungstown Sheet and Tube and Jones and Laughlin Steel in that period was even wider.

Analysis of the Income Account [477]
operations in stocks. In actual practice the selection of suitable buying
and selling levels becomes a difficult matter. Taking the long market cycle
of 1921–1933, an investor might well have sold out at the end of 1925 and
remained out of the market in 1926–1930 and bought again in the depres-
sion year 1931. The first of these moves would later have seemed a bad
mistake of judgment, and the last would have had most disturbing con-
sequences. In other market cycles of lesser amplitude such serious mis-
calculations are not so likely to occur, but there is always a good deal of
doubt with regard to the correct time for applying the simple principle of
“buy low and sell high. ”
It is true also that underlying values may change substantially from
one market cycle to another, more so, of course, in the case of individual
issues than for the market as a whole. Hence if a common stock is sold at
what seems to be a generous price in relation to the average of past earn-
ings, it may later so improve its position as to justify a still higher quota-
tion even in the next depression. The converse may occur in the purchase
of securities at subnormal prices. If such permanent changes did not fre-
quently develop, it is doubtful if the market would respond so vigorously
to current variations in the business picture. The mistake of the market
lies in its assumption that in every case changes of this sort are likely to
go farther, or at least to persist, whereas experience shows that such devel-
opments are exceptional and that the probabilities favor a swing of the
pendulum in the opposite direction.
The analyst cannot follow the stock market in its indiscriminate 
tendency to value issues on the basis of current earnings. He may on occa-
sion attach predominant weight to the recent figures rather than to the
average, but only when persuasive evidence is at hand pointing to the 
continuance of these current results.
Average vs. Trend of Earnings. In addition to emphasizing strongly
the current showing of a company, the stock market attaches great weight
to the indicated trend of earnings. In Chap. 27 we pointed out the twofold
danger inhering in this magnification of the trend—the first being that the
supposed trend might prove deceptive, and the second being that valua-
tions based upon trend obey no arithmetical rules and therefore may too
easily be exaggerated. There is indeed a fundamental conflict between the
concepts of the average and of the trend, as applied to an earnings record.
This may be illustrated by the following simplified example:

---
**[Page 530]**

On the basis of these figures the better the trend, when compared with
the same current earnings (in this case $7 per share), the poorer the aver-
age and the higher the average the poorer the trend. They suggest an
important question respecting the theoretical and practical interpretation
of earnings records: Is not the trend at least as significant for the future as
the average? Concretely, in judging the probable performance of Compa-
nies A and C over the next five years, would not there be more reason to
think in terms of a sequence of $8, $9, $10, $11, and $12 for A and a
sequence of $7, $6, $5, $4, and $3 for C rather than in terms of the past
average of $4 for A and $10 for C?
The answer to this problem derives from common sense rather than
from formal or a priori logic. The favorable trend of Company A’s results
must certainly be taken into account, but not by a mere automatic projec-
tion of the line of growth into the distant future. On the contrary, it must
be remembered that the automatic or normal economic forces militate
againstthe indefinite continuance of a given trend.
3 Competition, regula-
tion, the law of diminishing returns, etc., are powerful foes to unlimited
expansion, and in smaller degree opposite elements may operate to check
a continued decline. Hence instead of taking the maintenance of a favor-
able trend for granted—as the stock market is wont to do—the analyst
must approach the matter with caution, seeking to determine the causes
of the superior showing and to weigh the specific elements of strength in
the company’s position against the general obstacles in the way of contin-
ued growth.
Attitude of Analyst Where Trend Is Upward.If such a qualitativestudy
leads to a favorable verdict—as frequently it should—the analyst’s philos-
ophy must still impel him to base his investment valuation on an assumed
earning power no larger than the company has already achieved in a

period of normal business. This is suggested because, in our opinion,
investment values can be related only to demonstrated performance; so
that neither expected increases nor even past results under conditions of
abnormal business activity may be taken as a basis. As we shall point out
in the next chapter, this assumed earning power may properly be capital-
ized more liberally when the prospects appear excellent than in the ordi-
nary case, but we shall also suggest that the maximum multiplier be held
to a conservative figure (say, 20, under the conditions of 1940) if the val-
uation reached is to be kept within strictly investmentlimits. On this basis,
assuming that general business conditions in the current year are not
unusually good, the earning power of Company A might be taken at 
$7 per share, and its investment value might be set as high as 140.
4 The
divergence in method between the stock market and the analyst—as we
define his viewpoint—would mean in general that the price levels ruling
for the so-called “good stocks” under normal market conditions are likely
to appear overgenerous to the conservative student. This does not mean
that the analyst is convinced that the market valuation is wrong but rather
that he is not convinced that its valuation is right. He would call a sub-
stantial part of the price a “speculative component, ” in the sense that it 
is paid not for demonstrated but for expected results. (This subject is 
discussed further in Chap. 39.)
Attitude of Analyst Where Trend Is Downward. Where the trend has
been definitely downward, as that of Company C, the analyst will assign
great weight to this unfavorable factor. He will not assume that the down-
curve must presently turn upward, nor can he accept the past average—
which is much higher than the current figure—as a normal index of future
earnings. But he will be equally chary about any hasty conclusions to the
effect that the company’s outlook is hopeless, that its earnings are certain to
disappear entirely and that the stock is therefore without merit or value. Here
again a qualitative study of the company’s situation and prospects is essen-
tial to forming an opinion whether at some price, relatively low, of course,
the issue may not be a bargain, despite its declining earnings trend. Once
more we identify the viewpoint of the analyst with that of a sensible busi-
ness man looking into the pros and cons of some privately owned enterprise.

tive viewpoint on this matter expressed by us in the 1934 edition of this work and the rea-
sons for the change.

To illustrate this reasoning, we append the record of net earnings for
1925–1933 of Continental Baking Corporation and American Laundry
Machinery Company.
[480] SECURITY ANALYSIS
Continental American Laundry 
Y ear Baking Machinery
1933 $2,788,000 $1,187,000(d)
1932 2,759,000 986,000(d)
1931 4,243,000 772,000

1926 6,547,000 4,807,000
1925 8,794,000 5,101,000
The profits of American Laundry Machinery reveal an uninterrupted
decline, and the trend shown by Continental Baking is almost as bad. It
will be noted that in 1929—the peak of prosperity for most companies—
the profits of these concerns were substantially less than they were four
years earlier.
Wall Street reasoning would be prone to conclude from this exhibit
that both enterprises are definitely on the downward path. But such
extreme pessimism would be far from logical. A study of these two busi-
nesses from the qualitative standpoint would indicate first that the respec-
tive industries are permanent and reasonably stable and secondly that
each company occupies a leading position in its industry and is well for-
tified financially. The inference would properly follow that the unfavor-
able tendency shown during 1925–1932 was probably due to accidental
or nonpermanent conditions and that in gaging the future earning power
more enlightenment will be derived from the substantial average than
from the seemingly disastrous trend.
5
Deficits a Qualitative, Not a Quantitative Factor. When a com-
pany reports a deficit for the year, it is customary to calculate the amount
in dollars per share or in relation to interest requirements. The statistical
5 The results since 1933 would tend to bear out this earlier conclusion, at least in part.

Analysis of the Income Account [481]
manuals will state, for example, that in 1932 United States Steel Corpo-
ration earned its bond-interest “deficit 12.40 times” and that it showed a
deficit of $11.08 per share on its common stock. It should be recognized
that such figures, when taken by themselves, have no quantitative signif-
icance and that their value in forming an average may often be open to
serious question.
Let us assume that Company A lost $5 per share of common in the
last year and Company B lost $7 per share. Both issues sell at 25. Is this
an indication of any sort that Company Astock is preferable to Company
B stock? Obviously not; for assuming it were so, it would mean that the
more shares there were outstanding the more valuable each share would
be. If Company Bissues 2 shares for 1, the loss would be reduced to $3.50
per share, and on the assumption just made, each new share would then
be worth more than an old one. The same reasoning applies to bond
interest. Suppose that Company A and Company B each lost $1,000,000
in 1932. Company A has $4,000,000 of 5% bonds and Company B has
$10,000,000 of 5% bonds. Company A would then show interest earned
“deficit 5 times” and Company B would earn its interest “deficit 2 times. ”
These figures should not be construed as an indication of any kind that
Company A’s bonds are less secure than Company B’s bonds. For, if so, it
would mean that the smaller the bond issue the poorer its position—a
manifest absurdity.
When an average is tak en o v er a period tha t incl udes a n um ber o f
deficits, some question must arise as to whether or not the resultant figure
is really indicative of the earning power. For the wide variation in the indi-
vidual figures must detract from the representative character of the aver-
age. This point is of considerable importance in view of the prevalence of
deficits during the depression of the 1930’s. In the case of most companies
the average of the years since 1933 may now be thought more representa-
tive of indicated earning power than, say, a ten-year average 1930–1939.
6
Intuition Not a Part of the Analyst’s Stock in Trade. In the
absence of indications to the contrary we accept the past record as a basis
for judging the future. But the analyst must be on the lookout for any such

1934–1939 fairly reflect the future earning power of companies in the heavy industries, e.g.,

**[Page 534]**

indications to the contrary. Here we must distinguish between vision or
intuition on the one hand, and ordinary sound reasoning on the other.
The ability to see what is coming is of inestimable value, but it cannot be
expected to be part of the analyst’s stock in trade. (If he had it, he could
dispense with analysis.) He can be asked to show only that moderate
degree of foresight which springs from logic and from experience intel-
ligently pondered. It was not to be demanded of the securities statistician,
for example, that he foretell the enormous increase in cigarette consump-
tion since 1915 or the decline in the cigar business or the astonishing sta-
bility of the snuff industry; nor could he have predicted—to use another
example—that the two large can companies would be permitted to enjoy
the full benefits from the increasing demand for their product, without
the intrusion of that demoralizing competition which ruined the profits
of even faster growing industries, e.g., radio.
Analysis of the Future Should Be Penetrating Rather than Prophetic.
Analytical reasoning with regard to the future is of a somewhat different
character, being penetrating rather than prophetic.
7
Example: Let us take the situation presented by Intertype Corporation
in March-July 1939, when the stock was selling at $8 per share. This old,
established company was one of the leaders in a relatively small industry
(line-casting machines, etc., for the printing trade). Its recent earnings
had not been favorable, nor did there seem to be any particular reason
for optimistic expectations as to the near-term outlook. The analyst, how-
ever, could not fail to be impressed by the balance sheet, which showed
net current assets available for the stock amounting to close to $20 per
share. The ten-year earnings, dividend and price record of the common
stock was as shown in the table on p. 483.
Certainly there is nothing attractive in this record, marked as it is by
irregularity and the absence of a favorable trend. But although these facts
would undoubtedly condemn the issue in the eyes of the speculator, the
reasoning of the analyst might conceivably run along different lines.
The essential question for him would be whether or not the company
can be counted on to remain in business and to participate about as before
in good times and bad. On this point consideration of the industry, the

Analysis of the Income Account [483]
company’s prominent position in it and the strong financial set-up would
clearly suggest an affirmative answer. If this were granted, the analyst
would then point out that the shares could be bought at 8 with very small
chance of ultimate loss and with every indication that under the next set
of favorable conditions the value of the stock would double. Note that in
3 years out of the past 5 and in 6 out of the past 10, the stock sold between
2 and 4 times the July 1939 price.
This type of reasoning, it will be noted, lays emphasis not upon an accu-
rate prediction of future trends but rather on reaching the general conclu-
sion that the company will continue to do business pretty much as before.
Wall Street is inclined to doubt that any such presumption may be
applied to companies with an irregular trend, and to consider that it is
just as difficult and hazardous to reach a conclusion of this kind as to
determine that a “growing company” will continue to grow. But in our
view the Intertype form of reasoning has two definite advantages over 
the customary attitude, e.g., that which would prefer a company such as
Coca-Cola, at 22 times recent earnings and 35 times its asset value,
because of the virtually uninterrupted expansion of its profits for more
than 15 years.
The first advantage is that, after all, private business is conducted and
investments made therein on the same kind of assumptions that we have
made with respect to Intertype. The second is that reasoning of this kind
can be conservative in that it allows for a liberal margin of safety in case

of error or disappointment. It runs considerably less risk of confusion
between “confidence in the future” and mere speculative enthusiasm.
Large Profits Frequently Transitory. More frequently we have the
opposite type of situation from that just discussed. Here the analyst finds
reason to question the indefinite continuance of past prosperity.
Examples: Consider a company like J. W . Watson (“Stabilator”) Com-
pany, engaged chiefly in the manufacture of a single type of automotive
accessory. The success of such a “gadget” is normally short-lived; compe-
tition and changes in the art are an ever present threat to the stability of
earning power. Hence in such a case the student could have pointed out
that the market price, bearing the usual ratio to current and average earn-
ings, reflected a quite unwarranted confidence in the permanence of prof-
its that by their nature were likely to be transitory. Some of the pertinent
data relative to this judgment are given in the table below, with respect to
this company.

A similar consideration would apply to the exhibit of Coty, Inc., in
1928. Here was a company with an excellent earnings record, but the earn-
ings were derived from the popularity of a trade-marked line of cosmet-
ics. This was a field in which the variable tastes of femininity could readily
destroy profits as well as build them up. The inference that rapidly rising
profits in previous years meant much larger profits in the future was thus
especially fallacious in this case, because by the nature of the business a
peak of popularity was likely to be reached at some not distant point, after
which a substantial falling off would be, if not inevitable, at least highly
probable. Some of the data appearing on the Coty exhibit are as follows:

the reckless standards of appraisal beginning to prevail at the time.

**[Page 538]**

A third variety of this kind of reasoning could be applied to the brew-
ery-stock flotations in 1933. These issues showed substantial current or
prospective earnings based upon capacity operations and the indicated
profit per barrel. Without claiming the gift of second sight, an analyst could
confidently predict that the flood of capital being poured into this new
industry would ultimately result in overcapacity and keen competition.
Hence a continued large return on the actual cash investment was
scarcely probable; it was likely, moreover, that many of the individual
companies would prove financial failures, and most of the others would
be unable to earn enough to justify the optimistic price quotations engen-
dered by their initial success.

Chapter 38
SPECIFIC REASONS FOR QUESTIONING
OR REJECTING THE PAST RECORD
IN ANALYZING AN INDIVIDUAL company, each of the governing elements in
the operating results must be scrutinized for signs of possible unfavor-
able changes in the future. This procedure may be illustrated by various
examples drawn from the mining field. The four governing elements in
such situations would be: (1) life of the mine, (2) annual output, (3) pro-
duction costs and (4) selling price. The significance of the first factor has
already been discussed in connection with charges against earnings for
depletion. Both the output and the costs may be affected adversely if 
the ore to be mined in the future differs from that previously mined in
location, character or grade.

Rate of Output and Operating Costs.Examples: Calumet and Hecla
Consolidated Copper Company. The reports of this copper producer for
1936 and previous years illustrate various questions with respect to ore
reserves. The income account for 1936 may be summarized as follows:

1 When ore reserves are stated only as so many tons, or so many years of life, these data may
be misleading in the absence of assurance regarding the quality of ore remaining. Example:
The depletion charges of Alaska Juneau Gold Mining Company suggested a remaining life of
some 85 years from 1934. The registration statement however, claimed only some 25 years of
life from 1934. The implication (confirmed upon inquiry) is that the longer “life” included
much low-grade ore of noncommercial character.

Early in 1937 the stock sold at $20 per share, a valuation of
$40,000,000 for the company, or $30,000,000 for the mining properties
plus $10,000,000 for the working capital.
A detailed analysis of the make-up of the 1936 earnings would have
shown them to be derived from four separate sources, approximately 
as follows:
[488] SECURITY ANALYSIS
Profit before depreciation 
and depletion
Number of Cents per pound Total 
Source of copper pounds, millions (approximate) (approximate)
Copper previously produced 17.3 4.5 $   775,000

Reclamation plants 19.2 5.3 1,015,000
95.8 4.0 $3,855,000
Of these four sources of profit, all but the smallest were definitely lim-
ited in life. The sale of copper produced in prior years was obviously non-
recurring. The mainstay of the company’s production for 70 years—the
Conglomerate Branch—was facing exhaustion “in the course of 12 or 14
months. ” The reclamation-plant copper, recovered by reworking old tail-
ings and providing the cheapest metal, was limited to a life of 5 to 7 years.
There remained as the only more permanent source of future output the
Ahmeek Mine, which was the highest cost operation and which had
therefore been shut down from April 1932 through 1935. (There were
also certain other high-cost properties that were still shut down in 1936.)
Analysis would indicate, therefore, that probably not more than a
total of some 7 to 8 millions in profit could be expected in the future
from the Conglomerate and the reclamation operations. Hence, aside
from new developments of a speculative character, the greater part of the
40 millions of valuation for the company would have to be supported by
earnings from higher cost properties which had contributed only a minor
part of the 1936 results.

2 In the 1934 edition of this book we discussed a similar situation existing in this company
in 1927, at which time the largest part of the profits were being contributed by the reclama-
tion-plant operations, which were known to have a limited life.

Freeport Sulphur Company. The exhibit of the then Freeport Texas
Company in 1933 supplies the same type of problem for the analyst, and
it also raises the question of the propriety of the use, under such circum-
stances, of the past earnings record to support the sale of new securities.
An issue of $2,500,000 of 6% cumulative convertible preferred stock was
sold at $100 per share in January 1933 in order to raise funds to equip a
new sulphur property leased from certain other companies.
The offering circular stated among other things:
1. That the sulphur reserves had an estimated life of at least 25 years based
upon the average annual sales for 1928–1932;
2. That the earnings for the period 1928–1932 averaged $2,952,500, or 19.6
times the preferred-dividend requirement.
The implication of these statements would be that, assuming no
change in the price received for sulphur, the company could confidently
be expected to earn over the next 25 years approximately the amounts
earned in the past.
The facts in the case, however, did not warrant any such deduction. The
company’s past earnings were derived from the operation of two proper-
ties, at Bryanmound and at Hoskins Mound, respectively. The Bryan-
mound area was owned by the company and had contributed the bulk of
the profits. But by 1933 its life was “definitely limited” (in the words of the
listing application); in fact the reserves were not likely to last more than about
three years. The Hoskins Mound was leased from the Texas Company. After
paying $1.06 per ton fixed royalty, no less than 70% of the remaining prof-
its were payable to Texas Company as rental.
3 One half of Freeport’s sales
were required to be made from sulphur produced at Hoskins. The new
property at Grande Ecaille, La., now to be developed, would require roy-
alty payments amounting to some 40% of the net earnings.
When these facts are studied, it will be seen that the earnings of
Freeport Texas for 1928–1932 had no direct bearing on the results to be
expected from future operations. The sulphur reserves, stated to be good
for 25 years, represented mineral located in an entirely different place and
3 The rate had been 50% until Freeport recouped its capital expenditures on the property.
Illustrative of the general theme of this chapter is the break in Freeport’s price from 
1091/4 to 655/8 in January-February 1928 coincident with the change in the royalty rate. 
The student may examine a similar development in the case of Texas Gulf Sulphur, occur-
ring in 1934–1935.

to be extracted under entirely different conditions from those obtaining
in the past. A large profit-sharing royalty would be payable on the sulphur
produced from the new project, whereas the old Bryanmound was owned
outright by Freeport and hence its profits accrued 100% to the company.
In addition to this known element of higher cost, great stress must be
laid also upon the fact that the major future profits of Freeport were now
expected from a new project . The Grande Ecaille property was not yet
equipped and in operation, and hence it was subject to the many hazards
that attach to enterprises in the development stage. The cost of production
at the new mine might conceivably be much higher, or much lower, than
at Bryanmound. From the standpoint of security analysis the important
point is that, where two quite different properties are involved, you have
two virtually separate enterprises. Hence the 1928–1932 record of Freeport
Texas was hardly more relevant to its future history than were the figures
of some entirely different sulphur company, e.g., Texas Gulf Sulphur.
Returning once more to the business man’s viewpoint on security val-
ues, the Freeport Texas exhibit suggests the following interesting line of
reasoning. In June 1933 this enterprise was selling in the market for about
$32,000,000 (25,000 shares of preferred at 125 and 730,000 shares of com-
mon at 40). The major portion of its future profits were expected to be
derived from an investment of $3,000,000 to equip a new property leased
from three large oil companies. Presumably these oil companies drove as
good a bargain for themselves as possible in the terms of the lease. The
market was in effect placing a valuation of some $20,000,000, or more,
upon a new enterprise in which only $3,000,000 was to be invested. It was
possible, of course, that this enterprise would prove to be worth much
more than six times the money put into it. But from the standpoint of
ordinary business procedure the payment of such an enormous premium
for anticipated future results would appear imprudent in the extreme.
4
Evidently the stock market—like the heart, in the French proverb—has
reasons all its own. In the writers’ view, where these reasons depart 
[490] SECURITY ANALYSIS
4 Since the Freeport Texas preferred issue was relatively small, representing less than one-tenth
of the total market value of the company, this analysis would not call into question the safety of
the senior issue, but reflects only upon the soundness of the valuation accorded the common
stock—judged by investment standards. After 1933 the company did in fact encounter serious
problems of production, which held down the earnings and depressed the market price, but
these problems were later solved. Y et the maximum earnings attained by 1940—$3.30 per share
in 1937—could scarcely justify the price of 49 paid by speculators in 1933.

violently from sound sense and business experience, common-stock buy-
ers must inevitably lose money in the end, even though large speculative
gains may temporarily accrue, and even though certain fortunate purchases
may turn out to be permanently profitable.
The Future Price of the Product. The three preceding examples
related to the future continuance of the rate of output and the operating
costs upon which the past record of earnings was predicted. We must also
consider such indications as may be available in regard to the future sell-
ing price of the product. Here we must ordinarily enter into the field of
surmise or of prophecy. The analyst can truthfully say very little about
future prices, except that they fall outside the realm of sound prediction.
Now and then a more illuminating statement may be justified by the facts.
Adhering to the mining field for our examples, we may mention the enor-
mous profits made by zinc producers during the Great War, because of
the high price of spelter. Butte and Superior Mining Company earned no
less than $64 per share before depreciation and depletion in the two years
1915–1916, as the result of obtaining about 13 cents per pound for its out-
put of zinc, against a prewar average of about 5
1/4 cents. Obviously the
future earning power of this company was almost certain to shrink far
below the war-time figures, nor could these properly be taken together
with the results of any other years in order to arrive at the average or 
supposedly “normal” earnings.
5
Change in Status of Low-cost Producers. The copper-mining industry
offers an example of wider significance. An analysis of companies in this
field must take into account the fact that since 1914 a substantial number
of new low-cost producers have been developed and that other companies
have succeeded in reducing extraction costs through metallurgical
improvements. This means that there has been a definite lowering of the
“center of gravity” of production costs for the entire industry. Other things
being equal, this would make for a lower selling price in the future than
obtained in the past. (Such a development is more strikingly illustrated by
the crude-rubber industry.) Differently stated, mines that formerly rated
as low-cost producers, i.e., as having costs well below the average, may have
lost this advantage, unless they have also greatly improved their technique
5 The same type of reasoning clearly applies to the volume of business due to war conditions,
as well illustrated by the exhibits of airplane companies in 1939–1940.

of production. The analyst would have to allow for these developments in
his calculations, by taking a cautious view of future copper prices—at least
as compared with the prewar or the predepression average.

Anomalous Prices and Price Relationships in the History of the
I.R.T. System. The checkered history of the Interborough Rapid Tran-
sit System in New Y ork City has presented a great variety of divergences
between market prices and the real or relative values ascertainable by
analysis. Two of these discrepancies turn upon the fact that for specific
reasons the then current and past earnings should not have been accepted
as indicative of future earning power. In abbreviated form the details of
these two situations are as follows:
For a number of years prior to 1918 the Interborough Rapid Transit
Company was very prosperous. In the 12 months ended June 30, 1917, it
earned $26 per share on its capital stock and paid dividends of $20 per
share. Nearly all of this stock was owned by Interborough Consolidated
Corporation, a holding concern (previously called Interborough-Metro-
politan Corporation) which in turn had outstanding collateral trust
bonds, 6% preferred stock and common stock. Including its share of the
undistributed earnings of the operating company it earned about $11.50
per share on its preferred stock and about $2.50 on the common. The pre-
ferred sold in the market at 60, and the common at 10. These issues were
actively traded in, and they were highly recommended to the public by
various financial agencies which stressed the phenomenal growth of the
subway traffic.
A modicum of analysis would have shown that the real picture was
entirely different from what appeared on the surface. New rapid transit
facilities were being constructed under contract between the City of New
Y ork and the Interborough (as well as others under contract between the
City and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company). As soon as the new lines
were placed in operation, which was to be the following year, the earn-
ings available for Interborough were to be limited under this contract to
the figure prevailing in 1911–1913, which was far less than the current
[492] SECURITY ANALYSIS
6 On the other hand, the rise in the price of gold in 1933 invalidated for statistical purposes
previous earnings of gold producers based on $20.67 gold. Whether or not the future price
of gold will remain at $35 is anyone’s guess, but there seems no reason to make any calcula-
tions based on the old value.

profits. The City would then be entitled to receive a high return on its
enormous investment in the new lines. If and after all such payments were
made in full, including back accruals, the City and the Interborough
would then share equally in surplus profits. However, the preferential pay-
ments due the City would be so heavy that experts had testified that under
the most favorable conditions it would be more than 30 yearsbefore there
could be any surplus income to divide with the company.
The subjoined brief table shows the significance of these facts.

The underlying facts proved beyond question, therefore, that instead
of a brilliant future being in store for Interborough, it was destined to suf-
fer a severe loss of earning power within a year’s time. It would then be
quite impossible to maintain the $6 dividend on the holding company’s
preferred stock, and no earnings at all would be available for the com-
mon for a generation or more. On this showing it was mathematically
certain that both Interborough Consolidated stock issues were worth far
less than their current selling prices.

7 Indications pointed strongly to manipulative efforts by insiders in 1916–1917 to foist these
shares upon the public at high prices before the period of lower earnings began. The payment
of full dividends on the preferred stock, during an interlude of large earnings known to be
temporary, was inexcusable from the standpoint of corporate policy but understandable as a

**[Page 546]**

The sequel not only bore out this criticism, which it was bound to
do, but demonstrated also that where an upper limitof earnings or value
is fixed, there is usually danger that the actual figure will be less than the
maximum. The opening of the new subway lines coincided with a large
increase in operating costs, due to war-time inflation; and also, as was
to be expected, it diminished the profits of the older routes. Interbor-
ough Rapid Transit Company was promptly compelled to reduce its div-
idend, and it was omitted entirely in 1919. In consequence the holding
company, Interborough Consolidated, suspended its preferred dividends
in 1918. The next year it defaulted the interest on its bonds, became
bankrupt and disappeared from the scene, with the complete extinction
of both its preferred and common stock . Two years later Interborough
Rapid Transit Company, recently so prosperous, barely escaped an immi-
nent receivership by means of a “voluntary” reorganization which
extended a maturing note issue. When this extended issue matured in
1932, the company was again unable to pay, and this time receivers took
over the property.
During the ten-year period between the two receivership applications
another earnings situation developed, somewhat similar to that of 1917.
8
In 1928 the Interborough reported earnings of $3,000,000, or $8.50 per
share for its common stock, and the shares sold as high as 62. But these
earnings included $4,000,000 of “back preferential” from the subway divi-
sion. The latter represented a limited amount due the Interborough Rapid
Transit out of subway earnings to make good a deficiency in the profits
of the early years of operating the new lines. On June 30, 1928 the amount
of back preferential remaining to be paid the company was only

device to aid in unloading stock. These dividend distributions were not only unfair to the
41/2% bondholders, but, because of certain prior developments, they were probably illegal as
well. (Reference to this aspect of the case was made in Chap. 20 on accompanying CD).

$1,413,000. Hence all the profits available for Interborough stock were due
to a special source of revenue that could continue for only a few months
longer. Heedless speculators, however, were capitalizing as permanent an
earning power of Interborough stock which analysis would show was of
entirely nonrecurrent and temporary character.

Chapter 39
PRICE-EARNINGS RATIOS FOR COMMON
STOCKS. ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGES
IN CAPITALIZATION
IN PREVIOUS CHAPTERS various references have been made to W all Street’ s
ideas on the relation of earnings to values. A given common stock is gen-
erally considered to be worth a certain number of times its current earn-
ings. This number of times, or multiplier, depends partly on the prevailing
psychology and partly on the nature and record of the enterprise. Prior to
the 1927–1929 bull market ten times earnings was the accepted standard
of measurement. More accurately speaking, it was the common point of
departure for valuing common stocks, so that an issue would have to be
considered exceptionally desirable to justify a higher ratio, and conversely.
Beginning about 1927 the ten-times-earnings standard was super-
seded by a rather confusing set of new yardsticks. On the one hand, there
was a tendency to value common stocks in general more liberally than
before. This was summarized in a famous dictum of a financial leader
implying that good stocks were worth fifteen times their earnings.
1 There
was also the tendency to make more sweeping distinctions in the valua-
tions of different kinds of common stocks. Companies in especially
favored groups, e.g., public utilities and chain stores, in 1928–1929, sold
at a very high multiple of current earnings, say, twenty-five to forty times.
This was true also of the “blue chip” issues, which comprised leading units
in miscellaneous fields. As pointed out before, these generous valuations
[496]
1 The wording of this statement, as quoted in the Wall Street Journalof March 26, 1928, was
as follows: “ ‘General Motors shares, according to the Dow, Jones & Co. averages, ’ Mr.
Raskob remarked, ‘should sell at fifteen times earning power, or in the neighborhood of
$225 per share, whereas at the present level of $180 they sell at approximately only twelve
times current earnings. ’ ”

Analysis of the Income Account [497]
were based upon the assumed continuance of the upward trend shown
over a longer or shorter period in the past. Subsequent to 1932 there
developed a tendency for prices to rule higher in relation to earnings
because of the sharp drop in long-term interest rates.
Exact Appraisal Impossible. Security analysis cannot presume to lay
down general rules as to the “proper value” of any given common stock.
Practically speaking, there is no such thing. The bases of value are too
shifting to admit of any formulation that could claim to be even reason-
ably accurate. The whole idea of basing the value upon current earnings
seems inherently absurd, since we know that the current earnings are
constantly changing. And whether the multiplier should be ten or fifteen
or thirty would seem at bottom a matter of purely arbitrary choice.
But the stock market itself has no time for such scientific scruples. It
must make its values first and find its reasons afterwards. Its position is
much like that of a jury in a breach-of-promise suit; there is no sound
way of measuring the values involved, and yet they must be measured
somehow and a verdict rendered. Hence the prices of common stocks are
not carefully thought out computations but the resultants of a welter of
human reactions. The stock market is a voting machine rather than a
weighing machine. It responds to factual data not directly but only as they
affect the decisions of buyers and sellers.
Limited Functions of the Analyst in Field of Appraisal of Stock
Prices. Confronted by this mixture of changing facts and fluctuating
human fancies, the securities analyst is clearly incapable of passing judg-
ment on common-stock prices generally. There are, however, some con-
crete, if limited, functions that he may carry on in this field, of which the
following are representative:
1. He may set up a basis for conservativeor investmentvaluation of common
stocks, as distinguished from speculative valuations.
2. He may point out the significance of: (a) the capitalization structure; and (b)
the source of income, as bearing upon the valuation of a given stock issue.
3. He may find unusual elements in the balance sheet which affect the 
implications of the earnings picture.
A Suggested Basis of Maximum Appraisal for Investment.The
investor in common stocks, equally with the speculator, is dependent on

---
**[Page 550]**

future rather than past earnings. His fundamental basis of appraisal must
be an intelligent and conservative estimate of the future earning power. But
his measure of future earnings can be conservative only if it is limited by
actual performance over a period of time. We have suggested, however, that
the profits of the most recent year, taken singly, might be accepted as the
gage of future earnings, if(1) general business conditions in that year were
not exceptionally good, (2) the company has shown an upward trend of
earnings for some years past and (3) the investor’s study of the industry
gives him confidence in its continued growth. In a very exceptional case,
the investor may be justified in counting on higher earnings in the future
than at any time in the past. This might follow from developments involv-
ing a patent or the discovery of new ore in a mine or some similar specific
and significant occurrence. But in most instances he will derive the invest-
ment value of a common stock from the average earnings of a period
between five and ten years. This does not mean that all common stocks
with the same average earnings should have the same value. The common-
stock investor (i.e., the conservativebuyer) will properly accord a more lib-
eral valuation to those issues which have current earnings above the average
or which may reasonably be considered to possess better than average
prospects or an inherently stable earning power. But it is the essence of our
viewpoint that some moderate upper limit must in every casebe placed on
the multiplier in order to stay within the bounds of conservative valuation.
We would suggest that about 20 times average earningsis as high a price as
can be paid in an investmentpurchase of a common stock.
Although this rule is of necessity arbitrary in its nature, it is not
entirely so. Investment presupposes demonstrable value, and the typical
common stock’s value can be demonstrated only by means of an estab-
lished, i.e., an average, earning power. But it is difficult to see how aver-
age earnings of less than 5% upon the market price could ever be
considered as vindicating that price. Clearly such a price-earnings ratio
could not provide that margin of safetywhich we have associated with the
investor’s position. It might be accepted by a purchaser in the expecta-
tion that future earnings will be larger than in the past. But in the origi-
nal and most useful sense of the term such a basis of valuation is
speculative.
2 It falls outside the purview of common-stock investment.

Analysis of the Income Account [499]
Higher Prices May Prevail for Speculative Commitments.The intent of
this distinction must be clearly understood. We do not imply that it is a
mistake to pay more than 20 times average earnings for any common
stock. We do suggest that such a price would be speculative. The purchase
may easily turn out to be highly profitable, but in that case it will have
proved a wise or fortunate speculation. It is proper to remark, moreover,
that very few people are consistently wise or fortunate in their specula-
tive operations. Hence we may submit, as a corollary of no small practi-
cal importance, that people who habitually purchase common stocks at
more than about 20 times their average earnings are likely to lose consid-
erable money in the long run . This is the more probable because, in the
absence of such a mechanical check, they are prone to succumb recur-
rently to the lure of bull markets, which always find some specious argu-
ment to justify paying extravagant prices for common stocks.
Other Requisites for Common Stocks of Investment Grade and a Corol-
lary Therefrom. It should be pointed out that if 20 times average earn-
ings is taken as the upper limit of price for an investment purchase, then
ordinarily the price paid should be substantially less than this maximum.
This suggests that about 12 or 12
1/2 times average earnings may be suit-
able for the typical case of a company with neutral prospects. We must
emphasize also that a reasonable ratio of market price to average earn-
ings is not the only requisite for a common-stock investment. It is a nec-
essary but not a sufficient condition. The company must be satisfactory
also in its financial set-up and management, and not unsatisfactory in its
prospects.
From this principle there follows another important corollary, viz.: An
attractive common-stock investment is an attractive speculation . This is
true because, if a common stock can meet the demand of a conservative
investor that he get full value for his money plusnot unsatisfactory future
prospects, then such an issue must also have a fair chance of appreciat-
ing in market value.
Examples of Speculative and Investment Common Stocks.Our
definition of an investment basis for common-stock purchases is at vari-
ance with the Wall Street practice in respect to common stocks of high
rating. For such issues a price of considerably more than 20 times aver-
age earnings is held to be warranted, and furthermore these stocks are
designated as “investment issues” regardless of the price at which they

---
**[Page 552]**

sell. According to our view, the high prices paid for “the best common
stocks” make these purchases essentially speculative, because they require
future growth to justify them. Hence common-stock investment opera-
tions, as we define them, will occupy a middle ground in the market, lying
between low-price issues that are speculative because of doubtful quality
and well-entrenched issues that are speculative, none the less, because of
their high price.

December 1938 market price. It is also characteristic of such issues that they
sell for enormous premiums above the actual capital invested.
The companies analyzed in Group B are obviously speculative,
because of the great instability of their earnings records. They show vary-
ing relationships of market price to average earnings, maximum earnings,
and asset values.
The common stocks shown in Group C are examples of those which
meet specific and quantitative tests of investment quality. These tests
include the following:
1. The earnings have been reasonably stable, allowing for the tremendous
fluctuations in business conditions during the ten-year period.
2. The average earnings bear a satisfactory ratio to market price. 4
3. The financial set-up is sufficiently conservative, and the working-capital
position is strong.
Although we do not suggest that a common stock bought for invest-
ment be required to show asset values equal to the price paid, it is none
the less characteristic of issues in Group C that, as a whole, they will not
sell for a huge premium above the companies’ actual resources.
Common-stock investment, as we envisage it, will confine itself to
issues making exhibits of the kind illustrated by Group C. But the actual
purchase of any such issues must require also that the purchaser be 
satisfied in his own mind that the prospects of the enterprise are at least
reasonably favorable.
ALLOW ANCES FOR CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION
In dealing with the past record of earnings, when given on a per-share
basis, it is elementary that the figures must be adjusted to reflect any
important changes in the capitalization which have taken place during
the period. In the simplest case these will involve a change only in the
number of shares of common stock due to stock dividends, split-ups, etc.
All that is necessary then is to restate the capitalization throughout the
period on the basis of the current number of shares. (Such recalculations
are made by some of the statistical services but not by others.)
4 Note that the average earnings of the three companies in Group C were nearly two and
one-half times as large relative to market price as the maximum earnings of the companies
in Group A.

---
**[Page 556]**

When the change in capitalization has been due to the sale of addi-
tional stock at a comparatively low price (usually through the exercise of
subscription rights or warrants) or to the conversion of senior securities,
the adjustment is more difficult. In such cases the earnings available for
the common during the earlier period must be increased by whatever
gain would have followed from the issuance of the additional shares.
When bonds or preferred stocks have been converted into common, the
charges formerly paid thereon are to be added back to the earnings and
the new figure then applied to the larger number of shares. If stock has
been sold at a relatively low price, a proper adjustment would allow earn-
ings of, say, 5 to 8% on the proceeds of the sale. (Such recalculations need
not be made unless the changes indicated thereby are substantial.)
A corresponding adjustment of the per-share earnings must be made
at times to reflect the possible futureincrease in the number of shares out-
standing as a result of conversions or exercise of option warrants. When
other security holders have a choice of any kind, sound analysis must
allow for the possible adverse effect upon the per-share earnings of the
common stock that would follow from the exercise of the option.
Examples: This type of adjustment must be made in analyzing the
reported earnings of American Airlines, Inc., for the 12 months ended
September 30, 1939.

But there were outstanding $2,600,000 of 41/2% debentures, convert-
ible into common stock at $12.50 per share. The analyst must assumecon-
version of the bonds, giving the following adjusted result:

ALLOW ANCES FOR PARTICIPATING INTERESTS
In calculating the earnings available for the common, full recognition
must be given to the rights of holders of participating issues, whether or
not the amounts involved are actually being paid thereon. Similar
allowances must be made for the effect of management contracts provid-
ing for a substantial percentage of the profits as compensation, as in the
case of investment trusts. Unusual cases sometimes arise involving
“restricted shares, ” dividends on which are contingent upon earnings or
other considerations.
Example: Trico Products Corporation, a large manufacturer of auto-
mobile accessories, is capitalized at 675,000 shares of common stock, of
which 450,000 shares (owned by the president) were originally
“restricted” as to dividends. The unrestricted stock is first entitled to

further dividends. In addition, successive blocks of the restricted stock
were to be released from the restriction according as the earnings for 1925
and successive years reached certain stipulated figures. (To the end of
1938, a total of 239,951 shares had been thus released.)

Chapter 40
CAPITALIZATION STRUCTURE
THE DIVISION of a company’s total capitalization between senior securities
and common stock has an important bearing upon the significance of the
earning power per share. A set of hypothetical examples will help make
this point clear. For this purpose we shall postulate three industrial com-
panies, A, B and C, each with an earning power ( i.e., with average and
recent earnings) of $1,000,000. They are identical in all respects save cap-
italization structure. Company A is capitalized solely at 100,000 shares of
common stock. Company Bhas outstanding $6,000,000 of 4% bonds and
100,000 shares of common stock. Company C has outstanding $12,000,000
of 4% bonds and 100,000 shares of common stock.
We shall assume that the bonds are worth par and that the common
stocks are worth about 12 times their per-share earnings. Then the value
of the three companies will work out as follows:
[507]
Earnings for Value of Value of Total value
Company common stock common stock bonds of company
A $1,000,000 $12,000,000 $12,000,000
B 760,000 9,000,000 $6,000,000 15,000,000
C 520,000 6,000,000 12,000,000 18,000,000
These results challenge attention. Companies with identical earning
power appear to have widely differing values, due solely to the arrange-
ment of their capitalization. But the capitalization structure is itself a mat-
ter of voluntary determination by those in control. Does this mean that
the fair value of an enterprise can be arbitrarily increased or decreased
by changing around the relative proportions of senior securities and 
common stock?

Can the Value of an Enterprise Be Altered through Arbitrary
Variations in Capital Structure? To answer this question properly
we must scrutinize our examples with greater care. In working out the
value of the three companies we assumed that the bonds would be worth
par and that the stocks would be worth twelve times their earnings. Are
these assumptions tenable? Let us consider first the case of Company B.
If there are no unfavorable elements in the picture, the bonds might well
sell at about 100, since the interest is earned four times. Nor would the
presence of this funded debt ordinarily prevent the common stock from
selling at 12 times its established earning power.
It will be urged however, that, if Company B shares are worth 12 times
their earnings, Company A shares should be worth more than this mul-
tiple because they have no debt ahead of them. The risk is therefore
smaller, and they are less vulnerable to the effect of a shrinkage in earn-
ings than is the stock of Company B. This is obviously true, and yet it is
equally true that Company B shares will be more responsive to an increase
in earnings. The following figures bring this point out clearly:
[508] SECURITY ANALYSIS
Change in earnings
Earned per share per share from base 
Assumed earnings Co. A Co. B Co. A Co. B
$1,000,000 $10.00 $  7.60 (Base) (Base)
750,000 7.50 5.10 /H1100225% /H1100233%
1,250,000 12.50 10.10 /H1100125% /H1100133%
Would it not be fair to assume that the greater sensitivity of Company
B to a possible decline in profits is offset by its greater sensitivity to a pos-
sible increase? Furthermore, if the investor expects higher earnings in the
future—and presumably he selects his common stocks with this in
mind—would he not be justified in selecting the issue that will benefit
more from a given degree of improvement? We are thus led back to the
original conclusions that Company B may be worth $3,000,000, or 25%
more than Company A due solely to its distribution of capitalization
between bonds and stock.
Principle of Optimum Capitalization Structure.Paradoxical as this
conclusion may seem, it is supported by the actual behavior of common
stocks in the market. If we subject this contradiction to closer analysis, we

Analysis of the Income Account [509]
shall find that it arises from what may be called an oversimplificationof
Company A’s capital structure. Company A’s common stock evidently con-
tains the two elements represented by the bonds and stock of Company B.
Part of Company A’ s stock is at bottom equivalent to Company B’s bonds
and should in theory be valued on the same basis, i.e., 4%. The remainder
of Company A’s stock should then be valued at 12 times earnings. This the-
oretical reasoning would give us a combined value of $15,000,000, i.e., an
average 62/3% basis, for the two components of Company A stock, which,
of course, is the same as that of Company Bbonds and stock taken together.
But this $15,000,000 value for Company A stock would not ordinar-
ily be realized in practice. The obvious reason is that the common-stock
buyer will rarely recognize the existence of a “bond component” in a com-
mon-stock issue, and in any event, not wanting such a bond component,
he is unwilling to pay extra for it.
1 This fact leads us to an important prin-
ciple, both for the security buyer and for corporate management, viz.:
The optimum capitalization structure for any enterprise includes sen-
ior securities to the extent that they may safely be issued and bought for
investment.
Concretely this means that the capitalization arrangement of Company
B is preferable to that of Company A from the stockholder’s standpoint,
assuming that in both cases the $6,000,000 bond issue would constitute a
sound investment. (This might require, among other things, that the com-
panies show a net working capital of not less than $6,000,000 in accordance
with the stringent tests for sound industrial issues recommended in Chap.
13, which is on accompanying CD.) Under such conditions the contribu-
tion of the entire capital by the common stockholders may be called an over-
conservative set-up, as it tends generally to make the stockholder’s dollar
less productive to him than if a reasonable part of the capital were borrowed. 
An analogous situation holds true in most private businesses, where it is
1 See our discussion of American Laundry Machinery Company on pp. 505–507 of the 1934
edition of this work for an illustration of the possible effect of a change of capital structure
from an all-stock to a stock-and-bond combination. Actual changes of this kind were made
by American Zinc (through a dividend in preferred stock in 1916) and by Maytag Company
through similar distributions in 1928. The usual method of introducing a speculative capital-
ization structure into a company with a conservative set-up is through formation of a holding
company that issues its own senior securities and common stock against acquisition of the
operating company’s common. Examples:Chesapeake Corporation in 1927, Kaufmann
Department Stores Securities Corporation in 1925.

**[Page 562]**

recognized as profitable and proper policy to use a conservative amount
of banking accommodation for seasonal needs rather than to finance
operations entirely by owners’ capital.
Corporate Practices Resulting in Shortage of Sound Industrial
Bonds. Furthermore, just as it is desirable from the bank’s standpoint
that sound businesses borrow seasonally, it is also desirable from the
standpoint of investors generally that strong industrial corporations raise
an appropriate part of their capital through the sale of bonds. Such a pol-
icy would increase the number of high-grade bond issues on the market,
giving the bond investor a wider range of choice and making it deservedly
difficult to sell unsound bonds. Unfortunately the practice of industrial
corporations in recent years has tended to produce a shortage of good
industrial bond issues. Strong enterprises have in general refrained from
floating new bonds and in many cases have retired old ones. But this
avoidance of bonded debt by the strongest industrial companies has in
fact produced results demoralizing to investors and investment policies
in a number of ways. The following observations on this point, written
in 1934, are still applicable in good part:
1. It has tended to restrict new industrial-bond financing to companies of
weaker standing. The relative scarcity of good bonds impelled investment
houses to sell and investors to buy inferior issues, with inevitably disastrous
results.
2. The shortage of good bonds also tended to drive investors into the pre-
ferred-stock field. For reasons previously detailed (in Chap. XIV) straight
preferred stocks are unsound in theory, and they are therefore likely to prove
unsatisfactory investment media as a class.
3. The elimination (or virtual elimination) of senior securities in the set-up
of many large corporat ions has, of course, added somewhat to the invest-
ment quality of their common stocks, but it has added even more to the
investor’s demand for these common stocks. This in turn has resulted in a
good deal of common-stock buying by people whose circumstances required
that they purchase sound bonds. Furthermore it has supplied a superficial
justification for the creation of excessive prices for these common stocks; and
finally it contributed powerfully to that confusion between investment
motives and speculative motives which during 1927–1929 served to debauch
so large a proportion of the country’s erstwhile careful investors.

Analysis of the Income Account [511]
Appraisal of Earnings Where Capital Structure Is Top-heavy.In
order to carry this theory of capitalization structure a step further, let us
examine the case of Company C. We arrived at a valuation of $18,000,000
for this enterprise by assuming that its $12,000,000 bond issue would sell
at par and the stock would sell for 12 times its earnings of $5.20 per share.
But this assumption as to the price of the bonds is clearly fallacious. Earn-
ings of twice interest charges are not sufficient protection for an industrial
bond, and hence investors would be unwise to purchase such an issue at
par. In fact this very example supplies a useful demonstration of our con-
tention that a coverage of two times interest is inadequate. If it were
ample—as some investors seem to believe—the owners of any reasonably
prosperous business, earning 8% on the money invested, could get back
their entire capital by selling a 4% bond issue, and they would still have
control of the business together with one-half of its earnings. Such an
arrangement would be exceedingly attractive for the proprietors but 
idiotic from the standpoint of those who buy the bonds.
Our Company C example also sheds some light on the effect of the
rate of interest on the apparent safety of the senior security. If the
$12,000,000 bond issue had carried a 6% coupon, the interest charges of
$720,000 would then be earned less than 1
1/2 times. Let us assume that
Company D had such a bond issue. An unwary investor, looking at the
two exhibits, might reject Company D’s 6% bonds as unsafe because their
interest coverage was only 1.39 but yet accept the Company C bonds at
par because he was satisfied with earnings of twice fixed charges. Such
discrimination would be scarcely intelligent. Our investor would be
rejecting a bond merely because it pays him a generous coupon rate, and
he would be accepting another bond merely because it pays him a low
interest rate. The real point, however, is that the minimum margin of
safety behind bond issues must be set high enough to avoid the possibil-
ity that safety may even appear to be achieved by a mere lowering of the
interest rate. The same reasoning would apply of course to the dividend
rate on preferred stocks.
Since Company C bonds are not safe, because of the excessive size of
the issue, they are likely to sell at a considerable discount from par. We
cannot suggest the proper price level for such an issue, but we have indi-
cated in Chap. 26 that a bond speculative because of inadequate safety
should not ordinarily be purchased above 70. It is also quite possible that
the presence of this excessive bond issue might prevent the stock from

---
**[Page 564]**

selling at 12 times its earnings, because conservative stock buyers would
avoid Company C as subject to too great hazard of financial difficulties
in the event of untoward developments. The result may well be that,
instead of being worth $18,000,000 in the market as originally assumed,
the combined bond and stock issues of Company C will sell for less than
$15,000,000 (the Company Bvaluation), or even for less than $12,000,000
(the value of Company A).
As a matter of cold fact, it should be recognized that this unfavorable
result may not necessarily follow. If investors are sufficiently careless and
if speculators are sufficiently enthusiastic, the securities of Company C
may conceivably sell in the market for $18,000,000 or even more. But such
a situation would be unwarranted and unsound.
2 Our theory of capital-
ization structure could not admit a Company C arrangement as in any
sense standard or suitable. This indicates that there are definite limits
upon the advantages to be gained by the use of senior securities. We have
already expressed this fact in our principle of the optimum capitalization
structure, for senior securities cease to be an advantage at the point where
their amount becomes larger than can safely be issued or bought for
investment.
We have characterized the Company A type of capitalization arrange-
ment as “overconservative”; the Company C type may be termed “specu-
lative, ” whereas that of Company B may well be called “suitable” or
“appropriate.”
The Factor of Leverage in Speculative Capitalization Structure.
Although a speculative capitalization structure throws all the company’s
securities outside the pale of investment, it may give the common stock
a definite speculative advantage. A 25% increase in the earnings of Com-
pany C (from $1,000,000 to $1,250,000) will mean about a 50% increase
in the earnings per share of common (from $5.20 to $7.70). Because of
this fact there is some tendency for speculatively capitalized enterprises
[512] SECURITY ANALYSIS
2 In 1925 Dodge Brothers (motor) securities were sold to the public on the basis of
$160,000,000 principal value of bonds and preferred stock and about $50,000,000 market
value of common. Net tangible assets were only $80,000,000, and average earnings about
$16,000,000. This obviously top-heavy capitalization structure did not militate against the
security values at first, but a severe decline in earnings in 1927 soon revealed the unsound-

to sell at relatively high values in the aggregate during good times or good
markets. Conversely, of course, they may be subject to a greater degree of
undervaluation in depression. There is, however, a real advantage in the
fact that such issues, when selling on a deflated basis, can advance much
further than they can decline.

The record of American Water Works and Electric Company com-
mon stock between 1921 and 1929 presents an almost fabulous picture
of enhancement in value, a great part of which was due to the influence
of a highly speculative capitalization structure. Four annual exhibits dur-
ing this period are summarized in the table above.

stock, would have owned about 121/2 shares when the common sold at its
high price of 199 in 1929. His $6.50 would have grown to about $2,500.
While the market value of the common shares was thus increasing some
400-fold, the gross earnings had expanded to only 2.6 times the earlier
figure. The tremendously disproportionate rise in the common-stock
value was due to the following elements, in order of importance:
1. A much higher valuation placed upon the per-share earnings of this
issue. In 1921 the company’s capitalization was recognized as top-heavy;
its bonds sold at a low price, and the earnings per share of common were
not taken seriously, especially since no dividends were being paid on the
second preferred. In 1929 the general enthusiasm for public-utility shares
resulted in a price for the common issue of nearly 50 times its highest
recorded earnings.
2. The speculative capitalization structure allowed the common
stock to gain an enormous advantage from the expansion of the com-
pany’s properties and earnings. Nearly all the additional funds needed
were raised by the sale of senior securities. It will be observed that
whereas the gross revenues increased about 160% from 1921 to 1929,
the balance per share of old common stock grew 14-fold during the
same period.
3. The margin of profit improved during these years, as shown by the
higher ratio of net to gross. The speculative capital structure greatly
accentuated the benefit to the common stock from the additional net
profits so derived.

Other Examples: The behavior of speculatively capitalized enterprises
under varying business conditions is well illustrated by the appended
analysis of A. E. Staley Manufacturing Company, manufacturers of corn
products. For comparison there is given also a corresponding analysis of
American Maize Products Company, a conservatively capitalized enter-
prise in the same field.
The most striking aspect of the Staley exhibit is the extraordinary fluc-
tuation in the yearly earnings per share of common stock. The business
itself is evidently subject to wide variations in net profit, and the effect of

these variations on the common stock is immensely magnified by reason
of the small amount of common stock in comparison with the senior
securities.
4 The large depreciation allowance acts also as the equivalent
of a heavy fixed charge. Hence a decline in net before depreciation from
$3,266,000 in 1929 to $1,540,000 the next year, somewhat over 50%,
resulted in a drop in earnings per share of commonfrom $84 to only $3.74.
The net profits of American Maize Products were fully as variable, but
the small amount of prior charges made the fluctuations in common-
stock earnings far less spectacular.

of common, and in 1937 split the stock 10 for 1 and changed the par value from $100 to $10.

resulted in a low price for the bonds and the preferred stock, the latter being
affected particularly by the temporary suspension of its dividend in 1931.
The result was that, instead of showing an increased total value by reason of
the presence of senior securities, the company sold in the market at a much
lower relative price than the conservatively capitalized American Maize
Products. (The latter company showed a normal relationship between aver-
age earnings and market value. It should not properly be termed overcon-
servativelycapitalized because the variations in its annual earnings would
constitute a good reason for avoiding any substantial amount of senior secu-
rities. A bond or preferred stock issue of very small size, on the other hand,
would be of no particular advantage or disadvantage.)
The indication that the A. E. Staley Company was undervalued in 
January 1933 in comparison with American Maize Products is strength-
ened by reference to the relative current-asset positions and total
resources. Per dollar of net asset values the Staley company was selling
only one-third as high as American Maize.
The overdeflation of a speculative issue like Staley common in unfa-
vorable markets creates the possibility of an amazing price advance when
conditions improve, because the earnings per share then show so violent
an increase. Note that at the beginning of 1927 Staley common was
quoted at about 75, and a year later it sold close to 300. Similarly the
shares advanced from a low of 33 in 1932 to the equivalent of 320 in 1939.
A Corresponding Example. A more spectacular instance of tremen-
dous price changes for the same reason is supplied by Mohawk Rubber.
In 1927 the common sold at 15, representing a valuation of only $300,000
for the junior issue, which followed $1,960,000 of preferred. The com-
pany had lost $610,000 in 1926 on $6,400,000 of sales. In 1927 sales
dropped to $5,700,000, but there was a net profit of $630,000. This
amounted to over $23 per share on the small amount of common stock.
The price consequently advanced from its low of 15 in 1927 to a high of
251 in 1928. In 1930 the company again lost $669,000, and the next year
the price declined to the equivalent of only $4.
In a speculatively capitalized enterprise, the common stockholders
benefit—or have the possibility of benefiting—at the expense of the sen-
ior security holders. The common stockholder is operating with a little
of his own money and with a great deal of the senior security holder’s
money; as between him and them it is a case of “Heads I win, tails you

lose. ” This strategic position of the common stockholder with relatively
small commitment is an extreme form of what is called “trading on the
equity. ” Using another expression, he may be said to have a “cheap call”
on the future profits of the enterprise.
Speculative Attractiveness of “Shoe-string” Common Stocks
Considered. Our discussion of fixed-value investment has emphasized
as strongly as possible the disadvantage (amounting to unfairness) that
attaches to the senior security holder’s position where the junior capital
is proportionately slight. The question would logically arise if there are
not corresponding advantages to the common stock in such an arrange-
ment, from which it gains a very high degree of speculative attractive-
ness. This inquiry would obviously take us entirely outside the field of
common-stock investment but would represent an expedition into the
realm of intelligent or even scientific speculation.
We have already seen from our A. E. Staley example that in bad times
a speculative capitalization structure may react adversely on the market
price of both the senior securities and the common stock. During such a
period, then, the common stockholders do not derive a present benefit
at the expense of the bondholder. This fact clearly detracts from the spec-
ulative advantage inherent in such common stocks. It is easy to suggest
that these issues be purchased only when they are selling at abnormally
low levels due to temporarily unfavorable conditions. But this is really
begging the question, because it assumes that the intelligent speculator
can consistently detect and wait for these abnormal and temporary con-
ditions. If this were so, he could make a great deal of money regardless of
what type of common stock he buys, and under such conditions he might
be better advised to select high-grade common stocks at bargain prices
rather than these more speculative issues.
Practical Aspects of the Foregoing. To view the matter in a practical
light, the purchase of speculatively capitalized common stocks must be
considered under general or market conditions that are supposedly nor-
mal, i.e., under those which are not obviously inflated or deflated. Assum-
ing (1) diversification, and (2) reasonably good judgment in selecting
companies with satisfactory prospects, it would seem that the speculator
should be able to profit rather substantially in the long run from commit-
ments of this kind. In making such purchases, partiality should evidently
be shown to those companies in which most of the senior capital is in the
[518] SECURITY ANALYSIS

Analysis of the Income Account [519]
form of preferred stock rather than bonds. Such an arrangement removes
or minimizes the danger of extinction of the junior equity through default
in bad times and thus permits the shoe-string common stockholder to
maintain his position until prosperity returns. (But just because the pre-
ferred-stock contract benefits the common shareholder in this way, it is
clearly disadvantageous to the preferred stockholder himself.)
We must not forget, however, the peculiar practical difficulty in the
way of realizing the full amount of prospective gain in any one of the pur-
chases. As we pointed out in the analogous case of convertible bonds, as
soon as a substantial profit appears the holder is in a dilemma, because
he can hold for a further gain only by risking that already accrued. Just
as a convertible bond loses its distinctive advantages when the price rises
to a point that carries it clearly outside of the straight investment class,
so a shoe-string common-stock commitment is transformed into a more
and more substantial commitment as the price continues to rise. In our
Mohawk Rubber example the intelligent purchaser at 15 could not 
have expected to hold it beyond 100—even though its quotation did 
reach 250—because at 100, or before, the shares had lost the distinctive
characteristics of a speculatively capitalized junior issue.

Chapter 41
LOW-PRICED COMMON STOCKS.
ANALYSIS OF THE SOURCE OF INCOME
LOW-PRICED STOCKS
The characteristics discussed in the preceding chapter are generally
thought of by the public in connection with low-priced stocks. The major-
ity of issues of the speculatively capitalized type do sell within the low-
priced range. The definition of “low-priced” must, of course, be
somewhat arbitary. Prices below $10 per share belong to this category
beyond question; those above $20 are ordinarily excluded; so that the
dividing line would be set somewhere between $10 and $20.
Arithmetical Advantage of Low-priced Issues. Low-priced com-
mon stocks appear to possess an inherent arithmetical advantage arising
from the fact they can advance so much more than they can decline. It is
a commonplace of the securities market that an issue will rise more read-
ily from 10 to 40 than from 100 to 400. This fact is due in part to the pref-
erences of the speculative public, which generally is much more partial
to issues in the 10-to-40 range than to those selling above 100. But it is
also true that in many cases low-price common stocks give the owner the
advantage of an interest in, or “call” upon, a relatively large enterprise at
relatively small expense.
A statistical study of the relative price behavior of industrial stocks in
various price groups was presented in the April 1936 issue of The Journal
of Business of the University of Chicago .

period 1926–19352 and revealed a continuous superiority of diversified,

Analysis of the Income Account [521]
low-priced issues over diversified, high-priced issues as speculative
media. The following quotation from the study summarizes the results
and conclusions reached by the author:
Unless there are serious uncompensated errors in the statistical work here
presented, this investigation would seem to establish the existence of certain
relationships between price level and price fluctuations which have hitherto
gone unreported by students of stock-market phenomena. These relation-
ships may be briefly stated as follows:
1. Low-price stocks tend to fluctuate relatively more than high-price stocks.
2. In a “bull” market the low-price stocks tend to go up relatively more than
high-price stocks, and they do not lose these superior gains in the recessions
which follow. In other words, the downward movement of low-price stocks
is less than proportional to their upward movement, when compared with
the upward and downward movement of high-price stocks.
*********
Assuming (1) that the future behavior of the various price groups will be
similar to their past behavior and (2) that the selection of stocks on the basis
of the activity for the current year does not account completely, if at all, for
the superior performance of the stocks in the low-price groups, it seems 
logical to conclude the following:
1. Low-price industrial stocks offer greater opportunities for speculative prof-
its than high-price industrial stocks.
2. In case two or more issues of industrial stocks seem to offer equal prospec-
tive profits, the speculator should purchase the shares selling at the lowest price.
Some Reasons Why Most Buyers of Low-priced Issues Lose
Money. The pronounced liking of the public for “cheap stocks” would
therefore seem to have a sound basis in logic. Y et it is undoubtedly true
that most people who buy low-priced stocks lose money on their pur-
chases. Why is this so? The underlying reason is that the public buys
issues that are sold to it, and the sales effort is put forward to benefit the
seller and not the buyer. In consequence the bulk of the low-priced pur-
chases made by the public are of the wrong kind; i.e., they do not provide
bottoms of depressions in 1897, 1907, 1914 and 1921. Within its more limited scope this
study, published in 1931 by J. H. Holmes and Company, led to conclusions similar to those 
of Fritzemeier.

the real advantages of this security type. The reason may be either because
the companies are in bad financial condition or because the common
stock is low-priced in appearance only and actually represents a full or
excessive commitment in relation to the size of the enterprise. The latter
is preponderantly true of new security offerings in the low-priced range.
In such cases, a pseudo-low price is accomplished by the simple artifice
of creating so large a number of shares that even at a few dollars per share
the total value of the common issue is excessive. This has been true of
mining-stock flotations from of old and was encountered again in the
liquor-stock offerings of 1933 and in the airplane issues in 1938–1939.
A genuinely low-priced common stock will show an aggregate value
for the issue which is small in relation to the company’s assets, sales and
past or prospective profits. The examples shown herewith will illustrate
the difference between a “genuine” and “pseudo-low” price.

Observation of the stock market will show that the stocks of compa-
nies facing receivership are likely to be more active than those which are
very low in price merely because of poor current earnings. This phenom-
enon is caused by the desire of insiders to dispose of their holdings before
the receivership wipes them out, thus accounting for a large supply of
these shares at a low level and also sometimes for unscrupulous efforts to
persuade the unwary public to buy them. But where a low-priced stock
fulfills our conditions of speculative attractiveness, there is apt to be no
pressure to sell and no effort to create buying. Hence the issue is inactive
and attracts little public attention. This analysis may explain why the pub-
lic almost always buys the wrong low-priced issues and ignores the really
promising opportunities in this field.
Low Price Coupled with Speculative Capitalization.Speculatively
capitalized enterprises, according to our definition, are marked by a rela-
tively large amount of senior securities and a comparatively small issue of
common stock. Although in most cases the common stock will sell at a
low price per share, it need not necessarily do so if the number of shares
is small. In the Staley case, for example (referred to on pp. 515–516) even
at $50 per share for the common in 1933 the capitalization structure would
still have been speculative, since the bonds and preferred at par would rep-
resent over 90% of the total. It is also true that even where there are no
senior securities the common stock may have possibilities equivalent to
those in a speculatively capitalized enterprise. These possibilities will occur
wherever the market value of the common issue-represents a small
3 See Appendix Note 60, p. 800 on accompanying CD, for the sequel to these examples. For a
more recent contrast along the same lines the student is invited to compare the showing of
Continental Motors Corporation and Gilchrist Company when both were selling at $5 near
the close of 1939. Beyond our basic distinction, founded on the relationship between the val-
uation of the company and its assets and sales, there is here a striking contrast in the earn-
ings record and working-capital position.

Gimbel Brothers presents a typical picture of a speculatively capital-
ized enterprise. On the other hand Mandel Brothers has no senior secu-
rities ahead of the common, but despite this fact the relatively small
market value of the entire issue imparts to the shares the same sort of
speculative possibilities (though in somewhat lesser degree) as are found
in the Gimbel Brothers set-up. Note, however, that the rental payments

of Mandel Brothers are proportionately much higher than those of Gim-
bel Brothers and that these rental charges are equivalent in good part to
senior securities.
Large Volume and High Production Cost Equivalent to Specula-
tive Capital Structure.This example should lead us to widen our con-
ception of a speculatively situated common stock. The speculative or
marginalposition may arise from any cause that reduces the percentage of
gross available for the common to a subnormal figure and that therefore
serves to create a subnormal value for the common stock in relation to the
volume of business. Unusually high operating or production costs have the
identical effect as excessive senior charges in cutting down the percentage
of gross available for common. The following hypothetical examples of three
copper producers will make this point more intelligible and also lead to
some conclusions on the subject of large output versus low operating costs.

It is scarcely necessary to point out that the higher production cost of
Company C will have exactly the same effect as the bond-interest require-
ment of Company B (assuming output and production costs to continue
as stated).
General Principle Derived. The foregoing table is perhaps more use-
ful in showing concretely the inverse relationship that usually exists
between profit per unit and output per dollar of stock value.
The general principle may be stated that the lower the unit cost the
lower the production per dollar of market value of stock and vice versa.
Since Company A has a 7-cent cost, its stock naturally sells at a higher
price per pound of output than Company C with its 9-cent cost. Con-
versely, Company C produces more pounds per dollar of stock value than
Company A. This fact is not without significance from the standpoint of
speculative technique. When a rise in the price of the commodity occurs,
there will ordinarily be a larger advance, percentagewise, in the shares
of high-cost producers than in the shares of low-cost producers. The
foregoing table indicates that a rise in the price of copper from 10 to 13
cents would increase the value of Company A shares by 100% and the
value of Company B and C shares by 300%. Contrary to the general
impression in Wall Street, the stocks of high-cost producers are more
logical commitments than those of the low-cost producers when the
buyer is convinced that a rise in the price of the product is imminent and
he wishes to exploit this conviction to the utmost.
4 Exactly the same
advantage attaches to the purchase of speculatively capitalized common
stocks when a pronounced improvement in sales and profits is confi-
dently anticipated.
THE SOURCES OF INCOME
The “source of income” will ordinarily be thought of as meaning the same
thing as the “type of business. ” This consideration enters very largely into the
basis on which the public will value the earnings per share shown by a given
common stock. Different “multipliers” are used for different sorts of enter-
prise, but we must point out that these distinctions are themselves subject to
[526] SECURITY ANALYSIS
4 The action of the market in advancing Company B shares from 15 to 60 because copper rises
from 10 to 13 cents is in itself extremely illogical, for there is ordinarily no warrant for suppos-
ing that the higher metal price will be permanent. However, since the market does in fact
behave in this irrational fashion, the speculator must recognize this behavior in his calculation.

Analysis of the Income Account [527]
change with the changing times.5 Prior to the World War the railroad stocks
were valued most generously of all, because of their supposed stability . In
1927–1929 the public-utility group sold at the highest ratio to earnings,
because of their record of steady growth. Between 1933 and 1939 adverse
legislation and, in particular, the fear of government competition greatly
reduced the relative popularity of the utility stocks. The most liberal valua-
tions have recently been accorded to the large and well-entrenched indus-
trial enterprises which were able to maintain substantial earnings during the
depression and are considered to possess favorable long-term prospects.
Because of these repeated variations in relative behavior and popularity, secu-
rity analysis must hesitate to prescribe any definitive rules for valuing one
type of business as against another. It is a truism to say that the more impres-
sive the record and the more promising the prospects of stability and growth
the more liberally the per-share earnings should be valued, subject always to
our principle that a multiplier higher than about 20 (i.e., an “earnings basis”
of less than 5%) will carry the issue out of the investmentprice range.
A Special Phase: Three Examples.A more fruitful field for the tech-
nique of analysis is found in those cases where the source of income must
be studied in relation to specific assets owned by the company, instead of
in relation merely to the general nature of the business. This point may
be quite important when a substantial portion of the income accrues from
investment holdings or from some other fixed and dependable source.
Three examples will be used to illuminate this rather subtle aspect of
common-stock analysis.
1. Northern Pipe Line Company. For the years 1923–1925 the North-
ern Pipe Line Company reported earnings and dividends as follows:
5 See Cowles, Alfred, 3d, and associates (Common Stock Indexes, 1871–1937), pp. 43–46, 404–418,
Bloomington, Ind., 1938, for a study of earnings-price ratios for different industrial groups in suc-
cessive years from 1871 through 1937. Ratios for 1934–1938 and for 1936–1938 are supplied in
our analysis of the New Y ork Stock Exchange industrial list in Appendix Note 61, p. 800 on
accompanying CD.

1925 311,000 7.77 6
* Capitalization, 40,000 shares of common stock.

---
**[Page 580]**

In 1924 the shares sold as low as 72, in 1925 as low as 671/2 and in 1926
as low as 64. These prices were on the whole somewhat less then ten times
the reported earnings and reflected a lack of enthusiasm for the shares,
due to a pronounced decline in profits from the figures of preceding years
and also to the reductions in the dividend.
Analysis of the income account however, would have revealed the fol-
lowing division of the sources of income:
6
[528] SECURITY ANALYSIS
1923 1924 1925
Income Total Per share Total Per share Total Per share
Earned from:
Pipe-line operations $179,000 $4.48 $ 69,000 $1.71 $103,000 $2.57
Interest and rents 164,000 4.10 159,000 3.99 170,000 4.25
Nonrecurrent items dr. 35,000 dr. 0.88 dr. 14,000 0.35 cr. 38,000 cr. 0.95
$308,000 $7.70 $214,000 $5.35 $311,000 $7.77
This income account is exceptional in that the greater part of the prof-
its were derived from sources other than the pipe-line business itself.
About $4 per share were regularly received in interest on investments and
rentals. The balance sheet showed holdings of nearly $3,200,000 (or $80
per share) in Liberty Bonds and other gilt-edged marketable securities,
on which the interest income was about 4%.
This fact meant that a special basis of valuation must be applied to the
per-share earnings, inasmuch as the usual “ten-times-earnings” basis
would result in a nonsensical conclusion. Gilt-edged investments of $80
per share would yield an income of $3.20 per share, and at ten times earn-
ings this $80 would be “worth” only $32 per share, a reductio ad absur-
dum. Obviously, that part of the Northern Pipe Line income that was
derived from its bond holdings should logically be valued at a higher basis
than the portion derived from the fluctuating pipe-line business. A sound
valuation of Northern Pipe Line stock would therefore have to proceed
along the lines suggested below. The pipe-line earnings would have to be
valued at a low basis because of their unsatisfactory trend. The interest

plete financial and operating data were on file with the Interstate Commerce Commission

and rental income must presumably be valued on a basis corresponding
with the actual value of the assets producing the income. This analysis
indicated clearly that, at the price of 64 in 1926, Northern Pipe Line stock
was selling considerably below its intrinsic value.

7 A parallel situation existed in the case of Davis Coal and Coke Company prior to the distri-
bution of $50 per share to stockholders out of its large holdings of government bonds in
1937–1938. Shortly prior to this action the stock had sold at 35. The student can see from
the annual reports that the average earnings of $2.06 per share and average dividends of
$2.56 in 1934–1937 came entirely from sources other than the coal business.

* The nonrecurrent profits and losses are not taken into account.
2. Lackawanna Securities Company. This company was organized to
hold a large block of Glen Alden Coal Company 4% bonds formerly
owned by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company,
and its shares were distributed pro rata to the Delaware, Lackawanna and
Western stockholders. The Securities Company had outstanding 844,000
shares of common stock. On December 31, 1931 its sole asset—other than
about $1 per share in cash—consisted of $51,000,000 face value of Glen
Alden 4% first mortgage bonds. For the year 1931, the income account
was as follows:
Interest received on Glen Alden bonds . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$2,084,000

Superficially, the price of 23 in 1932 for a stock earning $2.15 did not
appear out of line. But these earnings were derived, not from ordinary
commercial or manufacturing operations, but from the holding of a bond

issue which presumably constituted a high-grade investment. (In 1931
the Glen Alden Coal Company earned $9,550,000 available for interest
charges of $2,151,000, thus covering the bond requirements 4
1/2 times.)
By valuing this interest income on about a 10% basis the market was in
fact valuing the Glen Alden bonds at only 37 cents on the dollar. (The
price of 23 for a share of Lackawanna Securities was equivalent to $60
face value of Glen Alden bonds at 37, plus $1 in cash)
Here again, as in the Northern Pipe Line example, analysis would
show convincingly that the customary ten-times-earnings basis resulted
in a glaring undervaluation of this specially situated issue.

3. Tobacco Products Corporation of Virginia.In this example, as in the
other two, the company was selling in the market for about ten times the
latest reported earnings. But the 1931 earnings of Tobacco Products were
derived entirely from a lease of certain of its assets to American Tobacco
Company, which provided for an annual rental of $2,500,000 for 99 years
from 1923. Since the American Tobacco Company was able to meet its
obligation without question, this annual rental income was equivalent to
interest on a high-grade investment. Its value was therefore much more
than ten times the income therefrom. This meant that the market valua-
tion of the Tobacco Products stock issues in December 1931 was far less
than was justified by the actual position of the company. (The value of
the lease was in fact calculated to be about $35,600,000 on an amortized
basis. The company also owned a large amount of United Cigar Stores’

Analysis of the Income Account [531]
stock, which later proved to be practically worthless, but these additional
holdings did not, of course, detract from the value of its American
Tobacco lease.)
Relative Importance of Situations of This Kind.The field of study
represented by the foregoing examples is not important quantitatively,
because, after all, only a very small percentage of the companies examined
will fall within this group. Situations of this kind arise with sufficient fre-
quency, however, to give this discussion practical value. It should be use-
ful also in illustrating again the wide technical difference between the
critical approach of security analysis and the highly superficial reactions
and valuations of the stock market.
Two Lines of Conduct Suggested. When it can be shown that cer-
tain conditions, such as those last discussed, tend to give rise to under-
valuations in the market, two different lines of conduct are thereby
suggested. We have first an opportunity for the securities analyst to detect
these undervaluations and eventually to profit from them. But there is
also the indication that the financial set-up that causes this undervalua-
tion is erroneous and that the stockholders’ interests require the correc-
tion of this error. The very fact that a company constituted like Northern
Pipe Line or Lackawanna Securities tends to sell in the market far below
its true value proves as strongly as possible that the whole arrangement
is wrong from the stand-point of the owners of the business.
At the bottom of these cases there is a basic principle of consistency
involved. It is inconsistent for most of the capital of a pipe-line enterprise
actually to be employed in the ownership of gilt-edged bonds. The whole
set-up of Lackawanna Securities was also inconsistent, because it replaced
a presumably high-grade bond issue, which investors might be willing to
buy at a fair price, by a nondescript stock issue which no one would pur-
chase except at an exceptionally low price. (In addition a heavy and need-
less burden of corporate income tax was involved, as was true in the
Tobacco Products case.)
Illogical arrangements of this kind should be recognized by the real
parties in interest, i.e., the stockholders, and they should insist that the
anomaly be rectified. This was finally done in the three examples just
given. In the case of Northern Pipe Line the capital not needed in the
pipe-line business was returned to the stockholders by means of special

---
**[Page 584]**

distributions aggregating $70 per share. The Lackawanna Securities Com-
pany was entirely dissolved and the Glen Alden bonds in its treasury dis-
tributed pro rata to the stockholders in lieu of their stock. Finally, the
Tobacco Products Corporation was recapitalized on a basis by which
6
1/2% bonds were issued against the American Tobacco lease, so that this
asset of fixed value was represented by a fixed-value security (which later
were redeemed at par) instead of by shares of stock in a corporation sub-
ject to highly speculative influences. By means of these corporate
rearrangements the real values were speedily established in the market
price.

The situations that we have just analyzed required a transfer of atten-
tion from the income account figures to certain related features revealed
in the balance sheet. Hence the foregoing topic—Sources of Income—
carries us over into our next field of inquiry: The Balance Sheet.
[532] SECURITY ANALYSIS
8 The student is invited to consider two further examples illustrating this point in 1939, viz.
1. Westmoreland Coal Company, selling at 8 although the company held some $18 per
share in cash assets alone. This case is broadly similar to our Davis Coal and Coke example,
although there were some differences. See discussion of this company on pp. 588–589.
2. American Cigarette and Cigar. In this case there is also a long-term lease to American
Tobacco Company (as in the Tobacco Products example), but the situation is complicated by
the company’s own operations, which have produced losses, and by ownership of other assets.
Attention is drawn also to our discussion of Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company on
p. 451, in which we suggested that the mining losses were perhaps inseparable from the
large income from lease of the railroad.

Introduction to Part VI
DECONSTRUCTING THE BALANCE SHEET
BY BRUCE GREENWALD
T
he enduring value of Security Analysis rests on certain critical ideas
developed by Graham and Dodd that were then, and remain, fun-
damental to any well-conceived investment strategy. The first of
these is the distinction between “investment” and “speculation” as
defined by Graham and Dodd:
An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises
safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting
these requirements are speculative. (p. 106)
The critical parts of this definition are “thorough analysis” and “safety
of principal and a satisfactory return. ” Nothing about these requirements
has changed since 1934.
A second related idea is that of focusing on the intrinsic value of a
security. It is, according to Graham and Dodd, 
that value which is justified by the facts, e.g., the assets, earnings, divi-
dends, [and] definite prospects, as distinct, let us say, from market quota-
tions established by market manipulation or distorted by psychological
excesses. (p. 64)
In an ideal world, intrinsic value would be the true value of a security;
in today’s language it would be the present discounted value of the
[535]

**[Page 588]**

expected future cash flows it generates.  If these expected cash flows and
an appropriate discount rate could be calculated perfectly from the avail-
able facts, then the intrinsic and true values would be the same. How-
ever, Graham and Dodd recognized that this was never possible.
“Inadequate or incorrect data and [the] uncertainties of the future”
meant that intrinsic value would always be “an elusive concept. ”
Nevertheless, thorough investigation of intrinsic value was, in this
view, central to any investment process worthy of the name. It served
first of all to organize examination and use of the available information,
ensuring that the relevant facts would be brought to bear and irrelevant
noise ignored. Second, it would produce an appreciation of the range of
uncertainty associated with any particular intrinsic value calculation.
Graham and Dodd recognized that even a very imperfect intrinsic value
would be useful in making investment decisions. In their words, 
It needs only to establish that the value is adequate—e.g., to protect a
bond or justify a stock purchase—or else that the value is considerably
higher or considerably lower than the market price . . . [and] the degree
of indistinctness may be expressed by a very hypothetical “range of
approximate value, ” which would grow wider as the uncertainty of the
picture increased. (pp. 66–67)
The purchase of securities should then be made only at prices far
enough below the intrinsic value to provide a margin of safety that
would offer appropriate protection against this “indistinctness” in the cal-
culated intrinsic value. In essence, what Graham and Dodd required was
that an investor, as opposed to a speculator, should know as far as possi-
ble the value of any security purchased and also the degree of uncer-
tainty attached to that value. An investment would be made only at a
price that provided a sufficient margin of safety to compensate for the
uncertainty involved. As a prescription for obtaining “protection of prin-
cipal and a satisfactory return, ” this approach has obvious advantages
over almost any conceivable alternative.
[536] Introduction to Part VI

**[Page 589]**

The compelling logic of these foundations is one source of the con-
tinuing relevance of Security Analysis. But the book also provides a
detailed roadmap of what a “thorough analysis” looks like that is exem-
plary in its completeness.
With regard to common stock investments, Graham and Dodd exam-
ine the roles of both present and future prospects (with an appropriately
skeptical view of the latter). They consider the implications of the quanti-
tative analyses of financial statemen ts and qualitative appreciations of
less easily quantifiable factors, like management. In the key area of quan-
titative analysis, they look comprehensively at all financial statements,
including most notably a firm’s balance sheet.
In this they were at odds with their contemporaries. In describing
those practices, Graham and Dodd noted,
We find little beyond the rather indefinite concept that “a good stock is a
good investment. ” “Good” stocks are those of either (1) leading compa-
nies with satisfactory records, . . . or (2) any well-financed enterprise
believed to have especially attractive prospects of increased future earn-
ings. . . . Balance-sheet values are considered to be entirely out of the
picture. Average [historical] earnings have little significance when there
is a marked trend. The so-called “price-earnings ratio” is applied variously,
sometimes to the past, sometimes to the present, and sometimes to the
near future. (p. 29)
This description might have been written today. So-called price-
earnings ratios continue to dominate valuation discussions. They are
applied even more “variously” than in the past; now they include the
ratio of a stock’s price to its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
and/or more perniciously the ratio of a stock’s price to its earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Balance
sheets are once again almost “entirely out of the picture. ” Today, as in
1934, a “thorough” analysis of intrinsic value encompassing all the rele-
vant information remains the exception rather than the rule.
Bruce Greenwald [537]

**[Page 590]**

With respect to the balance sheet, Graham and Dodd describe four
fundamental areas of usefulness. First, the balance sheet identifies the
quantity and nature of resources tied up in a business. For an economically
viable enterprise, these resources are the basis of its returns. In a competi-
tive environment, a firm without resources cannot generally expect to earn
any significant profits. If an enterprise is not economically viable, then the
balance sheet can be used to identify the resources that can be recovered
in liquidation and how much cash the resources might return.
Second, the resources on a balance sheet provide a basis for analyz-
ing the nature and stability of sources of income. As Graham and Dodd
note,
There are indeed certain presumptions in favor of purchases far below
asset value and against those made at a high premium above it. . . . A
business that sells at a premium does so because it earns a large return
upon its capital; this large return attracts competition, and, generally
speaking, it is not likely to continue indefinitely. Conversely, in the case
of a business selling at a large discount because of abnormally low earn-
ings. The absence of new competition, the withdrawal of old competition
from the field and other natural economic forces may tend eventually to
improve the situation and restore a normal rate of profit on the invest-
ment. (pp. 557–558)
Here, they recognize that earnings on assets that are well in excess of
a company’s cost of capital will be sustainable only under special circum-
stances. Thus, earnings estimates will be more realistic and accurate if
they are supported by appropriate asset values. Earnings without such
support are likely to be of short duration and, thus, of less value than
earnings protected by the necessary returns on assets in place.
Third, the liabilities side of the balance sheet, which identifies sources
of funding, describes the financial condition of the firm. A high level of
short-term debt (or long-term debt that expires in the near future) indi-
[538] Introduction to Part VI

**[Page 591]**

Bruce Greenwald [539]
cates a possibility of debilitating financial distress. Under these circum-
stances, even a slight impairment in profits may lead to significant per-
manent loss in the value of a business.
Fourth, the evolution of the balance sheet over time provides a check
on the quality of earnings. Today, this is covered, in principle, by the
statement of cash flows, which should reconcile revenue and cost flows
with changes in overall financial position. However, it remains true, as
Graham and Dodd noted, that
the form of the balance sheet is better standardized than the income
statement [or the statement of cash flows] and it does not offer such fre-
quent grounds for criticism. (p. 93)
A balance sheet is a snapshot of a company’s assets and liabilities at 
a particular time. It can be checked for accuracy and value at that
moment. This places significant constraints on the degree to which the
assets and liabilities can be manipulated. In contrast, flow variables such
as revenue and earnings measure changes over time that by their nature
are evanescent. If they are to  be monitored, they must be monitored
over an extended period. In 1934, and today, this fundamental difference
accounts for the superior reliability (in theory) of balance sheet figures.
Indeed, as we will discuss later, while the stock market was celebrating
WorldCom’s earnings growth in the late 1990s, signs of financial stress
were already showing up in the balance sheet, stresses that would even-
tually lead to one of the largest bankruptcies in history as measured by
the face value of the company’s debts.
Thorough Analysis
The special importance that Graham and Dodd placed on balance sheet
valuations remains one of their most important contributions to the idea
of what constitutes a “thorough” analysis of intrinsic value. It is also,

---
**[Page 592]**

[540] Introduction to Part VI
unfortunately, one of their most frequently overlooked contributions
outside the relatively small community of value investors.
The reason that the balance sheet is often ignored goes back to the
times that produced Security Analysis. Back then, the economy and busi-
nesses were operating under severely depressed conditions. As a result,
Graham and Dodd went to balance sheets to determine liquidation values
or, as a proxy for these, current assets minus all liabilities. The logic behind
this predisposition was compelling and conservative. If a company could be
bought at a price well below its liquidation value, then it seemed unam-
biguously to be a bargain. Earnings could pick up because of either an
improvement in a firm’s industry environment (competition eases or
demand recovers) or better management. If the earnings improvement pro-
duced a market value above liquidation value, all well and good. On the
other hand, if such positive earnings developments failed to materialize and
if this happened before the liquidation value of the firm was significantly
damaged, then the company could be liquidated and the proceeds distrib-
uted to its shareholders. In either case, the shareholders who bought below
liquidation value would earn a “satisfactory return” on their investment.
The only risk, of which Graham and Dodd were well aware, was that
management would continue to operate the firm unprofitably and, in
the process, dissipate the value of the assets. Thus, they advocated their
own version of shareholder activism as a necessary complement to this
kind of investing. As they wrote,
The choice of a common stock is a single act; its ownership is a continu-
ing process. Certainly there is just as much reason to exercise care and
judgment in being a stockholder as in becoming a stockholder. It is a
notorious fact, however, that the typical American stockholder is the
most docile and apathetic animal in captivity. (p. 575)
Taken as a whole, this approach was unimpeachable and, in its time,
successful in practice.

---
**[Page 593]**

Since then the practice of buying below liquidation value has been
undermined by two factors. First, the rapid rise in tax rates post-1940 has
meant that strategies like this one, which have often involved realizing
short-term gains over relatively short periods, have incurred high tax
costs. Second, and more importantly, opportunities to buy stocks at
prices below liquidation value, which were abundant in the 1930s, have
effectively disappeared in the long-term prosperity that has followed.
Relatively few industries in recent times have become economically non-
viable and hence candidates for liquidation. This reality has been embod-
ied in the general level of stock prices, with the result that Graham and
Dodd’s much beloved “net nets”—that is, companies selling below the
value of their current assets less all liabilities—are rare. And, when net
nets are available, their second requirement—namely, that management
not be dissipating those assets at a rapid rate—is seldom met.
However, the broader lessons that led Graham and Dodd to focus on
the balance sheets of firms continue to apply, with extensions that are
much within the spirit of their original approach. First, it is now recog-
nized that for economically viable firms, assets wear out or become
obsolete and have to be replaced. Thus, replacement value—the lowest
possible cost of reproducing a firm’s net assets by the competitors who
are best positioned to do it—continues to serve the role that Graham
and Dodd recognized. If projected profit levels for a firm imply a return
on assets well above the cost of capital, then competitors will be drawn
in. That, in turn, will drive down profits and with them the value of the
firm. Thus, earnings power unsupported by asset values—measured as
reproduction values—will, absent special circumstances, always be at risk
from erosion due to competition. Both “safety of principal” and the
promise of “a satisfactory return, ” therefore, require that “thorough”
investors support their earnings projections with a careful assessment of
the replacement values of a firm’s assets. Investors who do this will have
Bruce Greenwald [541]

**[Page 594]**

an advantage over those who do not, and they should outperform these
less thorough investors in the long run.
What appears to have deterred Graham and Dodd from considering
the replacement value of assets was the potential difficulty of calculating
them. They chose to focus on the wealth of new financial information
made available through the establishment of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. With today’s computers, that information can be
obtained and digested almost instantaneously. Moreover, industry
reports and trade publications, many of them available online, provide a
wealth of information on asset values that was inconceivable to Graham
and Dodd.
For example, the cost estimates of adding to existing reserves of oil
and gas are widely available, at least for U.S. companies. So are estimates
of recoverable deposits. As a result, investors today can calculate the val-
ues of resource companies’ holdings with a precision that was unattain-
able in the authors’ time. Physical property and equipment can also be
valued with a higher degree of accuracy. For real estate, assessors with
access to extensive transactions data can quickly and cheaply estimate
the cost of purchasing comparable properties.
For other plant and equipment, consulting engineers and industry
experts can provide this information. Using these sources, the cost of
adding aluminum fabricating capacity to existing plants could be esti-
mated at about $1,000 per ton per year. Existing capacity was available
to handle any foreseeable demand. The then current earnings of alu-
minum fabricators lead to market valuations which implied that their
existing capacity was worth well in excess of $1,000 per ton per year. The
result: a race to build new capacity to take advantage of the potential
earnings to be had in the fabricating business. This overexpansion
resulted in falling earnings and lower stock prices. Such companies
proved to be unsatisfactory investments. You could have anticipated this
development only through a thorough analysis of the balance sheet.

Another area of difficulty that Graham and Dodd recognized was the
valuation of intangible assets—product portfolios, customer relation-
ships, trained workers, brand recognition—many of which do not even
appear on a firm’s balance sheet. But today available information some-
times allows these balance sheet items to be usefully estimated. Some of
this information comes from financial sta tements. For example, the cost
of replicating product portfolios, assuming these are not protected by
patents, can be estimated using historical research and development
data both from a company itself or other companies in its industry.
This analysis can be supplemented by expert information. Investment
initiatives—whether new products, new store openings, or brand
launches—are almost always based on detailed business plans. These
plans identify the costs of such initiatives with reasonable accuracy and
the benefits more fancifully. Investors can use these data to estimate the
cost of producing intangible assets. Industry managers with substantial
experience will be able to estimate such costs.
More importantly, many intangible assets trade just like real property.
Cable franchises, clothing brands, new drug discoveries, store chains,
and even music labels are bought by sophisticated buyers (usually larger
companies) from sophisticated sellers (usually smaller companies). The
prices paid in these private market transactions are presumably made
with the alternative cost of internal development in mind. Thus, if a com-
pany like Liz Claiborne buys a brand that is similar to its own in-house
brands for 50 cents per dollar of sales, then presumably this is reason-
ably close—but lower than—the cost of reproducing its own brands.
These private market values are often used by sophisticated investors to
price intangible assets.
Once a thorough analysis of asset and earnings power value is com-
plete, there are three possible situations. The first is one in which the asset
value of a company exceeds the value of its foreseeable earnings. That tells
you the assets are not being used to full advantage by management. Here,

the critical factor for value investors is the prospect of some catalyst that
will alter either the behavior or identity of current management. Graham
and Dodd were aware of this although they were not cognizant of the
range of interventions available to activist investors today.
A second possibility is that earnings power may exceed the asset
value of a company. To maintain those superior profits, there needs to be
some economic factors to protect the firm from competition. Today,
these factors are referred to as “moats, ” franchises, barriers to entry, or
competitive advantages. What they look like and how they can be
assessed is an essential part of modern income statement analysis.
However, even in this case where asset values are least relevant, they do
provide useful information about the value a firm will retain if the factors
erode in the future.
The third case is one in which the earnings power and asset value of
a firm are approximately equal. This is the circumstance that should hold
with reasonable management and no special protections from competi-
tion. If qualitative judgments support such conclusions, then the asset
value provides a critical check on the validity of earnings projections. A
thorough asset valuation then helps to provide a complete picture of
what an investor is getting for a security and helps that investor settle
with confidence on an appropriate margin of safety.
Beyond these specific uses of asset valuations in current practice,
there is one final inescapable area in which asset values must be used.
Firms often have some assets—most notably cash—that are superfluous
to the operation of their basic businesses. Such assets do not usually
contribute to operating earnings, but they may represent an important
part of the intrinsic value of a purchased security. The value of these
assets must be added to any earnings-based value estimate (after appro-
priate subtraction of their interest income so as not to double count).
Performing a comprehensive asset valuation ensures that they are not
forgotten.

WorldCom: A Case Study
The financial statements of WorldCom, the telecom giant whose
bankruptcy filing in the summer of 2002 was at its time the largest ever,
illustrate the usefulness of a balance sheet analysis for tracking the
financial condition of companies. Indeed, anyone who had been studying
the balance sheet in the few years ahead of the bankruptcy would have
suspected the company would come to no good end. For instance, in the
middle of 1999, WorldCom had an equity market value of $125 billion.
This compared to a year-end 1999 book value of $51.2 billion, which had
been created almost entirely by issuing shares for acquisitions, notably
$12 billion for MFS Communications in 1996 and $30 billion for MCI in
1997. Retained earnings over the company’s 15-year history were negli-
gible, so over 85% of the book value was goodwill and other intangibles.
The ratio of market value to tangible net equity was in excess of 15. Such
ratios will vary by industry, but in this case, 15 is ridiculously high.
How valuable were those intangibles? Not worth as much as the
company said because they included neither significant patents nor
developed process technologies. Even more important, WorldCom’s busi-
ness was characterized by high rates of customer churn and vigorous
price competition for its telecommunications and data transmission ser-
vices. Nor did there appear to be large barriers to entry that might have
supported a market value significantly in excess of reproduction value,
or what it would cost to reproduce the network. WorldCom’s markets
were characterized by many new entrants (including those companies
acquired by WorldCom) and vigorous expansion by powerful existing
competitors like AT&T. If anything, to the extent that economies of scale
were relevant, WorldCom would have been operating at a significant
competitive disadvantage to its larger competitor, AT&T.
However, what is more remarkable than the improbable market value
placed on WorldCom’s assets is the detailed story told by the evolution

of its balance sheet. From year-end 1999 to year-end 2000, net property,
plant, and equipment increased by 27%, or about $8 billion. In contrast,
revenues increased by only 8%. That raised the question, why was such
an aggressive investment program underway at the company? In fact,
the investment figures turned out to have been fraudulently inflated by
booking operating expenses as investments. However, even if they had
not been fraudulent, the aggressive acc eleration in property, plant, and
equipment growth (up from about $5 billion in 1999) in the face of
decelerating revenue growth should have raised questions about the
management’s judgment. The likelihood of a bad outcome from this
insouciant attitude toward overexpansion should have been apparent.
Over the course of 2001, these consequences became clearly evident.
During 2001, WorldCom’s short-term debt almost entirely disappeared as
current debt liabilities fell from $7.2 billion to $172 million. In marked
contrast, long-term debt rose by about $12.5 billion. In fact, it actually
increased by about $14 billion since an examination of the balance sheet
footnotes indicated that more than $1 billion of additional long-term
debt had disappeared by the accounting expedient of deconsolidating
the subsidiary responsible for that debt. The fact that, in the face of now-
declining revenues, WorldCom felt that it needed an additional $7 billion
in debt financing—all of it long term—should have set off an alarm with
any investor who bothered to look at the balance sheet.
What happened? In 2000, WorldCom’s management lost control of its
finances, making at best a highly risky bet on future revenue growth and
at worst a calculated effort to disguise deteriorating operating margins
by capitalizing expenses. In 2001, WorldCom scrambled for long-term
financing, by which the company hoped to give management many
years to solve problems. There was really no choice since attempting to
sell equity in the face of a falling stock price would have sent a disastrous
signal to the market. The primary vehicle WorldCom used was an

$11.9 billion debt sale to the public in May 2001, underwritten by finan-
cial institutions that justified the issue in terms of future earnings and
cash flow. 
If these institutions and their customers had followed Graham’s advice
to look carefully at the WorldCom balance sheet, they would have known
better. They might not have fully anticipated the fraud and subsequent
bankruptcy of WorldCom, but they would have seen enough to avoid
both its stock and bonds as investments unlikely to provide either pro-
tection of principal or promise of a satisfactory return.

BALANCE-SHEET ANALYSIS.
SIGNIFICANCE OF BOOK VALUE
ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS prior to this point we have expressed our 
conviction that the balance sheet deserves more attention than Wall Street
has been willing to accord it for many years past. By way of introduction
to this section of our work, let us list five types of information and guid-
ance that the investor may derive from a study of the balance sheet:
1. It shows how much capital is invested in the business.
2. It reveals the ease or stringency of the company’s financial condition, i.e.,
the working-capital position.
3. It contains the details of the capitalization structure.
4. It provides an important check upon the validity of the reported earnings.
5. It supplies the basis for analyzing the sources of income.
In dealing with the first of these functions of the balance sheet, we
shall begin by presenting certain definitions. The book value of a stock is
the value of the assets applicable thereto as shown in the balance sheet. It
is customary to restrict this value to the tangible assets, i.e., to eliminate
from the calculation such items as good-will, trade names, patents, fran-
chises, leaseholds. The book value is also referred to as the “asset value, ”
and sometimes as the “tangible-asset value, ” to make clear that intangi-
bles are not included. In the case of common stocks, it is also frequently
termed the “equity. ”
Computation of Book V alue.The book value per shareof a common
stock is found by adding up all the tangible assets, subtracting all liabilities
and stock issues ahead of the common and then dividing by the number
of shares.

Balance-sheet Analysis. Implications of Asset Values [549]
In many cases the following formula will be found to furnish a short
cut to the answer:

By Surplus Items are meant not only items clearly marked as surplus but
also premiums on capital stock and such reserves as are really part of the
surplus. This would include, for example, reserves for preferred-stock
retirement, for plant improvement, and for contingencies (unless known
to be actually needed). Reserves of this character may be termed “Volun-
tary Reserves. ”

include the Deferred Charges with the other assets.

Treatment of Preferred Stock When Calculating Book Value of
Common. In calculating the assets available for the common stock, care
must be taken to subtract preferred stock at its proper valuation. Ordi-
narily, this will be the par or stated value of the preferred stock as it
appears in the balance sheet. But there is a growing number of cases in
which preferred stock is carried in the balance sheet at arbitrary values
far lower than the real liability attaching thereto.
Island Creek Coal Company has a preferred stock of $1 par, which is
entitled to annual dividends of $6 and to $120 per share in the event of
dissolution. In 1939 the price of this issue ruled about 120. In the calcula-
tion of the asset value of Island Creek Coal Common the preferred stock
should be deducted not at $1 per share but at $100 per share, its “true” or
“effective” par, or else at 120. Capital Administration Company, Ltd., an
investment trust, has outstanding preferred stock entitled to $3 cumula-
tive dividends and to $50 or $55 in liquidation, but its par value is $10. It
has also a Class A stock entitled to $20 in liquidation plus 70% of the assets
remaining and to 70% of the earnings paid out after preferred dividends,
but the par value of this issue is $1. Finally it has Class B stock, par 1 cent,
entitled to the residue of earnings and assets. Obviously a balance sheet
set up on the basis of par value is worse than meaningless in this case, and
it must be corrected by the analyst somewhat as follows:
BALANCE SHEET DECEMBER 31, 1938
As published As revised
Total assets (at cost) $5,335,300 (at mkt.) $5,862,500
Payables and accruals 1,661,200 1,661,200

Class A stock (at par $1) 143,400 (at 20*) 2,868,000

Surplus and reserves 3,094,300
Total liabilities $5,335,300 $5,862,600
* These approximate the effective par values of the issues.

**[Page 603]**

Coca-Cola Company has outstanding a no-par Class A stock entitled
to preferential dividends of $3 per share, cumulative, and redeemable at 55.
The company carries this issue as a liability at its “stated value” of $5 per
share. But the true par value is clearly $50.
1
In all instances such as the above an “effective par value” must be set up
for the preferred stock that will correspond properly to its dividend rate. 
A strong argument may be advanced in favor of valuing all preferred stocks
on a uniform dividend basis, say 5%, unless callable at a lower figure. 
This would mean that a $1,000,000 five per cent issue would be valued at
$1,000,000, a $1,000,000 four per cent issue would be given an effective
value of $800,000 and a $1,000,000 seven per cent noncallable issue would
be given an effective value of $1,400,000. But it is more convenient, of
course, to use the par value, and in most cases the result will be sufficiently
accurate.
2 A simpler method, which would work well for most practical
purposes, is to value preferred issues at par (plus back dividends) or mar-
ket, whichever is higher.
Calculation of Book Value of Preferred Stocks.In calculating the
book value of a preferred stock issue it is treated as a common stock and
the issues junior to it are left out of consideration. The following compu-
tations from the December 31, 1932, balance sheet of Tubize Chatillon
Corporation will illustrate the principles involved.
1 Amusingly enough, in 1929 the company carried as an asset 194,000 repurchased shares of
Class A stock at their cost of $9,434,000, although the entire issue of 1,000,000 shares
appeared as a liability of only $5,000,000. For a similar accounting absurdity applied to com-
mon stocks, see the June 1939 balance sheet of Hecker Products—on which its net stated lia-
bility for its capital stock works out as a minus figure.
2 Standard Statistics Company, Inc., follows the practice of deducting preferred stock at its
value in case of involuntary liquidation, when computing the book value of the common.
This is scarcely logical, because dissolution or liquidation is almost always a remote contin-
gency and would take place under conditions quite different from those obtaining at the
time of analysis. The Standard Statistics Company method results in placing a “value” of
$115 per share on Procter and Gamble Company $5 Second Preferred and a value of only
$100 per share on the same company’s $8 First Preferred. The real or practical value of the
preferred stockholder’s claims in this case would be much nearer in the proportion of 160
for the First Preferred against 100 for the Second Preferred, a 5% dividend yield basis for
both. In the case of investment-trust issues, liquidation values of preferred issues are more
relevant and should generally be used.

The Reserve for Depreciation and Miscellaneous Purposes was very
large and might have included arbitrary allowances belonging in Surplus.
But in the absence of details a reserve of this kind must be deducted from
the assets. (It later transpired that a substantial part of the reserve was
needed to absorb a write-off of plant abandoned owing to obsolescence.)
The book value of the Second Preferred stock is readily computed
from the foregoing, as follows:

---
**[Page 605]**

Net assets for First Preferred . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $9,676,000

Book value per share  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $52.75
In computing the book value of the common it would be an obvious
error to deduct the Second Preferred at its nonrepresentative par value of
$1. The “effective par” should be taken at not less than $100 per share, in
view of the $7 dividend. Hence there are no assets available for the com-
mon stock, and its book value is nil.
Current-asset Value and Cash-asset Value.In addition to the well-
known concept of book value, we wish to suggest two others of similar
character, viz., current-asset value and cash-asset value.
The current-asset value of a stock consists of the current assets alone,
minus all liabilities and claims ahead of the issue. It excludes not only the
intangible assets but the fixed and miscellaneous assets as well.
The cash-asset value of a stock consists of the cash assets alone, minus
all liabilities and claims ahead of the issue.
3 Cash assets, other than cash
itself, are defined as those directly equivalent to and held in place of cash.
They include certificates of deposit, call loans, marketable securities at
market value and cash-surrender value of insurance policies.
The following is an example of the computation of the three categories
of asset value:
Assets

3 Cash assets per share of common are sometimes calculated without deduction of any liabil-
ities. In our opinion this is a useful concept only when the other current assets exceed all 
liabilities ahead of the common.

increased by restoring the reserve of $425,000 subtracted therefrom in
the balance sheet. This is done because the deduction taken by the com-
pany is clearly a reserve for contingent decline in value that has not yet
taken place. As such it is entirely arbitrary or voluntary, and consistency
of method would require the analyst to regard it as a surplus item. The
same is true of the $210,000 “Reserve for Equipment and Other
Expenses, ” which, as far as can be seen, represents neither an actual lia-
bility nor a necessary deduction from the value of any specific asset.
In June 1929 Otis Company common stock was selling at 35. The
reader will observe an extraordinary divergence between this market
price and the current-asset value of the shares. Its significance will engage
our attention later.

Balance-sheet Analysis. Implications of Asset Values [555]
Practical Significance of Book Value.The book value of a common
stock was originally the most important element in its financial exhibit. It
was supposed to show “the value” of the shares in the same way as a mer-
chant’s balance sheet shows him the value of his business. This idea has
almost completely disappeared from the financial horizon. The value of a
company’s assets as carried in its balance sheet has lost practically all its
significance. This change arose from the fact, first, that the value of the
fixed assets, as stated, frequently bore no relationship to the actual cost
and, secondly, that in an even larger proportion of cases these values bore
no relationship to the figure at which they would be sold or the figure
which would be justified by the earnings. The practice of inflating the book
value of the fixed property is giving way to the opposite artifice of cutting
it down to nothing in order to avoid depreciation charges, but both have
the same consequence of depriving the book-value figures of any real sig-
nificance. It is a bit strange, like a quaint survival from the past, that the
leading statistical services still maintain the old procedure of calculating
the book value per share of common stock from many, perhaps most, bal-
ance sheets that they publish.
Before we discard completely this time-honored conception of book
value, let us ask if it may ever have practical significance for the analyst. In
the ordinary case, probably not. But what of the extraordinary or extreme
case? Let us consider the four exhibits shown on p. 556, as representative
of extreme relationships between book value and market price.
No thoughtful observer could fail to be impressed by the disparities
revealed in the examples given. In the case of General Electric and Com-
mercial Solvents the figures proclaim more than the bare fact that the mar-
ket was valuing the shares at many times their book value. The stock ticker
seems here to register an aggregate valuation for these enterprises that is
totally unrelated to their standing as ordinary business enterprises. In
other words, these are in no sense business valuations;they are products
of Wall Street’s legerdemain, or possibly of its clairvoyance.
Financial Reasoning vs. Business Reasoning. We have here the point
that brings home more strikingly perhaps than any other the widened rift
between financial thought and ordinary business thought. It is an almost
unbelievable fact that Wall Street never asks, “How much is the business
selling for?” Y et this should be the first question in considering a stock
purchase. If a business man were offered a 5% interest in some concern
for $10,000, his first mental process would be to multiply the asked price

by 20 and thus establish a proposed value of $200,000 for the entire
undertaking. The rest of his calculation would turn about the question
whether or not the business was a “good buy” at $200,000.

This elementary and indispensable approach has been practically aban-
doned by those who purchase stocks. Of the thousands who “invested” in
General Electric in 1929–1930 probably only an infinitesimal number had
any idea that they were paying on the basis of about 2
1/2 billions of dollars
for the company, of which over two billions represented a premium above
the money actually invested in the business. The price of 57 established for
Commercial Solvents in July 1933 was more of a gambling phenomenon,

induced by the expected repeal of prohibition. But the gamblers in this
instance were acting no differently from those who call themselves investors,
in their blithe disregard of the fact that they were paying 140 millions for 
an enterprise with about 10 millions of resources. (The fixed assets of 
Commercial Solvents, written down to nothing in the balance sheet, had
real value, of course, but not in excess of a few millions.)
The contrast in the other direction shown by our examples is almost
as impressive. A going but unsuccessful concern like Pennsylvania Coal
and Coke can be valued in the market at about one-sixteenth of its stated
resources almost on the same day as a speculatively attractive issue is bid
for at sixteen times its net worth. The Pepperell example is perhaps more
striking still, because of the unquestioned reality of the figures of book
value and also because of the high reputation, large earnings, and liberal
dividends of the enterprise covering a long stretch of years. Y et part own-
ers of this business—under the stress of depression, it is true—were will-
ing to sell out their interest at one-tenth of the value that a single private
owner would have unhesitatingly placed upon it.
Recommendation. These examples, extreme as they are, suggest rather
forcibly that the book value deserves at least a fleeting glance by the pub-
lic before it buys or sells shares in a business undertaking. In any partic-
ular case the message that the book value conveys may well prove to be
inconsequential and unworthy of attention. But this testimony should be
examined before it is rejected. Let the stock buyer, if he lays any claim to
intelligence, at least be able to tell himself, first, what value he is actually
setting on the business and, second, what he is actually getting for his
money in terms of tangible resources.
There are indeed certain presumptions in favor of purchases made far
below asset value and against those made at a high premium above it. (It
is assumed that in the ordinary case the book figures may be accepted as
roughly indicative of the actual cash invested in the enterprise.) A busi-
ness that sells at a premium does so because it earns a large return upon
its capital; this large return attracts competition, and, generally speaking,
it is not likely to continue indefinitely. Conversely in the case of a busi-
ness selling at a large discount because of abnormally low earnings. The
absence of new competition, the withdrawal of old competition from the
field, and other natural economic forces may tend eventually to improve
the situation and restore a normal rate of profit on the investment.

[558] SECURITY ANALYSIS
Although this is orthodox economic theory, and undoubtedly valid in
a broad sense, we doubt if it applies with sufficient certainty and celerity
to make it useful as a governing factor in common-stock selection. It may
be pointed out that under modern conditions the so-called “intangibles, ”
e.g., good-will or even a highly efficient organization, are every whit as real
from a dollars-and-cents standpoint as are buildings and machinery.
4
Earnings based on these intangibles may be even less vulnerable to com-
petition than those which require only a cash investment in productive
facilities. Furthermore, when conditions are favorable the enterprise with
the relatively small capital investment is likely to show a more rapid rate
of growth. Ordinarily it can expand its sales and profits at slight expense
and therefore more rapidly and profitably for its stockholders than a busi-
ness requiring a large plant investment per dollar of sales.
We do not think, therefore, that any rules may reasonably be laid down
on the subject of book value in relation to market price, except the strong
recommendation already made that the purchaser know what he is doing
on this score and be satisfied in his own mind that he is acting sensibly.
4 Judicial valuations of intangible assets (in the case of close corporations) still seem to
adhere to the old concept that they are less “real” than tangible assets and thus need larger
earnings, relatively, to support them. The divergence between the stock market’s bases of val-
uation and those of business men and the courts, as applied to private enterprises, would
provide excellent material for a critical study.
For a quantitative study leading to the conclusion that “good-will” has, on the whole,
proved more profitable than tangible assets, see Lawrence N. Bloomberg, The Investment
Value of Goodwill, Baltimore, 1938.

Chapter 43
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
CURRENT-ASSET VALUE
THE CURRENT -ASSET V ALUE of a common stock is more likely to be an
important figure than the book value, which includes the fixed assets.
Our discussion of this point will develop the following theses:
1. The current-asset value is generally a rough index of the liquidat-
ing value.
2. A large number of common stocks sell for less than their current-
asset value and therefore sell below the amount realizable in liquidation.
3. The phenomenon of many stocks selling persistently below their
liquidating value is fundamentally illogical. It means that a serious error
is being committed, either: (a) in the judgment of the stock market, ( b)
in the policies of the company’s management, or (c) in the attitude of the
stockholders toward their property.
Liquidating V alue.By the liquidating value of an enterprise we mean
the money that the owners could get out of it if they wanted to give it
up. They might sell all or part of it to some one else, on a going-concern
basis. Or else they might turn the various kinds of assets into cash, in
piecemeal fashion, taking whatever time is needed to obtain the best
realization from each. Such liquidations are of everyday occurrence in
the field of private business. By contrast, however, they are very rare
indeed in the field of publicly owned corporations. It is true that one
company often sells out to another, usually at a price well above liqui-
dating value, also that insolvency will at times result in the piecemeal
sale of the assets; but the voluntary withdrawal from an unprofitable
business, accompanied by the careful liquidation of the assets, is an infi-
nitely more frequent happening among private than among publicly
owned concerns. This divergence is not without its cause and meaning,
as we shall show later.

[560] SECURITY ANALYSIS
Realizable Value of Assets Varies with Their Character.A com-
pany’s balance sheet does not convey exact information as to its value in
liquidation, but it does supply clues or hints which may prove useful. The
first rule in calculating liquidating value is that the liabilities are real but
the value of the assets must be questioned. This means that all true 
liabilities shown on the books must be deducted at their face amount. The
value to be ascribed to the assets, however, will vary according to their
character. The following schedule indicates fairly well the relative depend-
ability of various types of assets in liquidation.
% of liquidating value to book value
Type of asset Normal range Rough average
Current assets:
Cash assets (including securities at market) 100 100
Receivables (less usual reserves)* 75–90 80
Inventories (at lower of cost or market) 50–75 662/3
Fixed and miscellaneous assets:
(Real estate, buildings, machinery, equipment, 
nonmarketable investments, intangibles, etc.) 1–50 15 (approx.)
* Note: Retail installment accounts must be valued for liquidation at a lower rate. Range about 30 to 60%. Average about 50%.
Calculation Illustrated. The calculation of approximate liquidating
value in a specific case is illustrated as follows:
Example: White Motor Company. (See next page.)
Object of This Calculation. In studying this computation it must be
borne in mind that our object is not to determine the exact liquidating value
of White Motor but merely to form a rough idea of this liquidating value in
order to ascertain whether or not the shares are selling for less than the stock-
holders could actually take out of the business. The latter question is answered
very definitely in the affirmative. With full allowance for possible error, there
was no doubt at all (in 1931) that White Motor would liquidate for a great
deal more than $8 per share, or $5,200,000 for the company. The striking
fact that the cash assets alone considerably exceed this figure, after deduct-
ing all liabilities, completely clinched the argument on this score.
Current-asset Value a Rough Measure of Liquidating Value.The esti-
mated values in liquidation as given for White Motor are somewhat lower

in respect of inventories and somewhat higher as regards the fixed and mis-
cellaneous assets than one might be inclined to adopt in other examples. We
are allowing for the fact that motor-truck inventories are likely to be less sal-
able than the average. On the other hand some of the assets listed as non-

[562] SECURITY ANALYSIS
would be likely to yield a larger proportion of their book values than the
ordinary property account. It will be seen that White Motor’s estimated 
liquidating value (about $31 per share) was not far from the current-asset
value ($34 per share). In the typical case it may be said that the noncurrent
assets are likely to realize enough to make up most of the shrinkage suffered
in the liquidation of the current assets. Hence our first thesis, viz., that the
current-asset value affords a rough measure of the liquidating value.
Prevalence of Stocks Selling below Liquidating Value. Our sec-
ond point is that for some years past a considerable number of common
stocks have been selling in the market well below their liquidating value.
Naturally the percentage was largest during the depression. But even in
the bull market of 1926–1929 instances of this kind were by no means
rare. It will be noted that the striking case of Otis Company, presented in
the last chapter, occurred during June 1929, at the very height of the
boom. The Northern Pipe Line example, given in Chap. 41, dates from
1926. On the other hand, our Pepperell and White Motor illustrations
were phenomena of the 1931–1933 collapse.
It seems to us that the most distinctive feature of the stock market of
those three years was the large proportion of issues which sold below their
liquidating value. Our computations indicate that over 40% of all the indus-
trial companies listed on the New Y ork Stock Exchange were quoted at
some time in 1932 at less than their net current assets. A considerable num-
ber actually sold for less than their cash-asset value, as in the case of White
Motor.
1 On reflection this m ust a ppear to be an extraordinary sta te of
affairs. The typical American corporation was apparently worth more dead
than alive. The owners of these great businesses could get more for their
interest by shutting up shop than by selling out on a going-concern basis.
In the recession of 1937–1938 this situation was repeated on a smaller
scale. Available data indicate that 20.5% of the industrial companies listed
on the New Y ork Stock Exchange sold in early 1938 at less than their 
net-current-asset value. (At the close of 1938, when the general price level
was by no means abnormally low, a total of 54 companies out of 648
industrials studied sold for less than their net current assets.

Balance-sheet Analysis. Implications of Asset Values [563]
It is important to observe that these widespread discrepancies between
price and current-asset value are a comparatively recent development. In
the severe market depression of 1921 the proportion of industrial stocks
in this class was quite small. Evidently the phenomena of 1932 (and 1938)
were the direct out-growth of the new-era doctrine which transferred all
the tests of value to the income account and completely ignored the bal-
ance-sheet picture. In consequence, a company without current earnings
was regarded as having very little real value, and it was likely to sell in the
market for the merest fraction of its realizable resources. Most of the sell-
ers were not aware that they were disposing of their interest at far less than
its scrap value. Many, however, who might have known the fact would have
justified the low price on the ground that the liquidating value was of no
practical importance, since the company had no intention of liquidating.
Logical Significance of This Phenomenon. This brings us to the
third point, viz., the logical significance of this “subliquidating-value”
phenomenon from the standpoint of the market, of the managements and
of the stockholders. The whole issue may be summarized in the form of
a basic principle, viz.:
When a common stock sells persistently below its liquidating value, then
either the price is too low or the company should be liquidated.
Two corollaries may be deduced from this principle:
Corollary I. Such a price should impel the stockholders to raise the
question whether or not it is in their interest to continue the business.
Corollary II. Such a price should impel the management to take all
proper steps to correct the obvious disparity between market quotation and
intrinsic value, including a reconsideration of its own policies and a frank
justification to the stockholders of its decision to continue the business.
The truth of the principle above stated should be self-evident. There
can be no soundeconomic reason for a stock’s selling continuously below
its liquidation value. If the company is not worth more as a going concern
than in liquidation, it should be liquidated. If it is worth more as a going
concern, then the stock should sell for more than its liquidating value.
Hence, on either premise, a price below liquidating value is unjustifiable.
Twofold Application of Foregoing Principle.Stated in the form of a log-
ical alternative, our principle invites a twofold application. Stocks selling
below liquidation value are in many cases too cheap and so offer an
attractive medium for purchase. We have thus a profitable field here for

**[Page 616]**

[564] SECURITY ANALYSIS
the technique of security analysis. But in many cases also the fact that an
issue sells below liquidating value is a signal that mistaken policies are
being followed and that therefore the management should take correc-
tive action—if not voluntarily, then under pressure from the stockhold-
ers. Let us consider these two lines of inquiry in order.
ATTRACTIVENESS OF SUCH ISSUES 
AS COMMITMENTS
Common stocks in this category practically always have an unsatisfac-
tory trend of earnings. If the profits had been increasing steadily, it is
obvious that the shares would not sell at so low a price. The objection to
buying these issues lies in the probability, or at least the possibility, that
earnings will decline or losses continue and that the resources will be dis-
sipated and the intrinsic value ultimately become less than the price paid.
It may not be denied that this does actually happen in individual cases.
On the other hand, there is a much wider range of potential developments
which may result in establishing a higher market price. These include the
following:
1. The creation of an earning power commensurate with the company’s
assets. This may result from:
a. General improvement in the industry.
b. Favorable change in the company’s operating policies, with or without a
change in management. These changes include more efficient methods,
new products, abandonment of unprofitable lines, etc.
2. A sale or merger, because some other concern is able to utilize the
resources to better advantage and hence can pay at least liquidating value
for the assets.
3. Complete or partial liquidation.
Examples of Effect of Favorable Developments on Such Issues.
General Improvement in the Industry. Examples already given, and cer-
tain others, will illustrate the operation of these various kinds of favor-
able developments. In the case of Pepperell the low price of 17 1/2
coincided with a large loss for the year ended June 30, 1932. In the fol-
lowing year conditions in the textile industry improved; Pepperell earned
over $9 per share and resumed dividends; consequently the price of the
stock advanced to 100 in January 1934 and to 149
3/4 in 1936.

**[Page 617]**

Balance-sheet Analysis. Implications of Asset Values [565]
Changes in Operating Policies. Hamilton W oolen Company, another
example in the textile field, is a case of individual rather than of general
improvement. For several years prior to 1928 the company had operated
at substantial losses, which amounted to nearly $20 and $12 per share in
1926 and 1927, respectively. Late in 1927 the common stock sold at $13
per share, although the company had net current assets of $38.50 per
share at that time. In 1928 and 1929 changes in management and in man-
agerial policies were made, new lines of product and direct sales meth-
ods were introduced, and certain phases of production were reorganized.
This resulted in greatly improved earnings which averaged about $5.50
per share during the succeeding four years, and within a single year the
stock had risen to a price of about $40.
3
Sale or Merger. The White Motor instance is typical of the genesis and
immediate effect of a sale or merger, as applied to an issue selling for less
than liquidating value. (The later developments, however, were quite
unusual.) The heavy losses of White Motor in 1930–1932 impelled the
management to seek a new alignment. Studebaker Corporation believed
it could combine its own operations with those of White to mutual advan-
tage, and it was greatly attracted by White’s large holdings of cash. Hence
in September 1932 Studebaker offered to purchase all White Motor’s
stock, paying for each share as follows:
$5 in cash.
$25 in 10-year 6% notes of Studebaker Corporation.
1 share of Studebaker common, selling for about $10.
It will be seen that these terms of purchase were based not on the
recent market price of White—below $7 per share—but primarily upon
the current-asset value. White Motor shares promptly advanced to 27 and
later sold at the equivalent of 31
1/2.4
An interesting example of the same kind, but of more recent date, is
afforded by Standard Oil Company of Nebraska. The facts may be out-
lined as follows:
3 For the later history of Hamilton Woolen Company, see pp. 584–585.
4 An extraordinary sequel of this transaction was the receivership of Studebaker Corporation in
April 1933, ostensibly caused by the opposition of minority stockholders of White Motor to a
merger of the two companies. But this development is quite unrelated to our point of discus-
sion, which turns upon the fact that in a sale or merger full recognition should always be, and is
ordinarily, given to liquidating value, even though the current market price may be much lower.

The company was engaged in the distribution of petroleum products
in Nebraska. It was carrying on an annual business of some $5,000,000
without appreciable profit. For the years 1935–1938 the reported earnings
before depreciation averaged $0.69 per share; after “expended deprecia-
tion” there was an average profit of $0.39 per share; and after depreciation
as taken by the company there was an average loss of $0.39 per share.
Here was a company clearly selling for much less than liquidating
value, the reason being its unsatisfactory earnings record. There was good
reason to believe, however, that the company was really worth more than
bare liquidating value, because the outlet it provided for gasoline, etc.,
would make its numerous retail and bulk stations a desirable acquisition
for some large refining company.
In April 1939 private interests offered to pay $12 per share for 66
2/3%
of the outstanding stock. This bid failed of acceptance by a sufficient
majority, but it was followed immediately by an offer to pay $17.50 per
share, made by Standard Oil Company of Indiana, the refiner that had
been supplying Standard Oil Company of Nebraska with its gasoline and
that evidently was loath to lose this important outlet. The deal was
promptly ratified; hence the stock of Standard Oil Company of Nebraska
nearly tripled in value during a four-month’s period in which the general
market had suffered a decline.

* After reducing securities and copper inventory to market value.
Shortly thereafter the management decided to liquidate the property.
Within the years 1932–1934 regular and liquidating dividends were paid,
aggregating $28.50 per share. It will be noted that the amount actually
received in liquidation proved identical with the current-asset value just
before the liquidation began, and it was 2
1/2 times the ruling market price
at that time.
Partial Liquidation. Northern Pipe Line Company and Otis Com-
pany, already discussed, are examples of the establishment of a higher
market value through partial liquidation. The two companies made the
exhibits as shown in the table following.
In September 1929 Otis Company paid a special dividend of $4 per
share, and in 1930 it made a distribution of $20 in partial liquidation,
reducing the par value from $100 to $80. In April 1931 the shares sold at
45 and in April 1932 at 41. These prices were higher than the quotation
in June 1929, despite the distributions of $24 per share made in the

interim, and despite the fact also that the general market level had
changed from fantastic inflation to equally fantastic deflation. Later the
company went out of business altogether and paid its stockholders an
additional $74 per share in liquidation—making the total received by
them $102 per share since June 1929 (inclusive of other dividends in
1929–1934 amounting to $4 per share).

Northern Pipe Line Company distributed $50 per share to its stockhold-
ers in 1928, as a return of capital, i.e., partial liquidation. This development
resulted in an approximate doubling of the market price between 1926 and
1928. Later a second distribution of $20 per share was made, so that the
stockholders received more in cash than in the low market price of 1925
and 1926, and they also retained their full interest in the pipe-line business.
Similar liberal distributions were made by most of the pipe-line companies
of the so-called Standard Oil group. (Note also the partial liquidation of
Davis Coal and Coke Company, described in the footnote on p. 529.)
Discrimination Required in Selecting Such Issues. There is
scarcely any doubt that common stocks selling well below liquidating
value represent on the whole a class of undervalued securities. They have
declined in price more severely than the actual conditions justify. This
must mean that on the wholethese stocks afford profitable opportunities
for purchase. Nevertheless, the securities analyst should exercise as much
discrimination as possible in the choice of issues falling within this cate-
gory. He will lean toward those for which he sees a fairly imminent
prospect of some one of the favorable developments listed above. Or else
he will be partial to such as reveal other attractive statistical features

besides their liquid-asset position, e.g., satisfactory current earnings and
dividends or a high average earning power in the past. The analyst will
avoid issues that have been losing their current assets at a rapid rate and
show no definite signs of ceasing to do so.
Examples: This latter point will be illustrated by the following com-
parison of two companies, the shares of which sold well below liquidat-
ing value early in 1933.
Hupp Motor 
Item Manhattan Shirt Company Car Corporation

Total assets for common 
(and preferred) $5,045,000 $7,328,000 $15,532,000 $35,212,000
Cash-asset value per share $ 7.50 Nil $2.625 $ 5.125
Current-asset value per share 16.00 $17.50 4.375 11.75
Both of these companies disclose an interesting relationship of cur-
rent assets to market price at the close of 1932. But a comparison with the
balance-sheet situation of three years previously will yield much more
satisfactory indications for Manhattan Shirt than for Hupp Motors. The
latter concern had lost more than half of its cash assets and more than
60% of its net current assets during the depression period. On the other
hand, the current-asset value of Manhattan Shirt common was reduced
by only 10% during these difficult times, and furthermore, its cash-asset
position was greatly improved. The latter result was obtained through the

[570] SECURITY ANALYSIS
liquidation of receivables and inventories, the proceeds of which paid off
the 1929 bank loans and largely increased the cash resources.
From the viewpoint of past indications, therefore, the two companies
must be placed in different categories. In the Hupp Motors case, we should
have to take into account the possibility that the remaining excess of cur-
rent assets over market price might soon be dissipated. This is not true so
far as Manhattan Shirt is concerned, and in fact the achievement of the
company in strengthening its cash position during the depression must be
given favorable consideration. We shall recur later to this phase of secu-
rity analysis, viz., the comparison of balance sheets over a period in order
to determine the true progress of an enterprise. The former point—that
attention should be paid also to the past earnings record—may be brought
home by a brief comparison of two companies in early 1939.
Item Ely & Walker Dry Goods Co. Pacific Mills
Price, January, 1939 17 14
Per share: Dec. 31, 1932 Dec. 31, 1938 Dec. 31, 1932 Dec. 31, 1938
Net current assets $30.00 $39.50 $26.95 $24.50
Net tangible assets 37.73 46.42 90.85 79.50
Average earnings, 1933–1938 1.82 2.41(d)
Average dividend, 1933–1938 1.25 0.50
The losses of Pacific Mills did not have a serious effect upon the bal-
ance-sheet position because they have come mainly out of the balance
sheet via the depreciation allowance. But unless there were special reasons
to expect a reversal of the operating results, the analyst would obviously
prefer Ely & Walker as an investment purchase.
Bargains of This Type. Common stocks that (1) are selling below
their liquid-asset value, (2) are apparently in no danger of dissipating
these assets, and (3) have formerly shown a large earning power on the
market price, may be said truthfully to constitute a class of investment
bargains. They are indubitably worth considerably more than they are
selling for, and there is a reasonably good chance that this greater worth
will sooner or later reflect itself in the market price. At their low price
these bargain stocks actually enjoy a high degree of safety, meaning by
safety a relatively small risk of loss of principal.

**[Page 623]**

Balance-sheet Analysis. Implications of Asset Values [571]
It may be pointed out, however, that investment in such bargain issues
needs to be carried on with some regard to general market conditions at the
time. Strangely enough, this is a type of operation that fares best, relatively
speaking, when price levels are neither extremely high nor extremely low.
The purchase of “cheap stocks” when the market as a whole seems much
higher than it should be, e.g., in 1929 or early 1937, will not work out well,
because the ensuing decline is likely to bear almost as severely on these neg-
lected or unappreciated issues as on the general list. On the other hand, when
all stocks are very cheap—as in 1932—there would seem to be fully as much
reason to buy undervalued leading issues as to pick out less popular stocks,
even though these may be selling at even lower prices by comparison.
A Common Stock Representing the Entire Business Cannot Be Less Safe
than a Bond Having a Claim to Only a Part Thereof.In considering these
issues it will be helpful to apply the converse of the proposition developed
earlier in this book with reference to senior securities. We pointed out
(Chap. 26) that a bond or preferred stock could not be worth more than
its value would be if it represented full ownership of the company, i.e., if
it were a common stock without senior claims ahead of it. The converse
is also true. A common stock cannot be less safethan it would be if it were
a bond, i.e., if instead of representing full ownership of the company it
were given a fixed and limited claim, with some new common stock cre-
ated to own what was left. This idea, which may appear somewhat
abstract at first, may be clarified by a concrete comparison between a
common stock and a bond issue of the types just described. Two compa-
nies in the investment-trust field are particularly well suited to illustrate
our point, because they were both organized by the same banking inter-
ests, and they have identical officers.
Our table (p. 572) should make clear that Shawmut Association stock
cannot be less safe intrinsically than the Investment Trust senior deben-
turesat 85. For, with the same management behind them, the stock invest-
ment has behind it 180% in assets, whereas the bonds are protected by
only 122% (of their market price) in assets. In addition to having this
greater protection the Association stock represents the entire ownership
of the company’s assets, whereas the interest of the Investment Trust
bonds is limited to their principal amount, the balance of the equity
belonging to the junior holders. (In fact this junior equity can be fairly
substantial, as measured by market price, even when the bonds are sell-
ing at a considerable discount.)

**[Page 624]**

[572] SECURITY ANALYSIS
That the Shawmut Associationstock is more attractive than the Invest-
ment Trust debentures at the prices quoted is scarcely open to challenge.
Undoubtedly, also, the investor who would consider the bond issue to be
“safer” than the Association shares is being misled by the form into over-
looking the essence. Y et something remains to be said of the effect of these
diverse forms upon the experience of the investor and consequently upon
his attitude. The Investment Trust bonds do carry a certain assurance of
continued income, because interest must be paid regularly or else the
company faces insolvency. It is true for the same reason that special efforts
will be made to pay them off at or before maturity in 1942 and 1952.
Therefore we find that the company has a special inducement to buy in
bonds at a discount—since they must ultimately be paid at par—and thus
one-third of the issue has been reacquired. This policy has served to
maintain the market price to an important extent and to improve the
position of the remaining bonds.
None of this is true with respect to the Shawmut Association shares.
They have in fact received continuous dividends since 1929, averaging 
65 cents, or 6
1/2% on the current price. But the rate has been variable, and

the average stockholder feels that he is at the mercy of the management’s
decisions. (This is not entirely so in fact, since the penalty clauses in the
Revenue Act virtually compel disbursement of the net income realized
by investment trusts.) Nor has the market price been maintained by com-
pany repurchases at a reasonable discount from break-up value, so that
the investor has been unable to look to the management to save him from
the hard necessity of sacrificing his shares at as much as 50% below their
intrinsic worth.
In the 1934 edition we illustrated this same point by considering
American Laundry Machinery stock at its price of 7 in January 1933,
which was equivalent to $4,300,000 for the entire company—as compared
with over $4,000,000 in cash, $21,000,000 in net current assets,
$27,000,000 in net tangible assets and 10-year average earnings of over
$3,000,000 (including, however, a loss of $1,000,000 in 1932). The last
two paragraphs of the chapter were as follows:
Wall Street would have considered American Laundry Machinery stock
“unsafe” at 7, but it would unquestionably have accepted a $4,500,000 bond
issue of the same company. Its “reasoning” would have run that the interest
on the bond was sure to be continued but that the 40-cent dividend then
being paid on the stock was very insecure. In one case the directors had no
choice but to pay interest and therefore would surely do so; in the other case
the directors could pay or not as they saw fit and therefore would very likely
suspend the dividend. But Wall Street is here confusing the temporary con-
tinuance of income with the more fundamental question of safety of princi-
pal. Dividends paid to common-stock holders do not in themselves make the
stock any safer. The directors are merely turning over to the stockholders
part of their own property; if the money were left in the treasury, it would
still be the stockholder’s property. There must therefore be an underlying fal-
lacy in assuming that if the stockholders were given the power to compel
payment of income— i.e., if they were made bondholders in whole or in
part—their position would thus be made intrinsically sounder. It is little short
of idiocy to assume that the stockholders would be better off if they surren-
dered their complete ownership of the company in exchange for a limited
claim against the same property at the rate of 5 or 6% on the investment. This
is exactly what the public would do if it were willing to buy a $4,500,000 bond
issue of American Laundry Machinery but would reject as “unsafe” the 
present common stock at $7 per share.

**[Page 626]**

Nevertheless, Wall Street persists in thinking in these irrational terms, and
it does so in part with practical justification. Somehow or other, common-
stock ownership does not seem to give the public the same powers and pos-
sibilities—the same values, in short—as are vested in the private owners of a
business. This brings us to the second line of reasoning on the subjects of
stocks selling below liquidating value.

Chapter 44
IMPLICATIONS OF LIQUIDATING VALUE.
STOCKHOLDER-MANAGEMENT
RELATIONSHIPS
WALL STREET HOLDS THAT liquidating value is of slight importance because
the typical company has no intention of liquidating. This view is logical, as
far as it goes. When applied to a stock selling below break-up value, the Wall
Street view may be amplified into the following: “ Although this stock would
liquidate for more than its market price, it is not worth buying because 
(1) the company cannot earn a satisfactory profit, and (2) it is not going to
liquidate. In the previous chapter we suggested that the first assumption is
likely to be wrong in a number of instances, for, although past earnings may
have been disappointing, there is always a chance that through external or
internal changes the concern may again earn a reasonable amount on its
capital. But in a considerable proportion of cases the pessimism of the mar-
ket will at least appearto be justified. We are led, therefore, to ask the ques-
tion: “Why is it that no matter how poor a corporation’s prospects may seem,
its owners permit it to remain in business until its resources are exhausted?”
The answer to this question takes us into the heart of one of the
strangest phenomena of American finance—the relations of stockhold-
ers to the businesses that they own. The subject transcends in its scope
the narrow field of security analysis, but we shall discuss it here briefly
because there is a distinct relationship between the value of securities 
and the intelligence and alertness of those who own them. The choice 
of a common stock is a single act; its ownership is a continuing process.
Certainly there is just as much reason to exercise care and judgment in
being as in becoming a stockholder.
Typical Stockholder Apathetic and Docile. It is a notorious fact,
however, that the typical American stockholder is the most docile and
apathetic animal in captivity. He does what the board of directors tell him

[576] SECURITY ANALYSIS
to do and rarely thinks of asserting his individual rights as owner of the
business and employer of its paid officers. The result is that the effective
control of many, perhaps most, large American corporations is exercised
not by those who together own a majority of the stock but by a small
group known as “the management. ” This situation has been effectively
described by Berle and Means in their significant work The Modern Cor-
poration and Private Property. In Chap. I of Book IV the authors say:
It is traditional that a corporation should be run for the benefit of its owners,
the stockholders, and that to them should go any profits which are distrib-
uted. We now know, however, that a controlling group may hold the power
to divert profits into their own pockets. There is no longer any certainty that
a corporation will in fact be run primarily in the interests of the stockhold-
ers. The extensive separation of ownership and control, and the strengthen-
ing of the powers of control, raise a new situation calling for a decision
whether social and legal pressure should be applied in an effort to insure cor-
porate operation primarily in the interests of the owners or whether such pres-
sure shall be applied in the interests of some other or wider group.
Again (on page 335) the authors restate this view in their concluding
chapter as follows:
… A third possibility exists, however. On the one hand, the owners of pas-
sive property, by surrendering control and responsibility over the active prop-
erty, have surrendered the right that the corporation should be operated in
their sole interest—they have released the community from the obligation to
protect them to the full extent implied in the doctrine of strict property
rights. At the same time, the controlling groups, by means of the extension
of corporate powers, have in their own interest broken the bars of tradition
which require that the corporation be operated solely for the benefit of the
owners of passive property. Eliminating the sole interest of the passive owner,
however, does not necessarily lay a basis for the alternative claim that the
new powers should be used in the interest of the controlling groups. The lat-
ter have not presented, in acts or words, any acceptable defense of the propo-
sition that these powers should be so used. No tradition supports that
proposition. The control groups have, rather, cleared the way for the claims
of a group far wider than either the owners or the control. They have placed
the community in a position to demand that the modern corporation serve
not alone the owners or the control but all society.

Balance-sheet Analysis. Implications of Asset Values [577]
Plausible but Partly Fallacious Assumptions by Stockholders.
Alert stockholders—if there are any such—are not likely to agree fully
with the conclusion of Messrs. Berle and Means that they definitely have
“surrendered the right that the corporation should be operated in their
sole interest. ” After all, the American stockholder has abdicated not
intentionally but by default. He can reassert the rights of control that
inhere in ownership. Quite probably he would do so if he were properly
informed and guided. In good part his docility and seeming apathy are
results of certain traditional but unsound viewpoints which he seems to
absorb by inheritance or by contagion. These cherished notions include
the following:
1. The management knows more about the business than the stock-
holders do, and therefore its judgment on all matters of policy is to be
accepted.
2. The management has no interest in or responsibility for the prices
at which the company’s securities sell.
3. If a stockholder disapproves of any major policy of the manage-
ment, his proper move is to sell his stock.
Assumed Wisdom and Efficiency of Management Not Always
Justified. These statements sound plausible, but they are in fact only
half truths—the more dangerous because they are not wholly false. It is
nearly always true that the management is in the best position to judge
which policies are most expedient. But it does not follow that it will
always either recognize or adopt the course most beneficial to the share-
holders. It may err grievously through incompetence. Stockholders of any
given company appear to take it for granted that their management is
capable. Y et the art of selecting stocks is said to turn largely on choosing
the well-managed enterprise and rejecting others. This must imply that
many companies are poorly directed. Should not this mean also that the
stockholders of any company should be open-minded on the question
whether its management is efficient or the reverse?
Interests of Stockholders and Officers Conflict at Certain
Points. But a second reason for not always accepting implicitly the deci-
sions of the management is that on certain pointsthe interests of the offi-
cers and the stockholders may be in conflict. This field includes the
following:

---
**[Page 630]**

[578] SECURITY ANALYSIS
1. Compensation to officers—Comprising salaries, bonuses, options
to buy stock.
2. Expansion of the business—Involving the right to larger salaries
and the acquisition of more power and prestige by the officers.
3. Payment of dividends—Should the money earned remain under the
control of the management or pass into the hands of the stockholders?
4. Continuance of the stockholders’ investment in the company—
Should the business continue as before, although unprofitable, or should
part of the capital be withdrawn, or should it be wound up completely?
5. Information to stockholders—Should those in control be able to
benefit through having information not given to stockholders generally?
On all of these questions the decisions of the management are inter-
ested decisions, and for that reason they require scrutiny by the stock-
holders. We do not imply that corporate managements are not to be
trusted. On the contrary, the officers of our large corporations constitute
a group of men above the average in probity as well as in ability. But this
does not mean that they should be given carte blanche in all matters
affecting their own interests. A private employer hires only men he can
trust, but he does not let these men fix their own salaries or decide how
much capital he should place or leave in the business.
Directors Not Always Free from Self-interest in Connection
with These Matters. In publicly owned corporations these matters are
passed on by the board of directors, whom the stockholders elect and to
whom the officials are responsible. Theoretically, the directors will rep-
resent the stockholders’ interests, when need be, as against the opposing
interests of the officers. But this cannot be counted upon in practice. In
many companies a majority, and in most companies a substantial part, of
the board is composed of paid officials. The directors who are not offi-
cers are frequently joined by many close ties to the chief executives. It
may be said in fact that the officers choose the directors more often than
the directors choose the officers. Hence the necessity remains for the
stockholders to exercise critical and independent judgments on all mat-
ters where the personal advantage of the officers may conceivably be
opposed to their own. In other words, in this field the usual presumption
of superior knowledge and judgment on the part of the management
should not obtain, and any criticism offered in good faith deserves care-
ful consideration by the stockholders.

Balance-sheet Analysis. Implications of Asset Values [579]
Abuse of Managerial Compensation. Numerous cases have come to
light in which the actions of the management in the matter of its own
compensation have been open to serious question. Most of these relate
to the years before 1933. In the case of Bethlehem Steel Corporation, cash
bonuses clearly excessive in amount were paid. In the case of American
Tobacco Company, rights to buy stock below the market price, of an enor-
mous aggregate value, were allotted to the officers. These privileges to
buy stock are readily subject to abuse. In the case of Electric Bond and
Share Company, the management permitted itself to buy many shares of
stock at far below market price. When later the price of the stock col-
lapsed to a figure less than the subscription price, the obligation to pay
for the shares was cancelled, and the sums already paid were returned to
the officers. A similar procedure was followed in the case of White Motor
Company, which will be more fully discussed later in this chapter.
Some of these transactions are explained, and partly justified, by the
extraordinary conditions of 1928–1932. Others are inexcusable from any
point of view. Nevertheless, human nature being what it is, such devel-
opments are not in the least surprising. They do not really reflect upon
the character of corporate managements but rather on the patent unwis-
dom of leaving such matters within the virtually uncontrolled discretion
of those who are to benefit by their own decisions.
The new regulations have done much to dispel the mist of secrecy that
formerly shrouded the emoluments and stockholdings of corporate offi-
cials. Information on salaries, bonuses and stock options must be filed in
connection with new security offerings, with the registration of issues on a
national exchange, with the subsequent annual reports to the Commission
and with the solicitation of proxies.
1 Although these data are not complete,
they are sufficient for the practical purpose of advising the stockholders as
to the cost of their management. Similarly, stockholdings of officers, direc-
tors and those owning 10% of a stock issue must be revealed monthly.
Since this information is not too readily accessible to the individual
stockholder, the statistical agencies could further improve their already
excellent service by subjoining the salary and stockholding data to their
annual lists of officers and directors.
1 Also, under provisions of the Revenue Act of 1936 the Treasury published the names and
compensation of all corporate officers receiving over $15,000 in that year. The Revenue Act
of 1938 requires these data for salaries of $75,000 or more, beginning with 1938.

[580] SECURITY ANALYSIS
In recent years the question of excessive compensation to manage-
ment has excited considerable attention, and the public understands
fairly well that here is a field where the officers’ views do not necessarily
represent the highest wisdom. It is not so clearly realized that to a con-
siderable extent the same limitations apply in matters affecting the use
of the stockholders’ capital and surplus. We have alluded to certain
aspects of this subject in our discussion of dividend policies (Chap. 29).
It should be evident also that the matter of raising new capital for expan-
sion is affected by the same reasoning as applies to the withholding of
dividends for this purpose.
Wisdom of Continuing the Business Should Be Considered.A
third question, viz., that of retaining the stockholder’s capital in the busi-
ness, involves considerations that are basically identical. Managements
are naturally loath to return any part of the capital to its owners, even
though this capital may be far more useful—and therefore valuable—out-
side of the business than in it. Returning a portion of the capital ( e.g.,
excess cash holdings) means curtailing the resources of the enterprise,
perhaps creating financial problems later on and certainly reducing some-
what the prestige of the officers. Complete liquidation means the loss of
the job itself. It is scarcely to be expected, therefore, that the paid officers
will consider the question of continuing or winding up the business from
the standpoint solely of what is in the best interests of the owners. We
must emphasize again that the directors are often so closely allied with
the officers—who are themselves members of the board—that they too
cannot be counted upon to consider such problems purely from the
stockholders’ point of view.
Thus it appears that the question whether or not a business should
be continued is one that at times may deserve independent thought by
its proprietors, the stockholders. (It should be pointed out also that this
is, by its formal or legal nature, an ownership problem and not a manage-
ment problem.) And a logical reason for devoting thought to this ques-
tion would arise precisely from the fact that the stock has long been
selling considerably below its liquidating value. After all, this situation
must mean that either the market is wrong in its valuation or the man-
agement is wrong in keeping the enterprise alive. It is altogether proper
that the stockholders should seek to determine which of these is wrong.
In this determination the views and explanations of the management

deserve the most appreciative attention, but the whole proceeding would
be stultified if the management’s opinion on this subject were to be
accepted as final per se.
It is an unhappy fact that in many cases where a management’s poli-
cies are attacked the critic has some personal axe to grind. This too is per-
haps inevitable. There is very little altruism in finance. Wars against
corporate managements take time, energy and money. It is hardly to be
expected that individuals will expend all these merely to see the right
thing done. In such matters the most impressive and creditable moves are
those made by a group of substantial stockholders, having an important
stake of their own to protect and impelled thereby to act in the interests
of the shareholders generally. Representations from such a source, in any
matter where the interest of the officers and the owners may conceivably be
opposed, should gain a more respectful hearing from the rank and file of
stockholders than has hitherto been accorded them in most cases.
2
Broadcast criticisms initiated by stockholders, proxy battles, and var-
ious kinds of legal proceedings are exceedingly vexatious to manage-
ments, and in many cases they are unwisely or improperly motivated. Y et
these should be regarded as one of the drawbacks of being a corporate
official and as part of the price of a vigilant stock ownership. The public
must learn to judge such controversies on their merits, as developed by
statements of fact and by reasoned argument. It must not allow itself to
be swayed by mere accusation or by irrelevant personalities.
The subject of liquidation must not be left without some reference to
the employees’ vital interest therein. It seems heartless in the extreme 
to discuss such a decision solely from the standpoint of what will be best
for the stockholder’s pocketbook. Y et nothing is to be gained by confus-
ing the issue. If the reason for continuing the business is primarily to keep
the workers employed, and if this means a real sacrifice by the owners,
they are entitled to know and to face the fact. They should not be told that
it would be unwise for them to liquidate, when in truth it would be prof-
itable but inhumane. It is fair to point out that under our present economic
system the owners of a business are not expected to dissipate their capital
for the sake of continuing employment. In privately owned enterprises

such philanthropy is rare. Whether or not a sacrifice of capital for this pur-
pose is conducive to the economic welfare of the country as a whole is a
moot point also, but it is not within our province to discuss it here. Our
object has been to clarify the issue and to stress the fact that a market price
below liquidating value has special significance to the stockholders and
should lead them to ask their management some searching questions.
Management May Properly Take Some Interest in Market Price
for Shares. Managements have succeeded very well in avoiding these
questions with the aid of the time-honored principle that market prices
are no concern or responsibility of theirs. It is true, of course, that a com-
pany’s officers are not responsible for fluctuations in the price of its secu-
rities. But this is very far from saying that market prices should never be
a matter of concern to the management. This idea is not only basically
wrong, but it has the added vice of being thoroughly hypocritical. It is
wrong because the marketability of securities is one of the chief qualities
considered in their purchase. But marketability must presuppose not only
a place where they can be sold but also an opportunity to sell them at a
fair price. It is at least as important to the stockholders that they be able
to obtain a fair price for their shares as it is that the dividends, earnings
and assets be conserved and increased. It follows that the responsibility
of managements to act in the interest of their shareholders includes the
obligation to prevent—in so far as they are able—the establishment of
either absurdly high or unduly low prices for their securities.
It is difficult not to lose patience with the sanctimonious attitude of
many corporate executives who profess not even to know the market
price of their securities. In many cases they have a vital personal interest
in these very market prices, and at times they use their inside knowledge
to take advantage in the market of the outside public and of their own
stockholders.
3 Not as a startling innovation but as a common-sense
3 This reached such scandalous proportions “in the good old days” that the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 made “insiders” accountable to the corporation for profits realized on
purchases and sales, or vice versa, completed within a six months’ period. Enforcement must
be through a stockholder’s suit. This provision has been bitterly criticized in Wall Street as pre-
venting legitimate activities of officers and directors, including support of the market price at
critical times. Our own view is that, on balance, both logic and practicality are against the pro-
vision as it now stands. Publicity of operations—perhaps immediate rather than monthly—
should supply a sufficient safeguard against fraud and a check upon questionable conduct.

recognition of things as they are, we recommend that directors be held
to the duty of observing the market price of their securities and of using
all proper efforts to correct patent discrepancies, in the same way as they
would endeavor to remedy any other corporate condition inimical to the
stockholders’ interest.
Various Possible Moves for Correcting Market Prices for
Shares. The forms that these proper efforts might take are various. In
the first place the stockholders’ attention may be called officially to the
fact that the liquidating, and therefore the minimum, value of the shares
is substantially higher than the market price. If, as will usually be the case,
the directors are convinced that continuance is preferable to liquidation,
the reasons leading to this conclusion should at the same time be sup-
plied. A second line of action is in the direction of dividends. A special
endeavor should be made to establish a dividend rate proportionate at
least to the liquidating value, in order that the stockholders should not
suffer a loss of income through keeping the business alive. This may be
done even if current earnings are insufficient, provided there are accu-
mulated profits and provided also the cash position is strong enough to
permit such payments.
A third procedure consists of returning to the stockholders such
cash capital as is not needed for the conduct of the business. This may
be done through a pro rata distribution, accompanied usually by a
reduction in par value or through an offer to purchase a certain num-
ber of shares pro rata at a fair price. Finally, a careful consideration by
the directors of the discrepancy between earning power and liquidat-
ing value may lead them to conclude that a sale or winding up of the
enterprise is the most sensible corrective step—in which case they
should act accordingly.
Examples: Otis Company, 1929–1939. The course of action followed
by the Otis Company management in 1929–1930 combined a number of
these remedial moves. In July 1929 the president circularized the share-
holders, presenting an intermediate balance sheet as of June 30 and
emphasizing the disparity between the current bid price and the liquidat-
ing value. In September of that year—although earnings were no larger
than before—dividend payments were resumed, a step permitted by the
company’s large cash holdings and substantial surplus. In 1930 a good
part of the cash, apparently not needed in the business, was returned to

[584] SECURITY ANALYSIS
the stockholders through the redemption of the small preferred issue and
the repayment of $20 per share of common stock on account of capital.4
Subsequently the company embarked on a policy of piecemeal liquida-
tion which resulted in a series of payments on capital account. From 
September 1929 to the final distribution in 1940 there was paid a total of
$94 per share as return of capital, as well as $8 in the form of dividends. As
we pointed out in our last chapter, these steps were highly effective in
improving the status of the Otis stockholders during a period when most
other issues were suffering a shrinkage in value, and ultimately gave them
a far larger return than they were likely to receive through the continuance
of the business.
Hamilton Woolen Company.The history of this enterprise since 1926
is even more interesting in this connection because it suggests a model
technique for the handling by directors of problems affecting the stock-
holders’ investment. In 1927 continued operating losses had resulted in
a market price well below liquidating value. There was danger that the
losses might continue and wipe out the capital. On the other hand, there
was a possibility of much better results in the future, especially if new
policies were adopted. A statement of the arguments for and against liq-
uidation was forwarded to the stockholders, and they were asked to vote
on the question. They voted to continue the business, with a new oper-
ating head; and the decision proved a wise one, since good earnings were
realized, and the price advanced above liquidating value.
In 1934, however, the company again showed a large loss, occasioned
in good part by serious labor difficulties. The management again submit-
ted the question of liquidation to the stockholders, and this time a wind-
ing up of the business was voted. A sale of the business was promptly
arranged, and the stockholders received somewhat more than the Novem-
ber 1934 current-asset value.
Particularly noteworthy were the details of the 1927 proceedings. The
ultimate decision—to continue or to quit—was put up to the stockhold-
ers in whose province it lay; the management supplied information,

(1927–1937), Keystone Watch Case Corporation (1932–1933) as well as Davis Coal and
Coke Company and the several Standard Oil pipe line companies previously referred to

expressed its own opinion and permitted an adequate statement of the
other side of the case.
Other Examples of Voluntary Liquidation. The subjoined partial list
will demonstrate an obvious but fundamental fact, viz., that the liquida-
tion (or sale) of an unprofitable company holding substantial assets 
(particularly current) is almost certain to realize for the stockholders con-
siderably more than the previously existing market price. The reason is,
of course, that the market price is governed chiefly by the earnings,
whereas the proceeds of liquidation depend upon the assets.

Repurchase of Shares Pro Rata from Shareholders. The Hamilton
Woolen management is also to be commended for its action during 1932
and 1933 in employing excess cash capital to repurchase pro rata a sub-
stantial number of shares at a reasonable price. This reversed the proce-
dure followed in 1929 when additional shares were offered for
subscription to the stockholders. The contraction in business that accom-
panied the depression made this additional capital no longer necessary,
and it was therefore a logical move to give most of it back to the stock-
holders, to whom it was of greater benefit when in their own pockets than
in the treasury of the corporation.

5 Hamilton Woolen sold 13,000 shares pro rata to stockholders at $50 per share in 1929. It
repurchased, pro rata, 6,500 shares at $65 in 1932 and 1,200 shares at $50 in 1933. Faultless
Rubber Company followed a similar procedure in 1934. Simms Petroleum Company reac-
quired stock both directly from the shareholders on a pro rata basis and in the open market.
Its repurchases by both means between 1930 and 1933 aggregated nearly 45% of the shares
outstanding at the end of 1929. Julian and Kokenge (Shoe) Company made pro rata repur-
chases of common stock in 1932, 1934 and 1939.

[586] SECURITY ANALYSIS
Abuse of Shareholders through Open-market Purchase of
Shares. During the 1930–1933 depression repurchases of their own
shares were made by many industrial companies out of their surplus cash
assets,6 but the procedure generally followed was open to grave objec-
tion. The stock was bought in the open market without notice to the
shareholders. This method introduced a number of unwholesome ele-
ments into the situation. It was thought to be “in the interest of the 
corporation” to acquire the stock at the lowest possible price. The con-
sequence of this idea is that those stockholders who sell their shares back
to the company are made to suffer as large a loss as possible, for the 
presumable benefit of those who hold on. Although this is a proper view-
point to follow in purchasing other kinds of assets for the business, there
is no warrant in logic or in ethics for applying it to the acquisition of
shares of stock from the company’s own stockholders. The management
is the more obligated to act fairly toward the sellers because the company
is itself on the buying side.
But, in fact, the desire to buy back shares cheaply may lead to a deter-
mination to reduce or pass the dividend, especially in times of general
uncertainty. Such conduct would be injurious to nearly all the stockhold-
ers, whether they sell or not, and it is for that reason that we spoke of the
repurchase of shares at an unconscionably low price as only presumably
to the advantage of those who retained their interest.
Example: White Motor Company. In the previous chapter attention
was called to the extraordinary discrepancy between the market level of
White Motor’s stock in 1931–1932 and the minimum liquidating value
of the shares. It will be instructive to see how the policies followed by the
management contributed mightily to the creation of a state of affairs so
unfortunate for the stockholders.
White Motor Company paid dividends of $4 per share (8%) practically
from its incorporation in 1916 through 1926. This period included the
depression year 1921, in which the company reported a loss of nearly
$5,000,000. It drew, however, upon its accumulated surplus 
to maintain the full dividend, a policy that prevented the price of 
the shares from declining below 29. With the return of prosperity the 
6 Figures published by the New Y ork Stock Exchange in February 1934 revealed that 259 
corporations with shares listed thereon had reacquired portions of their own stock.

quotation advanced to 721/2 in 1924 and 1041/2 in 1925. In 1926 the stock-
holders were offered 200,000 shares at par ($50), increasing the company’s
capital by $10,000,000. A stock dividend of 20% was paid at the same time.
Hardly had the owners of the business paid in this additional cash,
when the earnings began to shrink, and the dividend was reduced. In
1928 about $3 were earned (consolidated basis), but only $1 was dis-
bursed. In the 12 months ending June 30, 1931 the company lost about
$2,500,000. The next dividend payment was omitted entirely, and the
price of the stock collapsed to 7
1/2.
The contrast between 1931 and 1921 is striking. In the earlier year the
losses were larger, the profit-and-loss surplus was smaller and the cash
holdings far lower than in 1931. But in 1921 the dividend was maintained,
and the price thereby supported. A decade later, despite redundant hold-
ings of cash and the presence of substantial undistributed profits, a sin-
gle year’s operating losses sufficed to persuade the management to
suspend the dividend and permit the establishment of a grotesquely low
market price for the shares.
During the period before and after the omission of the dividend the
company was active in buying its own shares in the open market. These
purchases began in 1929 under a plan adopted for the benefit of “those
filling certain managerial positions. ” By June 1931 about 100,000 shares
had been bought in at a cost of $2,800,000. With the passing of the divi-
dend, the officers and employees were relieved of whatever obligations
they had assumed to pay for these shares, and the plan was dropped. In
the next six months, aided by the collapse in the market price, the com-
pany acquired 50,000 additional shares in the market at an average cost
of about $11 per share. The total holdings of 150,000 shares were then
retired and cancelled.
These facts, thus briefly stated, illustrate the vicious possibilities inher-
ent in permitting managements to exercise discretionary powers to pur-
chase shares with the company’s funds. We note first the painful contrast
between the treatment accorded to the White Motor managerial employ-
ees and to its stockholders. An extraordinarily large amount of stock was
bought for the benefit of these employees at what seemed to be an attrac-
tive price. All the money to carry these shares was supplied by the stock-
holders. If the business had improved, the value of the stock would have
advanced greatly, and all the benefits would have gone to the employees.

[588] SECURITY ANALYSIS
When things became worse, “those in managerial positions” were relieved
of any loss, and the entire burden fell upon the stockholders.7
In its transactions directly with its stockholders, we see White Motor
soliciting $10,000,000 in new capital in 1926. We see some of this addi-
tional capital (not needed to finance sales) employed to buy back many
of these very shares at one-fifth of the subscription price. The passing of
the dividend was a major factor in making possible these repurchases at
such low quotations. The facts just related without further evidence might
well raise a suspicion in the mind of a stockholder that the omission of
the dividend was in some way related to a desire to depress the price of
the shares. If the reason for the passing of the dividend was a desire to
preserve cash, then it is not easy to see why, since there was money avail-
able to buy in stock, there was not money available to continue a divi-
dend previously paid without interruption for 15 years.
The spectacle of a company overrich in cash passing its dividend, in
order to impel desperate stockholders to sell out at a ruinous price, is not
pleasant to contemplate.
Westmoreland Coal Company: Another Example.A more recent illus-
tration of the dubious advantage accruing to stockholders from a policy
of open-market repurchases of common stock is supplied by the case of
Westmoreland Coal. In the ten years 1929–1938 this company reported a
net loss in the aggregate amounting to $309,000, or $1.70 per share. How-
ever, these losses resulted after deduction of depreciation and depletion
allowances totaling $2,658,000, which was largely in excess of new capital
expenditures. Thus the company’s cash position actually improved con-
siderably during this period, despite payment of very irregular dividends
aggregating $4.10 per share.
In 1935, according to its annual reports, the company began to repur-
chase its own stock in the open market. By the end of 1938 it had thus
acquired 44,634 shares, which were more than 22% of the entire issue.
The average price paid for this stock was $8.67 per share. Note here the
extraordinary fact that this average price paid was less than one-half the
cash-asset holdings aloneper share, without counting the very large other
7 In the sale to Studebaker in 1933 the directors set aside 15,000 shares of treasury stock as a
donation to key men in the organization. Some White stockholders brought suit to set aside
this donation, and the suit was settled by payment of 31 cents per share on White stock not
acquired by Studebaker.

tangible assets. Note also that at no time between 1930 and 1939 did the
stock sell so high as its cash assets alone. (At the end of 1938 the com-
pany reported cash and marketable securities totaling $2,772,000, while
the entire stock issue was selling for $1,400,000.)
If this situation is analyzed, the following facts appear clear:
1. The low market price of the stock was due to the absence of earn-
ings and the irregular dividend. Under such conditions the quoted price
would not reflect the very large cash holding theoretically available for
the shares. Stocks sell on earnings and dividends and not on cash-asset
values—unless distribution of these cash assets is in prospect.
2. The true obligation of managements is to recognize the realities of
such a situation and to do all in their power to protect every stockholder
against unwarranted depreciation of his investment, and particularly
against unnecessary sacrifice of a large part of the true value of his shares.
Such sacrifices are likely to be widespread under conditions of this kind,
because many stockholders will be moved by necessity or the desire for
steady income or by a discouraged view of the coal industry to sell their
shares for what they can get.
3. The anomaly presented by exceptionally large cash holdings and an
absurdly low market price was obviously preventable. That the company
had more cash than it needed is confessed by the fact that it had money
available to buy in cheap stock—even if it were not evident from a study of
the unusual relationship between cash holdings and annual business done.
4. All cash that could possibly be spared should have been returned
to the stockholders on a pro rata basis. The use of some of it to buy in
shares as cheaply as possible is unjust to the many stockholders induced
by need or ignorance to sell. It favors those strong enough to hold their
shares indefinitely. It particularly advantages those in control of the
company, for in their case the company’s cash applicable to their stock
is readily available to them if they should need it (since they could then
bring about a distribution). Just because this situation is distinctly not
true of the rank and file of the stockholders, the market discounts so
cruelly the value of their cash when held by the company instead of
themselves.
8
8 Two additional factors in this situation deserve brief mention. The company had a rental
obligation of 10 cents per ton, but not less than $189,000 annually, for mining coal from leased
lands. This liability was an additional consideration, besides the ordinary ones, which argued

Summary and Conclusion. The relationship between stockholders
and their managements, after undergoing many unsound developments
during the hectic years from 1928 to 1933, have since been subjected to
salutary controls—emanating both from S.E.C. regulation and from a
more critical viewpoint generally. Certain elementary facts, once well-
nigh forgotten, might well be emphasized here: Corporations are in law
the mere creatures and property of the stockholders who own them; the
officers are only the paid employees of the stockholders; the directors,
however chosen, are virtually trustees, whose legal duty it is to act solely
in behalf of the owners of the business.
9
To make these general truths more effective in practice, it is necessary
that the stock-owning public be educated to a clearer idea of what are the
true interests of the stockholders in such matters as dividend policies,
expansion policies, the use of corporate cash to repurchase shares, the
various methods of compensating management, and the fundamental
question of whether the owners’ capital shall remain in the business or be
taken out by them in whole or in part.
for maintenance of a comfortable cash position, but it could not justify the immobilizing of far
more cash than the whole company appeared to be worth at any time between 1930 and 1939.
In October 1939 the company made application to the S.E.C. to terminate trading in its
shares on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the New Y ork Curb Exchange, intimating that
the infrequency of transactions might be responsible for their unduly low price. The reader
may judge whether or not, in the circumstances, the plight of the stockholders would be
relieved in any wise by destroying the established market for their shares. (The application
was later withdrawn.)
9 The management of American Telephone and Telegraph Company has repeatedly asserted
that it considers itself a trustee for the interests of stockholders, employees and the public, in
equal measure. A policy of this kind, if frankly announced and sincerely followed, can
scarcely be criticized in the case of a quasi-civic enterprise. But given the ordinary business
company, the issue is more likely to be whether the management is acting as trustees for the
stockholders or as trustees for the management.

Chapter 45
BALANCE-SHEET ANALYSIS (Concluded)
OUR DISCUSSION IN THE preceding chapters has related chiefly to situa-
tions in which the balance-sheet exhibit apparently justified a higher
price than prevailed in the market. But the more usual purpose of 
balance-sheet analysis is to detect the opposite state of affairs, viz., the
presence of financial weaknesses that may detract from the investment
or speculative merits of an issue. Careful buyers of securities scrutinize
the balance sheet to see if the cash is adequate, if the current assets bear 
a suitable ratio to the current liabilities, and if there is any indebted-
ness of near maturity that may threaten to develop into a refinancing 
problem.
WORKING-CAPITAL POSITION AND 
DEBT MATURITIES
Basic Rules Concerning Working Capital. Nothing useful may be
said here on the subject of how much cash a corporation should hold.
The investor must form his own opinion as to what is needed in any par-
ticular case and also as to how seriously an apparent deficiency of cash
should be regarded. On the subject of the working-capital ratio, a mini-
mum of $2 of current assets for $1 of current liabilities was formerly
regarded as a standard for industrial companies.
But since the late 1920’s a tendency towards a stronger current posi-
tion developed in most industries, and we find that the great majority of
industrial corporations show a ratio well in excess of 2 to 1.

tendency now to hold that a company falling below the average of its group

should be viewed with suspicion. 2 This idea seems to us to contain 
something of a logical fallacy, since it necessarily penalizes the lower half
of any group, regardless of how satisfactory the showing may be, consid-
ered by itself. We are unable to suggest a better figure than the old 2-to-1
criterion to use as a definite quantitative testof a sufficiently comfortable
financial position. Naturally the investor would favor companies that well
exceed this minimum requirement, but the problem is whether or not a
higher ratio must be exacted as a condition for purchase, so that an issue
otherwise satisfactory would necessarily be rejected if the current assets
are only twice current liabilities. We hesitate to suggest such a rule, nor do
we know what new figure to prescribe.
A second measure of financial strength is the so-called “acid test, ”
which requires that current assets exclusive of inventoriesbe at least equal
to current liabilities. Ordinarily the investor might well expect of a com-
pany that it meet both the 2-to-1 test and the acid test. If neither of these
criteria is met it would in most cases reflect strongly upon the investment
standing of a common-stock issue—as it would in the case of a bond or
preferred stock—and it would supply an argument against the security
from the speculative standpoint as well.

Balance-sheet Analysis. Implications of Asset Values [593]
The position of this company on June 30, 1933, was evidently much
less comfortable than a year before, and, judged by the usual standards,
it might appear somewhat overextended. But in this case the increase in
payables represented a return to the normal practice in the vegetable-oil
industry, under which fairly large seasonal borrowings are regularly
incurred to carry grain and flaxseed supplies. Upon investigation, there-
fore, the analyst would not consider the financial condition shown in the
1933 balance sheet as in any sense disturbing.
Contrasting examples on this point are supplied by Douglas Aircraft
Company and Stokely Brothers and Company in 1936–1938.

The situation in Douglas Aircraft in 1937 was not a seasonal matter, as
in the case of Archer-Daniels-Midland, but grew out of the receipt of cer-
tain types of orders requiring considerable working capital. Upon inquiry
the investor could have satisfied himself that the need for bank accommo-
dation was likely to be temporary and that, in any event, the new business
was sufficiently profitable to make any necessary financing an easy affair.
The Stokely picture was quite different, since the large current debt had

developed out of expanding inventories in an unprofitable market. Hence
the May 1937 balance sheet of Stokely carried a serious warning for the
preferred and common stockholder, as the table shows.
A year later Douglas Aircraft had paid off its bank loans and showed a
current ratio of 4 to 1. Stokely suspended preferred dividends in October
1938, and in that year the price of the issue fell from 21 (par $25) to 10.
As we pointed out in our discussion of bond selection (Chap. 13 on
accompanying CD), no standard requirements such as we have been dis-
cussing are recognized as applicable to railroads and public utilities. It must
not be inferred therefrom that the working-capital exhibit of these com-
panies is entirely unimportant—the contrary will soon be shown to be
true—but only that it is not to be tested by any cut-and-dried formulas.
Large Bank Debt Frequently a Sign of Weakness. Financial dif-
ficulties are almost always heralded by the presence of bank loans or of
other debt due in a short time. In other words, it is rare for a weak finan-
cial position to be created solely by ordinary trade accounts payable. This
does not mean that bank debt is a bad sign in itself; the use of a reason-
able amount of bank credit—particularly for seasonal needs—is not only
legitimate but even desirable. But, whenever the statement shows Notes
or Bills Payable, the analyst will subject the financial picture to a some-
what closer scrutiny than in cases where there is a “clean” balance sheet.
The postwar boom in 1919 was marked by an enormous expansion
of industrial inventories carried at high prices and financed largely by
bank loans. The 1920–1921 collapse of commodity prices made these
industrial bank loans a major problem. But the depression of the 1930’s
had different characteristics. Industrial borrowings in 1929 had been
remarkably small, due first to the absence of commodity or inventory
speculation and secondly to the huge sales of stock to provide additional
working capital. (Naturally there were exceptions, such as, notably, Ana-
conda Copper Mining Company which owed $35,000,000 to banks at
the end of 1929, increased to $70,500,000 three years later.) The large
bank borrowings were shown more frequently by the railroads and pub-
lic utilities. These were contracted to pay for property additions or to
meet maturing debt or—in the case of some railways—to carry unearned
fixed charges. The expectation in all these cases was that the bank loans
would be refunded by permanent financing; but in many instances such
refinancing proved impossible, and receivership resulted. The collapse

of the Insull system of public-utility holding companies was precipitated
in this way.
Examples: It is difficult to say exactly how apprehensively the investor
or speculator should have viewed the presence of $68,000,000 of bank
loans in the New Y ork Central balance sheet at the end of 1932 or the bills
payable of $69,000,000 owned by Cities Service Company on December
31, 1931. But certainly this adverse sign should not have been ignored.
The more conservatively minded would have taken it as a strong argu-
ment against any and all securities of companies in such a position, except
possibly issues selling at so low a price as to constitute an admitted but
attractive gamble. An improvement in conditions will, of course, permit
such bank loans to be refunded, but logic requires us to recognize that
the improvement is prospective whereas the bank loans themselves are
very real and very menacing.
3
When a company’s earnings are substantial, it rarely becomes insolvent
because of bank loans. But if refinancing is impracticable—as frequently it
was in the 1931–1933 period—the lenders may require suspension of div-
idends in order to make all the profits available to reduce the debt. It is for
this reason that the dividend on Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation
common was passed in 1932 and the preferred dividend of New Y ork Water
Service Corporation was passed in 1931, although both companies were
reporting earnings about as large as in previous years.
The 1937–1938 recession did not create corporate financial problems
comparable with those arising out of the two previous depressions. In this
respect there is a significant contrast between the stock markets of
1919–1921 and 1937–1938. For the decline in stock prices was actually
greater—both in dollars and percentagewise—in the recent period than
in the postwar collapse, although intrinsically the 1937–1938 downturn
was of much smaller importance, since it had relatively slight effect upon
the position of American corporations generally.
4 This may be taken as
a rather disquieting sign that stock prices have been growing more irra-
tionally sensitive to temporary fluctuations in business—a fact that we
3 Improvement in general business, plus easy money rates (plus in the case of railroads a
misguided optimism on the part of investors) enabled many companies to fund bank loans
that looked dangerous in 1931–1933.
4 The Stokely case is an exception to this statement, but there were surprisingly few of the kind.

are inclined to ascribe to the disappearance of the old-line distinctions
between stock investors and stock speculators.
Intercorporate Indebtedness. Current debt to a parent or to an 
affiliated company is theoretically as serious as any other short-term lia-
bility, but in practice it is rarely made the basis of an embarrassing claim
for payment.
Example: United Gas Corporation has owed $26,000,000 on open
account to its parent Electric Bond and Share Company since 1930—so
that it constantly reports a large excess of current liabilities over current
assets. Y et this debt has not prevented it from paying first preferred div-
idends in 1936–1939. In 1932, however, with somewhat larger earnings
than in 1939, it had been compelled to suspend the senior dividend
because it had large bank loans in addition to its intercompany debt. The
conservative buyer would naturally prefer to see the obligations to affili-
ates in some form other than a current liability.
The Danger of Early Maturing Funded Debt. A large bond issue
coming due in a short time constitutes a critical financial problem when
operating results are unfavorable. Investors and speculators should both
give serious thought to such a situation when revealed by a balance sheet.
Maturing funded debt is a frequent cause of insolvency.
Examples: Fisk Rubber Company was thrown into receivership by its
inability to pay off an $8,000,000 note issue at the end of 1930. The insol-
vency of Colorado Fuel and Iron Company and of the Chicago, Rock
Island and Pacific Railway Company in 1933 were both closely related to
the fact that large bond issues fell due in 1934. The heedlessness of spec-
ulators is well shown by the price of $54 established for Colorado Fuel
and Iron Preferred in June 1933, when its short-term bond issue (Col-
orado Industrial Company 5s, due 1934, guaranteed by the parent com-
pany) was selling at 45, an indicated yield of well over 100% per annum.
This price for the bonds was an almost certain sign of trouble ahead. Fail-
ure to meet the maturity would in all likelihood mean insolvency (for a
voluntary extension could by no means be counted upon) and the dan-
ger of complete extinction of the stock issues. It was typical of the spec-
ulator to ignore so obvious a hazard and typical also that he suffered a
large loss for his carelessness. (Two months later, on announcement of
the receivership, the price of the preferred stock dropped to 17
1/4.)

Balance-sheet Analysis. Implications of Asset Values [597]
New Y ork, Chicago, and St. Louis Railroad Company has been faced
with a continuous financial problem growing out of the sale of a three-
year note issue in 1929. Since the first maturity in 1932 it was repeatedly
extended under threat of receivership as an alternative. Typical of spec-
ulative disregard of financial problems was the advance of this company’s
preferred stock from 18
1/2 to 453/4 in 1939, against a low price that year
of only 50 for the notes due in 1941.
Even when the maturing debt can probably be taken care of in some
way, the possible cost of the refinancing must be taken into account.
Examples: This point is well illustrated by the $14,000,000 issue of
American Rolling Mill Company 41/2% Notes, due November 1, 1933. In
June 1933 the notes were selling at 80, which meant an annual yield basis
of about 75%. At the same time the common stock had advanced from 3
to 24 and then represented a total valuation for the common stock of over
$40,000,000. Speculators buying the stock because of improvement in the
steel industry failed to consider the fact that, in order to refund the notes
in the poor market than existing for new capital issues, a very attractive
conversion privilege would have to be offered. This would necessarily
react against the profit possibilities of the common stock. As it happened,
a new 5% note issue, convertible into stock at 25, was offered in exchange
for the 4
1/2% notes. The result was the establishment of a price of 101 for
the notes in August 1933 against a coincident price of 21 for the common
stock; and a price of 15 for the stock on November 1, 1933, when the
notes were taken care of at par.
The impending maturity of a bond issue is of importance to the hold-
ers of all the company’s securities, including mortgage debt ranking ahead
of the maturing issue. For even the prior bonds will in all likelihood be
seriously affected if the company is unable to take care of the junior issue.
This point is illustrated in striking fashion by the Fisk Rubber Company
First Mortgage 8s, due 1941. Although they were deemed to be superior
in their position to the 5
1/2% unsecured notes, their holders suffered
grievously from the receivership occasioned by the maturity of the 51/2s.
The price of the 8s declined from 115 in 1929 to 16 in 1932.5
Bank Loans of Intermediate Maturity. The combination of very 
low interest rates and the drying up of ordinary commercial bank loans has

[598] SECURITY ANALYSIS
produced a new phenomenon in recent years—the loaning of money to cor-
porations by banks, repayable over a period of several years. Most of this
money has been borrowed for the purpose of retiring bond issues (e.g., Com-
mercial Investment Trust Corporation in November 1939) and even pre-
ferred stock (e.g., Archer-Daniels-Midland Company in 1939). In some cases
such loans have been made for additional working capital (e.g., Western Auto
Supply Company in 1937) or to replace ordinary short-term bank credit (e.g.,
American Commercial Alcohol, Stokely Brothers). In most cases it is stipu-
lated or expected that the loans will be retired in annual installments.
From the standpoint of security analysis this bank credit resembles
the short-term notes that used to be sold to the public as a familiar part
of corporate financing. It must be considered partly equivalent to current
liabilities and partly to early maturing debt. It is not dangerous if either
the current-asset position is so strong that the loans could readily be
taken care of as current liabilities or the earning power is so large and
dependable as to make refinancing a simple problem. But if neither of
these conditions is present (as in the Stokely example on page 593), the
analyst must view the presence of a substantial amount of intermediate
bank debt as a potential threat to dividends or even to solvency.
It should not be necessary to dilate further upon the prime necessity
of examining the balance sheet for any possible adverse features in the
nature of bank loans or other short-term debt.
COMPARISON OF BALANCE SHEETS OVER 
A PERIOD OF TIME
This important part of security analysis may be considered under three
aspects, viz.:
1. As a check-up on the reported earnings per share.
2. To determine the effect of losses (or profits) on the financial position of
the company.
3. To trace the relationship between the company’s resources and its earn-
ing power over a long period.
Check-up on Reported Earnings per Share, Via the Balance

In addition to the foregoing the company wrote down its fixed assets
to $1 in 1933 by a charge of $19,301,000, of which $18,846,000 was taken
out of capital account and the balance out of surplus. To the extent that
depreciation charges since 1932 may have been insufficient because of
this write-down (see p. 495 on accompanying CD), the reported earnings
for the period were further overstated.

The foregoing analysis does not require extended discussion, since
most of the points involved were covered in Chaps. 31 to 36 (Chaps. 35–36
on accompanying CD). Virtually all the charges made to surplus between
1929 and 1938 (except for the write-down of the plant account to $1) rep-
resented a real diminution of the reported earning power of United States
Industrial Alcohol during this ten-year period. It seems likely, also, that
the surplus would have shrunk considerably farther if the plant account
had been carried at a proper figure and appropriate depreciation charged
against it since 1932. The fact that the company’s working capital
decreased by $3,192,000, despite receipt of $6,582,000 from the sale of
additional stock, is further evidence that, instead of there being a surplus
above dividends as reported, the company actually lost money before div-
idends during these ten years.

[602] SECURITY ANALYSIS
Despite the large reduction in the surplus of Plymouth Cordage during
these years, its financial position was even stronger at the end of the period
than at the beginning, and the liquidating value per share (as distinct from
book value) was probably somewhat higher. On the other hand, the losses
of Mallinson almost denuded it of working capital and thereby created an
extremely serious obstacle to a restoration of its former earning power.
Taking Losses on Inventories May Strengthen Financial Position. It is
obvious that losses that are represented solely by a decline in the inven-
tory account are not so serious as those which must be financed by an
increase in current liabilities. If the shrinkage in the inventory exceeds the
losses, so that there is an actual increase in cash or reduction in payables,
it may then be proper to say—somewhat paradoxically—that the com-
pany’s financial position has been strengthened even though it has been
suffering losses. This reasoning has a concrete application in analyzing
issues selling at less than liquidating value. It will be recalled that, in esti-
mating break-up value, inventories are ordinarily taken at about 50 to 75%
of the balance sheet figure, even though the latter is based on the lower of

cost or market. The result is that what appears as an operating loss in the
company’s statement may have the actual effect of a profit from the stand-
point of the investor who has valued the inventory in his own mind at con-
siderably less than the book figure. This idea is concretely illustrated in
the Manhattan Shirt Company example beginning on p. 602.
If we consider only the company’s figures there was evidently a loss for
the period, with a consequent shrinkage in the value of the common stock.
But if an investor had bought the stock, say, at $8 per share in 1930 (the low
price in that year was 6
1/8), he would more logically have appraised the
stock in his own mind on the basis of its liquidating value rather than its
book value. From his point of view, therefore, the intrinsic value of his hold-
ings would have increased during the depression period from $12.50 to
$14.75 per share, even after deducting the substantial dividends paid. What
really happened was that Manhattan Shirt turned the larger portion of its
assets into cash during these three years and sustained a much smaller loss
in so doing than a conservative buyer of the stock would have anticipated.
This accomplishment can be summarized in the table on p. 604.
We have here a direct contrast between the superficial indications of the
income account and the truer story told by the successive balance sheets.
Situations of this kind justify our repeated assertion that income-account
analysis must be supplemented and confirmed by balance-sheet analysis.

Is Shrinkage in Value of Normal Inventory an Operating Loss? A 
further question may be raised with respect to changes in the inventory
account, i.e., whether or not a mere reduction in the carrying priceshould
be regarded as creating an operating loss. In the case of Plymouth
Cordage we note the following comparative figures:
Assets turned into cash and “Expected loss” thereon and 
application of proceeds Amount application of difference

In the meantime the price of fibers had declined more than 50%, and
there was good reason to believe that the actual number of pounds of
fiber, rope and twine contained in the company’s inventory was not very
much smaller in 1932 than in 1929. At least half of the decline in the
inventory account was therefore due solely to the fall in unit prices. Did
this portion of the shrinkage in inventory values constitute an operating
loss? Could it not be argued that its fixed assets had suffered a similar
reduction in their appraisal value and that there was as much reason to
charge this shrinkage against earnings as to charge the shrinkage in the
carrying price of a certain physical amount of inventory?

Balance-sheet Analysis. Implications of Asset Values [605]
We have already discussed this point in our exposition of the “nor-
mal-stock” basis of inventory valuation (in Chap. 32), a method adopted
by Plymouth Cordage itself after 1932. In theory the analyst might
attempt to put all companies on a normal-stock basis for the purpose of
calculating their earning power exclusive of inventory fluctuations and
for uniform comparisons. Actually, he has not the data necessary for such
calculations. Hence he is reduced—here, as in many fields of analysis—
to the necessity of making general rather than exact allowance for the dis-
torting effect of inventory price changes.
Profits from Inventory Inflation. That the importance of inventory
price changes is not confined to a depression period is emphatically
shown by the events of 1919 and 1920. In 1919 the profits of industrial
companies were very large; in 1920 the reported earnings were irregular
but in the aggregate quite substantial. Y et the gains shown in these two
years were in many cases the result of an inventory inflation, i.e., a huge
and speculative advance in commodity prices. Not only was the authen-
ticity of these profits thereby made open to question, but the situation
was replete with danger because of the large bank loans contracted to
finance these overvalued inventories.
Examples: The following tabulation, which covers a number of the
leading industrial companies, will bring out the significant contrast
between the apparently satisfactory earnings developments and the

Balance-sheet Analysis. Implications of Asset Values [607]
The United States Rubber figures for 1919–1920 present the complete
reverse of Manhattan Shirt’s exhibit for 1930–1932. In the Rubber 
example we have large earnings but a coincident deterioration of the finan-
cial position due to heavy expenditures on plant and a dangerous expan-
sion of inventory. The stock buyer would have been led astray completely
had he confined his attention solely to United States Rubber’s reported
earnings of nearly $20 per share in 1920; and, conversely, the securities
markets were equally mistaken in considering only the losses reported
during 1930–1932, without reference to the favorable changes occurring
at the same time in the balance-sheet position of many companies.
It will be noted from our discussion here and in Chap. 32 that the mat-
ter of inventory profits or losses belongs almost equally in the field of
income account and of balance-sheet analysis.
Long-range Study of Earning Power and Resources. The third
aspect of the comparison of successive balance sheets is of restricted inter-
est because it comes into play only in an exhaustive study of a company’s
record and inherent characteristics. The purpose of this kind of analysis
may best be conveyed by means of the following applications to the long-
term exhibits of United States Steel Corporation and Corn Products
Refining Company.

The balance sheets are adjusted to exclude an intangible item (“water”),
amounting to $508,000,000, originally added to the Fixed Property
Account. This was subsequently written off between 1902 and 1929 
by means of an annual sinking-fund charge (aggregating $182,000,000)
and by special appropriations from surplus. The sinking-fund charges in
question are also eliminated from the income account.

[610] SECURITY ANALYSIS
The Significance of the Foregoing Figures. The three decades had,
superficially at least, a somewhat equal distribution of good years and
bad. In the first decade 1904 and 1908 were depression years, while 1911
and 1912 were subnormal. The second period had three bad years, viz.,
1914, 1921 and 1922—the last due to high costs rather than to small vol-
ume. The third decade was made up of eight years of prosperity followed
by two of unprecedented depression.
The figures show that the war period, which occurred in the middle
decade, was a windfall for United States Steel and added more than 300 mil-
lions to profits, as compared with the rate established in the first ten years.
On the other hand, the last ten years were marked by a drastic falling off in
the rate of earnings on the invested capital. The difference between the 5.2%
actually earned and the 8% that might be regarded as a satisfactory annual
average amounted to close to 600 million dollars for the ten-year period.
Viewing the picture from another angle, we note that in the thirty years
the actual investment in United States Steel Corporation was more than
doubled and its productive capacity was increased threefold. Y et the aver-
age annual production was only 27% higher, and the average annual earn-
ings before interest charges were only 12% higher, in 1923–1932 than in
1903–1912. This analysis would serve to raise the question: (1) if, since the
end of the war, steel production has been transformed from a reasonably
prosperous into a relatively unprofitable industry and (2) if this transfor-
mation is due in good part to excessive reinvestment of earnings in addi-
tional plant, thus creating a condition of overcapacity with resultant
reduction in the margin of profit.
Postscript. The soundness of the foregoing analysis, made in 1933,
may be judged by developments since then. It should be pointed out that
both the plant account figures and the annual earnings should be adjusted
downward in the light of the later disclosures, viz.: (1) segregation from
plant account in 1937 of $269,000,000 (and write-off of this amount in
1938), representing intangible assets at organization in addition to the
$508,000,000 written off to 1929; (2) a charge to surplus of $270,000,000
in 1935 for additional amortization of fixed assets, presumably applica-
ble to the entire preceding period. These later revisions, however, do not
affect in any essential degree the conclusions drawn above.
The showing of United States Steel in the years since 1932 would
appear to bear out the pessimistic implications of the 1933 study. During
the six years 1934–1939, which is most instances supply a fair test period

Comment on the Corn Products Refining Company Exhibit.The early
period was one of subnormal earnings, which would have been still
poorer if more nearly adequate depreciation charges had been made. As
in the case of United States Steel, the war period brought enormous earn-
ings to Corn Products. The decade 1916–1925 was marked as a whole by
a great increase in working capital and a substantial reduction in funded
debt and preferred stock. Depreciation charges exceeded expenditures on
new plant.
In the 1926–1935 period we note a striking divergence from the
exhibit of United States Steel for 1923–1932. Despite inclusion of the
depression years Corn Products was almost able to increase its earning
power proportionately with its enlarged capital investment. Its annual
profits (both before and after depreciation) were about four times as large
in this decade as in the period ending in 1915. (If we use the same years
for comparison, we shall find that United States Steel actually earned less
in 1926–1935 than in 1906–1915.) The balance-sheet changes were

2. Bonds outstanding are increased in 1906 and 1912 to reflect liability for issues of subsidiaries.
Plant, etc., is increased in the same amounts.
3. Estimates considered to be sufficiently accurate are used in the initial balance sheet.
4. Deductions for bond interest are partly estimated for the first two periods.
5. The adjustments of Common Stock, Surplus, and Reserves represent chiefly changes in Mis-
cellaneous Reserves and shrinkage of marketable securities.

to the liberal depreciation charged) but by a larger increase in the invest-
ment in affiliated companies—indicating a broad expansion of the com-
pany’s activities.
It is clear that the record of Corn Products Refining Company does
not suggest the same questions or doubts as arise from an examination
of the United States Steel Corporation’s exhibit.

Introduction to Part VII
THE GREAT ILLUSION OF THE STOCK MARKET
AND THE FUTURE OF VALUE INVESTING
BY DAVID ABRAMS
I
n value-investing circles, you meet many people who claim to have
been inspired by what Benjamin Graham and David Dodd wrote in
Security Analysis. Most are, at the very least, stretching the truth. A fair
number of aspiring and practicing value investors may indeed have
devoured The Intelligent Investor. But I would wager that few have actually
dug deeply into Security Analysis and fewer still have read the classic
cover to cover. I have to confess that although I had delved into various
parts of Security Analysis, I had never read it from first page to last. So
when I was asked to write an introduction to Part VII, which comprises the
last hundred pages of the book, it was time to do my homework. After
more than 20 years as an investment professional, I finally read the value
investors’ equivalent of Deuteronomy. Entitled “Additional Aspects of
Security Analysis. Discrepancies between Price and Value, ” Part VII covers
a lot of ground: the valuation of warrants; the potential decrease in the
value of a company’s common stock when it issues options to manage-
ment; the shortcomings of relative value analysis; and the greed of invest-
ment bankers. In the 75 years since the original edition was published,
both the world at large and the financial markets have undergone cata-
clysmic change. Yet, as Graham and Dodd understood, how markets
work, how companies are run, and how people—both investors and cor-
porate managers—tend to act in certain situations never change.

The world likes to categorize things, including investing styles, in
neat little boxes. So it is that the financial media frequently label market
participants as “value, ” “growth, ” or “momentum” investors. That’s all fine,
but I can tell you that I’ve observed a great many investors over the
years, and I’ve never seen a consistently successful one whose strategy
was not based on a value approach—paying less for something than it is
worth, either today or in the future. True, some people like to buy things
that will grow and others are drawn to assets that beckon from the bar-
gain counter, while still others like to engage in arbitrage activities, buy-
ing one thing and selling another to profit on the price differential, or
spread. But every successful investor I’ve ever known makes a calculation
that compares an asset’s purchase pric e to its present or future value.
Whatever their approach, countless investors have used the princi-
ples laid out in Security Analysis to uncover bargains. Scads of people
have become wealthy doing so, including many of the contributors to
this revised edition, not to mention all the people who were smart
enough to buy Berkshire Hathaway years ago. Their success is a testa-
ment to value investing’s glorious past. But what about its future? Is the
road ahead bright and prosperous? Or is it bleak and beggarly? Are there
more people practicing Ben Graham’s underlying principles than there
are bargains for them to find? Is there just too much money chasing a
finite supply of bargains? Or might a serious security analyst still be able
to prosper over time?
I am optimistic about the future of value investing. To be sure, there
are many bright and savvy people in the financial markets employing
Graham and Dodd’s techniques, but the markets themselves have grown
exponentially. The chunk of capital being invested by the value-investing
crowd is a small percentage of the overall capitalization of global finan-
cial markets. Having observed the markets for more than two decades,
my sense is that, rather than a glut of Graham and Dodd acolytes picking
through scarce opportunities to find a place for their cash, money is ever

more prone to sloshing around in giant waves, flowing from one fad to
the next. If anything, it seems that the people controlling these mega-
sums have become less intelligent and less sophisticated over time. The
last decade alone has brought incredible extremes in valuation, starting
in 1999 and 2000 with the high-altitude Internet bubble that was fol-
lowed in short order by the utter collapse of the tech market. In the sum-
mer of 2002, we witnessed a tremendous corporate debt meltdown. But
soon, these excessively low valuations were pushed off the front pages
by the most generous and lax lending standards of all time. Now, as I
write this introduction, the mortgage market is imploding, creating per-
haps yet another new set of opportunities. That we’ve seen the last of
these extreme swings seems doubtful.
What is driving this manic phenomenon? The explanation is some-
thing I call the “Great Illusion of the Stock Market. ” Investing looks easy,
particularly in a world of inexpensive software and online trading. Buy-
ing a stock is no more difficult than buying a book on Amazon.com. And
because a great many people have gotten wealthy in the stock market,
lots of others have come to believe that anyone can get rich with very
little effort. They are wrong. All the people I know who’ve built wealth in
the stock market have worked very hard at it. Graham and Dodd under-
stood the effort it took to be successful in the market. They wrote:
Since we have emphasized that analysis will lead to a positive conclusion
only in the exceptional case, it follows that many securities must be
examined before one is found that has real possibilities for the analyst.
By what practical means does he proceed to make his discoveries?
Mainly by hard and systematic work. (p. 669)
So, yes, you can get rich buying and selling stocks, but, as the authors
well knew, it takes hard work and patience. Nevertheless, the Great Illu-
sion persists, maybe because, like Woody Allen’s film character Zelig, the
market is a chameleon that changes its appearance to suit the times.
Sometimes, it shows up as a tech stock bubble. Other times, it manifests

itself as a ludicrously overvalued stock market as seen in the late 1980s
in Japan. In a current incarnation, a raft of financial institutions across
America are trying to emulate the success of David Swensen and his col-
leagues who manage Yale University’s endowment by allocating large
percentages of the capital to “alternative investment managers. ”
But the Great Illusion is just that—an illusion. If you want to get
wealthy in the financial markets, you’ll need to engage in “hard and sys-
tematic work. ” And for that, many sections of Part VII of Security Analysis
are still essential. Given the drastic changes in the world since the book
first appeared, it should come as no surprise that some of the material is
no longer relevant for today’s investor, and these shortcomings bear
mentioning. So as we take a quick tour through this part, I’ll point out
some deficiencies along with the authors’ nuggets of wisdom that still
ring true.
One of the shortcomings shows up early in the first chapter of Part
VII, in Chapter 46, “Stock-option Warrants, ” which is on the accompany-
ing CD. This chapter may well be the most dated. When the book was
first published, the derivatives market was still in its infancy. Fischer Black
and Myron Scholes had not yet developed their famous formula for valu-
ing stock options, and the products that now pervade the financial mar-
kets—options, interest rate futures, swaps, swaptions, and so on—were
not fixtures in the financial markets. Chapter 46 homes in on stock war-
rants, one of the few derivative securities available at that time. The
authors make some good points with their few specific examples, but
their analysis is not sophisticated enough for today’s world.
Take their example of Barnsdall Oil warrants. Graham and Dodd cor-
rectly conclude that these warrants were undervalued because the mar-
ket priced them at their intrinsic value. It’s not terribly relevant in today’s
world because such mispricing wouldn’t last long. Besides pointing out
the obvious—it’s better to own a warrant trading at its intrinsic value
[620] Introduction to Part VII

**[Page 673]**

David Abrams [621]
than to own the underlying stock—Graham and Dodd note the leverage
inherent in warrants and options. This analysis is good as far as it goes,
but it just doesn’t go far enough. The authors were able to identify that
the Barnsdall Oil warrants were mispriced relative to the common stock,
but they weren’t able to provide the reader with an intellectual frame-
work or the tools needed to value the warrants properly.
I should make it clear that just because an asset is overvalued or
undervalued, it’s not necessarily a good idea to try to capitalize on that
mispricing. If the derivatives market fully understands the misvaluation
of the underlying security, there is no particular edge to owning the
derivative. However, if the market undervalues the derivatives on a mis-
priced security or group of securities, the odds to the derivative investor
can be very favorable. In effect, the investor benefits from the double
leverage of two mispriced securities—the underlying and the derivative.
Although such a situation doesn’t arise often, it can be particularly prof-
itable. The ability to capture the compound mispricings can lead to
extraordinary profits.
Perhaps the most famous example of this phenomenon occurred in
the late 1980s, when the Japanese stock market rose to greater and
greater heights, ultimately reaching an absurd level of overvaluation.
While some believed that this was a “new era” in which Japan would eco-
nomically dominate the world, value investors took a different view,
believing instead that it was simply a case of a financial bubble that
would ultimately correct itself. On Wall Street, there was a growing and
widespread understanding that the Japanese stock market would even-
tually decline to more reasonable and rational levels, which spelled
opportunity for those able to capitalize on what promised to be a dra-
matic price movement.
Against this backdrop, options sellers were, amazingly, willing to offer
puts on the Nikkei Index at a remarkably cheap price. I remember asking

[622] Introduction to Part VII
the brokers who sold these options, “Who is taking the other side of
these trades?” “European institutions, ” they said, which is the standard
reply of Wall Street brokers who don’t want to tell you what’s really
going on. In the end, it turned out that much of the exposure was held
by Japanese financial institutions that were so confident their market
would never go down that they wrote these multiyear contracts and
took the entire premium into income immediately. Ultimately, the
Japanese market collapsed, and my then employer, along with many
other U.S. investors, profited handsomely as the puts soared in value.
More recently, the derivatives market in asset-backed securities of
subprime mortgages offered a similarly distorted risk-reward equation in
the form of credit default swaps (CDSs). These securities are a series of
puts on bonds backed by subprime mortgages on residential property.
When the bonds were issued, they were viewed by both investors and
the rating agencies as safe (that is, investment grade) because of the
assumptions about how these mortgages would perform. However,
some astute investors realized that the underlying collateral was much
riskier and subject to far more downside than the buyers originally
assumed when they purchased CDSs on subprime bonds and indexes.
When the subprime market collapsed in 2007, some of these securities
increased in value more than 50 or 60 times the amount at risk. Every
trade always has two sides, so it helps if you can figure out the thought
process of the person on the opposite side of the trade. Warren Buffett
once wrote: “If you’ve been in the poker game for 30 minutes and you
don’t know who the patsy is, you’re the patsy. ”
“Work It Out”
Like Graham and Dodd, my own initial approach to the derivatives mar-
ket was rather simplistic, and I well remember the day my young eyes
were opened to the perils and pitfalls of my naiveté.

---
**[Page 675]**

It was the early 1980s and I was just starting out on Wall Street. Deriv-
atives were still a mostly nascent market, and stock options were among
the first of these instruments to attract much attention. Like Graham and
Dodd and many others on the Street, I grasped the leveraged nature of
stock options and how they could be used to magnify the gains (or
losses) of an individual stock position. But my knowledge beyond the
basics was scant. I was working in the risk arbitrage department of a firm
that did a lot of options arbitrage. And although I didn’t yet understand
what that meant, I did understand that the guys sitting next to me were
making a lot of money doing it. What is more, they seemed to come in
just before the market opened, left promptly right after the market
closed, and never even glanced at the Wall Street Journal, preferring
instead to read the gossipy New York Post. My curiosity was aroused. So
one day I asked Ira, the head of the firm, to explain to me what he did.
The two-minute conversation that followed forever changed the way I
looked at derivatives and profoundly affected the way I’ve approached
unfamiliar areas in finance and business ever since.
Ira pointed to a stock (I can’t remember which one, although it could
easily have been IBM since, in those days, the sun on Wall Street literally
rose and set on whatever IBM was doing) and asked me this question:
“What if you buy the $35 calls, sell the $40 calls, buy the $40 puts, and
sell the $35 puts all at the same time?” My first thought was, “You’ve got
a mess, ” but I didn’t say that. I simply looked baffled. Seeing my confu-
sion, he said, “Work it out. What’s it worth at expiration?” After a few min-
utes with pencil and paper, I looked up, still a bit confused, and said, “It’s
always worth $5. ” “Right, ” he said. But still the light did not flicker in my
brain until Ira asked, “What if you could buy it for $4.50?” Bingo! I finally
got it. Even though I was new to Wall Street, I had done enough arbi-
trage to understand what Ira was saying. Typically, the most liquid
option contracts are those with expiration dates relatively close by;

**[Page 676]**

which means that if you could buy this “box, ” as it is called, consisting of
two pairs of options for $4.50, you would make a guaranteed 11% on
your money in less than six months.
It was my turn to pose a question. “Can you really buy them for
$4.50?” I asked. “Sometimes, ” he said. And then I realized who had been
the proverbial patsy in the poker game. It was me. By relying on Graham
and Dodd’s overly simplistic approach to the options market and not
fully understanding the mathematics of the instruments in which I was
investing, I didn’t appreciate how the trade might look to the person on
the other side. I was ripe for the picking, as they say. Perhaps my trades
had been the other side of someone’s buying a box for $4.50. I realized
that, in all likelihood, the guy on the other side was probably smarter
than I was. Embarrassed by my own ignorance, I vowed to wade into
new situations with a greater respect for those on the other side of the
trade and with more humility about the limits of my own knowledge.
Never again would I be the patsy. That approach has served me well
throughout my career.
Unlike the world in which Graham and Dodd lived and worked,
today’s security analyst is at a disadvantage without a good understand-
ing of how option pricing models work and what their limitations are.
Not only are derivatives pervasive in the financial markets but many cor-
porations and investment entities use them for purposes both prudent
and reckless.
As I continued to acquire experience and learned more about options
and the models used to value them, I became aware of a major weak-
ness in options theory. By and large, the academic work underpinning
derivatives analysis, work that so many on Wall Street rely on, is predi-
cated on the assumption that the markets are “efficient. ” The authors of
Security Analysis would have had a good time arguing with these aca-
demics. They understood that the underlying premise of efficiency is not
always true, writing:
[624] Introduction to Part VII

**[Page 677]**

Evidently the processes by which the securities market arrives at its
appraisals are frequently illogical and erroneous. These processes, as we
pointed out in our first chapter, are not automatic or mechanical but
psychological, for they go on in the minds of people who buy and sell.
(p. 669)
Ahead of their time when it came to the question of market effi-
ciency, Graham and Dodd weren’t able to foresee a need for the more
complex mathematical relationships pointed out by my boss. They
looked only at the relationship between the derivative security and the
underlying instrument, which made for a somewhat primitive method
of warrant analysis. Nevertheless, they did possess a keen understand-
ing of how option and warrant issuance can affect the future value of
the issuing company’s common stock. In fact, they understood it better
than many of today’s accountants and Wall Street analysts. In a subsec-
tion entitled “A Dangerous Device for Diluting Stock Values, ” the
authors write,
The public’s failure to comprehend that all the value of option warrants is
derived at the expense of the common stock has led to a practice that
would be ridiculous if it were not so mischievous. (p. 653 on accompany-
ing CD)
Those words could just as easily have been penned any time in the
last decade, as some of the compensation schemes recently adopted at
certain corporations have been shortchanging shareholders by masking
the dilutive impact and inflating the income statement.
Until recently, companies recorded no expense on their income state-
ments for the cost of options issued to management and directors. A
couple of years ago, the rules were changed, and Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles (GAAP) began requiring companies to use one of
several methods to value the cost of their stock options. It’s a big
improvement over the prior practice of recording no expense, but the
David Abrams [625]

---
**[Page 678]**

methods mandated by GAAP are the same as those used by analysts to
value derivatives not issued by the company. Clearly, something is amiss.
There is a huge difference between derivative contracts with third par-
ties that do not result in more shares being issued and company-issued
options that increase the number of its shares outstanding in the future,
thereby diluting the interests of the current stockholders. Long-term
shareholders need to fully appreciate the impact of these options issued
by corporations to management; otherwise they’ll find themselves short-
changed in the years to come.
Beware of the Investment Bankers!
Moving on to Chapter 47, “Cost of Financing and Management, ” Gra-
ham and Dodd might more aptly have named it, “Beware of the Invest-
ment Bankers!” As the saying goes, “The more things change, the more
they stay the same. ” Or, as a friend once told me with regard to conflicts
of interest on Wall Street, “Where there’s no conflict, there’s no interest. ”
The reader will find it interesting to learn about ancient abuses at the
hands of investment bankers, while the folks at Goldman Sachs and Mor-
gan Stanley may shed a few tears of nostalgia when they read about the
good old days of 20% underwriting spreads on the likes of American
Bantam Car Corporation Convertible Preference Stock. But the last page
of the chapter really stands out for its enduring relevance. Graham and
Dodd wrote,
The relaxation of investment bankers’ standards in the late 1920s, and
their use of ingenious means to enlarge their compensation, had
unwholesome repercussions in the field of corporate management.
Operating officials felt themselves entitled not only to handsome salaries
but also to a substantial participation in the profits of the enterprise. . . .
But it may not be denied that devious and questionable means were fre-
quently employed to secure these large bonuses to the management
without full disclosure of their extent to the stockholders. . . . With pub-
[626] Introduction to Part VII

---
**[Page 679]**

licity given to this compensation, we believe that the self-interest of
stockholders may be relied on fairly well to prevent it from passing all
reasonable limits. (p. 642)
So many of the recent excesses—from the Internet bubble to the
leveraged buyout craze to the subprime mortgage fiasco—bear more
than a passing resemblance to the shenanigans Graham and Dodd
described years ago. And while the pair probably would not have been
surprised at some of the excessive compensation at the corporate level,
they likely would have been shocked that these excesses reached into
the management of the New York Stock Exchange itself. Today’s investors
would do well to view Wall Street with at least the same degree of
reproach and skepticism our authors exhibited in their writings.
Jumping ahead, Chapter 50, “Discrepancies between Price and
Value, ” and Chapter 51, “Discrepancies between Price and Value (Contin-
ued), ” are among the gems of Part VII, and anyone interested in invest-
ing should read them. They provide the reader with a useful list of dos
and don’ts, places to look for value, and traps to avoid, illustrated by
examples from the 1930s. Many of us have a tendency to romanticize
the past, and when investors engage in such fond reminiscence, they
often speak wistfully of Graham’s era. Oh, for a return to the days when
stocks sold at seven times earnings and less than working capital! And I
must admit that when I read the Group A list in Chapter 50, I, too, felt a
twinge of envy. How easy it must have been to be an investor in the
late 1930s!
But wait a minute, I thought. I’ ve encountered numerous opportuni-
ties in my own lifetime that would have made Graham green with envy.
The truth is that, from time to time, financial markets present opportuni-
ties to buy assets that have remarkable risk-reward characteristics. It can
be described only as the best of all worlds when an investor has the
chance to make a decent amount of money in the worst case and oodles

in the best case. My personal list begins with the Management Assistance
Liquidating Trust—perhaps my first true value investment—and includes
Public Service of New Hampshire 18% second mortgage bonds trading at
par; Executive Life Muni GICs trading at 25 cents on the dollar in the
wake of a trial court judge’s decision later declared on appeal to have “no
basis in law or reason”; and Gentiva common stock, a spin-off resulting
from a merger that was trading at about a third of its working capital.
Around the same time Ira was enlightening me about the options
market, my friend Chris Stavrou introduced me to Management Assis-
tance Liquidating Trust when he faxed me the 10-Q, adorned with his
handwritten notes. As he walked me through, I could see exactly what
he saw: a stock trading at $2 that was worth $4. What’s more, the com-
pany was now obligated to pay out to shareholders all the proceeds
from the sale of its assets. Knowing that this was a certain double, I
promptly sold all my other holdings and put 100% of my assets (all
$10,000 worth) into this one stock. My only regret is that I didn’t buy any
for my company because I was afraid my boss, who was on vacation at
the time, would disapprove of the investment.
One of the most recent and spectacular sets of opportunities
occurred in mid-2002, amid the epic meltdown in the corporate bond
market. Bargains were there for the taking—left, right, and center. Cor-
porate bond market investors that year had stories galore. Mine was the
AES 10.25% Senior Subordinated Notes, which traded as low as 15 cents
on the dollar. At that price, the current yield was close to 66%. AES was a
complex company with assets all over the world. Furthermore, it was
financed in a nontraditional way with a combination of project-specific
debt as well as corporate debt of different levels of seniority. The high
degree of leverage combined with the complexity of the asset base
caused the market to be concerned that the company would be forced
into bankruptcy. Our analysis led us to the conclusion that there was
more than sufficient value and cash flow to cover the debt. As it turned
[628] Introduction to Part VII

**[Page 681]**

out, we were correct. These bonds never missed a payment and were
called at par within a year of hitting their lows. Talk about a windfall!
Surely, Ben Graham would have marveled at the bond market’s tempo-
rary insanity in the summer of 2002.
As I continued reading through Part VII, I was particularly and
delightedly struck by the authors’ use of the English language. Their abil-
ity to express ideas cogently and clearly has seldom been matched in
the field of finance, with the exception of perhaps their best and most
famous student, Warren Buffett. After all, it was Graham and Dodd who
created the parable of a manic Mr. Market, the gentleman who may be
your friend or your enemy but who is someone whose advice you should
never accept. A great example of their effective use of language is found
in the discussion of the shortcomings of “market analysis. ”
It was also Graham and Dodd who coined the term “margin of safety, ”
which has special relevance for the investment professionals who con-
tributed to this edition of the book. All of us are fundamental analysts
who examine securities one at a time, weighing the risk and reward
characteristics of each investment at a particular price. While we may,
from time to time, have views on where the stock market is headed, we
generally do not make bets on its direction. Our reasons are many, but I
think Graham and Dodd said it best when they wrote in Chapter 52:
In market analysis there are no margins of safety; you are either right or
wrong, and if you are wrong, you lose money. (p. 703)
That really sums it up nicely, doesn’t it? Yet, all these years later, many
investors are still consumed with formulating their own market view.
Wall Street’s finest firms employ market strategists, and many investors,
professional and otherwise, are eager to hear those views. This, I submit,
is simply more evidence that the Great Illusion persists.
In the very last chapter, Graham and Dodd offer advice to different
groups of market participants, among them the small investor, the 
David Abrams [629]

---
**[Page 682]**

well-heeled investor, and the institutional investor. How has their advice
held up?
For the small investor interested in income, the authors felt that the
only suitable investment was U.S. government savings bonds. The securi-
ties performed as promised, of course, but there were a couple of devel-
opments that Graham and Dodd did not and could not foresee. First and
foremost were the ravaging effects of inflation in the late 1970s and
early 1980s. The inflationary spiral ultimately led to higher interest rates
and large losses for bond investors. Second was the expansion of the
fixed income markets and the proliferation of innumerable fixed income
securities that created opportunities for value investing in the bond mar-
ket for those willing to sift through vast numbers of similar instruments
in search of anomalous pricing.
Graham and Dodd advised profit-seeking investors, both large and
small, to purchase securities trading below their intrinsic value, and they
suggested that investors submit their analytical work for critique by oth-
ers. In essence, they were recommending that investors should all
become part-time security analysts. Writing in the aftermath of the 1929
crash and ensuing Great Depression, the prospect of the kind of financial
market profitability we’ve seen in recent years was unimaginable. In
today’s hypercompetitive world, it may be possible to succeed as a part-
time investor, but it’s not something I’d recommend. And if you don’t
want to devote yourself full-time to researching investments, you’re
probably better off engaging some professional assistance.
The prolific pair also advised institutions to invest solely in fixed
income investments, if doing so would fulfill their needs. Fortunately, for
universities such as Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, men such as Jack
Meyer, David Swensen, and Andy Golden didn’t follow that advice. And
because of it, those institutions have far more resources at their disposal
today than they would have otherwise. Thanks to the insight and inde-
[630] Introduction to Part VII

**[Page 683]**

pendent thinking of these individuals, their respective institutions all
have endowments measured in the tens of billions that give them a
huge and perhaps permanent competitive advantage over many of their
less wealthy peers. Beyond any specific advice that Graham and Dodd
offered, the most important point investors should take away from Secu-
rity Analysis is this: look at the numbers and think for yourself. All the
great investors do, and that’s what makes them great.
Interestingly enough, one group of investors was left out when Gra-
ham and Dodd were dispensing advice in the last chapter of Security
Analysis. They had nary a word for all the young people starting out in
financial careers that they undoubtedly hoped would bring them fortune
and happiness, if not fame. To rectify that oversight, I offer a few last
words of advice to this group. Many of my collaborators on this project
are, like me, investment professionals who were once in your shoes—
young, new to Wall Street, with little if any money in our bank accounts,
but armed with energy, hope, and a good work ethic. We feel a particu-
larly strong kinship with you. I think all of us would agree that we made
a great career choice. And although we may initially have been moti-
vated by the money, it’s been a long time since the accumulation of
wealth was the force that sends us into the office each day. We do what
we do because we enjoy it. We relish the challenge, the stimulation, and
the satisfaction that comes with finding the next bargain the market has
to offer.
A number of years ago some professors at the University of Chicago
concluded that Graham and Dodd had it all wrong. The market, they
said, was efficient. In effect, they told aspiring analysts such as you:
“Don’t bother. Don’t waste your time. The market is too efficient for you
to be rewarded by your effort. Find something else to do with your life. ”
For a long time, it was fashionable for people in financial circles to
debate this topic, with the professors marshaling arguments in favor of
David Abrams [631]

---
**[Page 684]**

their position and the practitioners insisting they were wrong, often
pointing to the many aberrations that could not be explained by the
academic theories. 
Recently, the debate has died down, or perhaps it’s just that the prac-
titioners are too busy making money, too busy unearthing the next mis-
priced security, to find the time to argue anymore. As rewarding as our
careers have been, I think all of us would tell you that it’s been a con-
stant intellectual challenge to understand an ever-changing and increas-
ingly global financial world in a competition that draws many
exceptionally talented, bright, and hardworking entrants. But it is just
such rigorous competition among colleagues and friends that brings out
the best in us. I, for one, feel fortunate to have met so many intellectually
curious, hardworking, and motivated people during my time on Wall
Street.
And so, to the aspiring young analyst, I can tell you that the answer
to the question of the market’s efficiency or lack thereof is clear: The
market is inefficient enough. “Enough for what?” you ask. Inefficient
enough for me—and you—to find some great opportunities from time
to time. Not every day or every week, but often enough. The Great Illu-
sion persists, leaving plenty of opportunities for those who wish to do
the hard, sometimes boring, and often tedious work of value investing.
Happy hunting!

Chapter 47
COST OF FINANCING
AND MANAGEMENT
LET US CONSIDER IN MORE DETAIL the organization and financing of Petro-
leum Corporation of America, mentioned in the last chapter. This was a
large investment company formed for the purpose of specializing in secu-
rities of enterprises in the oil industry. The public was offered 3,250,000
shares of capital stock at $34 per share. The company received therefore
a net amount of $31 per share, or $100,750,000 in cash. It issued to
unnamed recipients—presumably promoters, investment bankers and the
management—warrants, good for five years, to buy 1,625,000 shares of
additional stock, also at $34 per share.
This example is representative of the investment trust financing of the
period. Moreover, as we shall see, the technique on this score that devel-
oped in boom years was carried over through the ensuing depression, and
it threatened to be accepted as the standard practice for stock financing of
all kinds of enterprises. But there is good reason to ask the real meaning
of a set-up of this kind, first, with respect to what the buyer of the stock
gets for his money, and second, with respect to the position occupied by
the investment banking houses floating these issues.
Cost of Management; Three Items. A new investment trust—such
as Petroleum Corporation in January 1929—starts with two assets: cash
and management. Buyers of the stock at $34 per share were asked to pay
for the management in three ways, viz.:
1. By the difference between what the stock cost them and the amount
received by the corporation.
It is true that this difference of $3 per share was paid not to the man-
agement but to those underwriting and selling the shares. But from the
standpoint of the stock buyer the only justification for paying more for

**[Page 686]**

the stock than the initial cash behind it would lie in his belief that the
management was worth the difference.
2. By the value of the option warrants issued to the organizing interests.
These warrants in essence entitled the owners to receive one-third of
whatever appreciation might take place in the value of the enterprise over
the next five years. (From the 1929 view-point a five-year period gave
ample opportunity to participate in the future success of the business.)
This block of warrants had a real value, and that value in turn was taken
out of the initial value of the common stock.
The price relationships usually obtaining between stock and warrants
suggest that the 1,625,000 warrants would take about one-sixth of the
value away from the common stock. On this basis, one-sixth of the
$100,750,000 cash originally received by the company would be applica-
ble to the warrants, and five-sixths to the stock.
3. By the salaries that the officers were to receive, and also by the extra
taxes incurred through the use of the corporate form.
Summarizing the foregoing analysis, we find that buyers of Petroleum
Corporation shares were paying the following price for the managerial
skill to be applied to the investment of their money:
[634] SECURITY ANALYSIS
1. Cost of financing ($3 per share) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $9,750,000

The three items together may be said to absorb between 25 and 30%
of the amount contributed by the public to the enterprise. By this we
mean not merely a deduction of that percentage of future profits but an
actual sacrifice of invested principal in return for management.
What Was Received for the Price Paid? Carrying the study a step far-
ther, let us ask what kind of managerial skill this enterprise was to enjoy?
The board of directors consisted of many men prominent in finance, and
their judgment on investments was considered well worth having. But
two serious limitations on the value of this judgment must here be noted.
The first is that the directors were not obligated to devote themselves
exclusively or even preponderantly to this enterprise. They were permit-
ted, and seemingly intended, to multiply these activities indefinitely. 
Common sense would suggest that the value of their expert judgment to

Petroleum Corporation would be greatly diminished by the fact that so
many other claims were being made upon it at the same time.
A more obvious limitation appears from the Corporation’s projected
activities. It proposed to devote itself to investments in a single field—
petroleum. The scope for judgment and analysis was thereby greatly cir-
cumscribed. As it turned out, the funds were largely concentrated, first in
two related companies—Prairie Pipe Line Company and Prairie Oil and
Gas Company—and then in a single successor enterprise (Consolidated
Oil Corporation). Thus Petroleum Corporation took on the complexion
of a holding company, in which the exercise of managerial skill appears
to be reduced to a minimum once the original acquisitions are made.
1
We are forced to conclude that financial schemes of the kind illus-
trated by Petroleum Corporation of America are unsatisfactory from the
standpoint of the stock buyer. This is true not only because the total cost
to him for management is excessive in relation to the value of the serv-
ices rendered but also because the cost is not clearly disclosed, being con-
cealed in good measure by the use of the warrant artifice.
2 (The foregoing
reasoning does not rest in any way upon the fact that Petroleum Corpo-
ration’s investments proved unprofitable.

Position of Investment Banking Firms in This Connection.The
second line of inquiry suggested by this example is also of major impor-
tance. What is the position occupied by the investment banking firms
floating an issue such as Petroleum Corporation of America, and how
1 The same logical objection to the payment of a large “managerial bonus, ” in the form of
option warrants to those organizing a holding company, may be urged against the set-up of
Alleghany Corporation and United Corporation.
2 In a series of “Notes” on the history of United Corporation financing by Sanford L.
Schamus, in Columbia Law Review of May, June and November, 1937, the proposal was
advanced that prospectuses issued under S.E.C. legislation should carry a tabulation show-
ing the effect of the exercise of warrants on earnings and asset values. See November 1937
issue, pp. 1173–1174.
3 A review of the operations of Petroleum Corporation, published by the S.E.C. in May 1939,
criticizes severely a number of deals in which the management was interested on the other
side. After 1933 a unique turn was given to the status of Petroleum Corporation through
acquisition of a large interest (39.8%) therein by Consolidated Oil. The two companies thus
became the largest stockholders of each other, an extraordinary and highly objectionable 
situation. See Part 3, Chap. II (2d sec.), of the Report of the S.E.C. on Investment Trusts and
Investment Companies.

does this compare with the practice of former years? Prior to the late
1920’s, the sale of stock to the public by reputable houses of issue was 
governed by the following three important principles:
1. The enterprise must be well established and offer a record and finan-
cial exhibit adequate to justify the purchase of the shares at the issue price.
2. The investment banker must act primarily as the representative of
the buyers of the stock, and he must deal at arm’s-length with the com-
pany’s management. His duty includes protecting his clients against the
payment of excessive compensation to the officers or any other policies
inimical to the stockholders’ interest.
3. The compensation taken by the investment banker must be reason-
able. It represents a fee paid by the corporation for the service of raising
capital.
These rules of conduct afforded a clear line of demarcation between
responsible and disreputable stock financing. It was an established Wall
Street maxim that capital for a new enterprise must be raised from pri-
vate sources.
4 These private interests would be in a position to make their
own investigation, work out their own deal and keep in close touch with
the enterprise, all of which safeguards (in addition to the chance to make
a large profit) were considered necessary to justify a commitment in any
new venture. Hence the public sale of securities in a new enterprise was
confined almost exclusively to “blue sky” promoters and small houses of
questionable standing. The great majority of such flotations were either
downright swindles or closely equivalent thereto by reason of the uncon-
scionable financing charges taken out of the price paid by the public.
Investment-trust financing, by its very nature, was compelled to con-
travene these three established criteria of reputable stock flotations. The
investment trusts were new enterprises; their management and their
bankers were generally identical;the compensation for financing and man-
agement had to be determined solely by the recipients, without accepted
standards of reasonableness to control them. In the absence of such stan-
dards, and in the absence also of the invaluable arm’s-length bargaining
[636] SECURITY ANALYSIS
4 An apparent exception might be made sometimes in a case such as Chile Copper Company
where the demonstrated presence of huge bodies of ore was regarded as justifying public
financing to bring the mine into production. The sale of stock of the Lincoln Motor Company
in 1920 was one of the few real exceptions to the rule as here stated. In this instance an unusu-
ally high personal reputation was behind the enterprise, but it resulted in disastrous failure.

between corporation and banker, it was scarcely to be hoped that the inter-
ests of the security buyer would be adequately protected. Allowance must
be made besides for the generally distorted and egotistical views prevalent
in the financial world during 1928 and 1929.
Developments since 1929. For a time it appeared that the demoraliz-
ing influence of investment-trust financing was likely to spread to the
entire field of common-stock flotations and that even the leading bank-
ing houses were prepared to sell shares of new or virtually new commer-
cial enterprises, without past records and on the basis entirely of their
expected future earnings. (There were definite signs of this tendency in
the beer-and liquor-stock flotations of 1933.) Fortunately, a reversal of
sentiment has since taken place, and we find that the relatively few com-
mon-stock issues sponsored by the first-line houses are now similar in
character and arrangements to those of former days.
5
However, there has been a fair amount of activity in the common-stock
flotation field since 1933, carried on by houses of secondary size or stand-
ing. Most of these issues represent shares of new enterprises, which in turn
tend to fall in whatever industrial group is easiest to exploit at the time.
Thus in 1933 we had many gold-, liquor- and beer-stock flotations, and in
1938–1939 there was a deluge of airplane issues. The formation of new
investment companies, on the other hand, appears to be a perennial indus-
try. In surveying such common-stock flotations, the starting point must
be the realization that the investment banker behind them is not acting
primarily in behalf of his clients who buy the issue. For on the one side the
new corporation is not an independent entity, which can negotiate at
arm’s-length with various bankers representing clients with money to
invest, and on the other side, the banker is himself in part a promoter, in
part a proprietor of the new business. In an important sense, he is raising
funds from the public for himself.
New Role of Such Investment Bankers. More exactly stated, the
investment banker who floats such issues is operating in a double guise.
He makes a deal on his own behalf with the originators of the enterprise,
and then he makes a separate deal with the public to raise from them 
the funds he has promised the business. He demands—and no doubt is
5 See, for example, the offerings of New Idea Company common in 1937, General Shoe
Company common in 1938, Julius Garfinckel and Company in 1939.

entitled to—a liberal reward for his pains. But the very size of his com-
pensation introduces a significant change in his relationship to the pub-
lic. For it makes a very real difference whether a stock buyer can consider
the investment banker as essentially his agent and representative or must
view the issuing house as a promoter-proprietor-manager of a business,
endeavoring to raise funds to carry it on.
When investment banking becomes identified with the latter approach,
the interests of the general public are certain to suffer. The Securities Act
of 1933 aims to safeguard the security buyer by requiring full disclosure
of the pertinent facts and by extending the previously existing liability for
concealment or misrepresentation. Although full disclosure is undoubt-
edly desirable, it may not be of much practical help except to the skilled
and shrewd investor or to the trained analyst. It is to be feared that the typ-
ical stock buyer will neither read the long prospectus carefully nor under-
stand the implications of all it contains. Modern financing methods are
not far different from a magician’s bag of tricks; they can be executed in
full view of the public without its being very much the wiser. The use of
stock options as part of the underwriter-promoter’s compensation is one
of the newer and more deceptive tricks of the trade.
Two examples of new enterprise financing, in 1936 and 1939, will be
discussed in some detail, with the object of illustrating both the character
of these flotations and the technique of analysis required to appraise them.
6
Example A: American Bantam Car Corporation, July 1936.This offer-
ing consisted of 100,000 shares of 6% Cumulative Convertible Preference
stock, sold to the public at $10 per share, its par value. Each share was
convertible into 3 shares of common stock. The “underwriters” received
a gross commission of $2 per share, or 20% of the selling price; however,
this compensation was for selling effort only, without any guarantee to
take or place the shares.
The new company had acquired the plant of the American Austin
Car Company, which had started out in 1929 with $3,692,000 in cash
capital and had ended in bankruptcy. The organizers of the Bantam
[638] SECURITY ANALYSIS
6 In the 1934 edition we analyzed, at this point, the offering of stock in Mouquin, Inc. (liquor
importers) made in September 1933 at $6.75 per share. The facts showed that the public was
asked to place a valuation of $1,670,000 on an enterprise with physical assets of $424,000
and no earnings record. The company passed out of existence in 1937, and the public’s
investment was wiped out.

enterprise bought in the Austin assets, subject to various liabilities, for
only $5,000. They then turned over their purchase, plus $500 in cash, to
the new company for 300,000 shares of its common stock. In other
words, the entire common issue cost the promoters $5,500 cash plus
their time and effort.
The prospectus stated—what was an obvious fact—that the preference
stock was “offered as a speculation. ” That speculation could work out suc-
cessfully only if the conversion privilege proved valuable, since the mere
6% return on a preferred stock was scarcely an adequate reward for the
risk involved. (The character of the risk was shown clearly enough in 
the enormous losses of the predecessor company.) But note that before
the conversion privilege could be worth anything, the common stock
would have to sell for more than $3
1/3 per share—and in that case the
$5,500 investment of the organizers would be worth over $1,000,000. In
other words, before the public could make any profit, the organizers
would have to multiply their stake 180 times.
Sequel. By June 30, 1939, the company had accumulated a deficit of
$750,000; it was compelled to borrow money from the R.F .C., and the pre-
ferred-stock holder no longer had any equity in current assets. The price
of the preference stock declined to 3, but at the same time the common
was quoted at 
3/4 bid. This meant (if the quoted price could be trusted)
that, although the public had lost 70% of its investment, the organizers’
$5,500 contribution had still a nominal market value of $225,000.
Example B: Aeronautical Corporation of America, December 1939.
This company offered to the public 60,000 shares of new common stock
at $6.25 per share. The “underwriters, ” who made no firm commitment
to take any shares, received on the sale of each share the following three
kinds of compensation: (1) 90 cents in cash; (2) 
1/20 of a share of stock,
ostensibly worth 31 cents, donated by the principal stockholders; (3) a
warrant to buy 
1/2 share of stock at prices varying between $6.25 and $8.00
per share. If the common stock was fairly worth the $6.25 offering price,
these warrants were undoubtedly worth at least $1 per share called for.
This would mean an aggregate commission for selling effort of $2.34 per
share, or more than one-third the amount paid over by the public.
The company had been in business since 1928 and had been manu-
facturing its light Aeronca planes since 1931. Its business had grown
steadily from $124,000 sales in 1934 to about $850,000 sales in 1939.

---
**[Page 692]**

However, the enterprise had been definitely unprofitable to the end of
1938, showing an aggregate deficit at that time of over $500,000 (includ-
ing development expense written off). In 9
1/2 months to October 15,
1939, it had earned $50,000. Prior to this offering of new shares to the
public there were outstanding 66,000 shares of stock, which had a net
asset value of only $1.28 per share. In addition to the warrants for 30,000
shares to be given the underwriters, there were like warrants for 15,000
shares in the hands of the officers.
There seemed strong reason to believe that the company occupied a
favorable position in a growing industry. But analysis would show that
the participation of the public in any future increase in earnings was seri-
ously diluted in three different ways: by the cash selling expense sub-
tracted from the price to be paid for the new stock, by the small tangible
assets contributed by the original owners for their stock interest and by
the warrants which would siphon off part of any increased value. To show
the effect of this dilution, let us assume that the company proves so suc-
cessful that its fair value is twice its tangible assets after completion of this
financing—say, about $1,000,000 as compared with $484,000 of tangible
assets. What could then be the value of the stock for which the public paid
$6.25? If there were no warrants outstanding, this value would be about
$8 per share on 126,000 shares. But allowing for a value of say $2.00 per
share for the warrants, the stock itself would be worth only $7.25 per
share. Hence even a very substantial degree of success on the part of this
enterprise would add a mere 16% to the value of the public’s purchase.
Should things go the other way, a very large part of the investment would
soon be dissipated.
Should the Public Finance New Ventures? Fairly complete obser-
vation of new-enterprise financing registered with the S.E.C. since 1933
has given us a pessimistic opinion as to its soundness and its economic
value to the nation. The venturing of capital into new businesses is essen-
tial to American progress, but no substantial contribution to the upbuild-
ing of the country has ever been made by new ventures publicly financed.
Wall Street has always realized that the capital for such undertakings
should properly be supplied on a private and personal basis—by the
organizers themselves or people close to them. Hence the sale of shares
in new businesses has never been a truly reputable pursuit, and the lead-
ing banking houses will not engage in it. The less fastidious channels

through which such financing is done exact so high an over-all selling
cost—to the public —that the chance of success of the new enterprise,
small enough at best, is thereby greatly diminished.
It is our considered view that the nation’s interest would be served by
amending the Securities Act so as to prohibit the public offering of secu-
rities of new and definitely unseasoned ventures. It would not be easy to
define precisely the criteria of “seasoning, ”—e.g., size, number of years’
operation without loss—and it may be necessary to vest some discretion
on this score with the S.E.C. We think, however, that borderline and dif-
ficult cases will be relatively few in number (although our second exam-
ple above belongs, perhaps, in this category). We should be glad to see 
the powers and duties of the S.E.C. diminished in many details of minor
significance; but on this point of protecting a public incapable of protect-
ing itself, our view leans strongly towards more drastic legislation.
Blue-sky Promotions. In the “good old days” fraudulent stock pro-
moters relied so largely upon high pressure salesmanship that they rarely
bothered to give their proposition any semblance of serious merit. They
could sell shares in a mine that was not even a “hole in the ground” or in
an invention the chief recommendation for which was the enormous
profit made by Henry Ford’s early partners. The victim was in fact buy-
ing “blue sky” and nothing else. Any one with the slightest business sense
could have detected the complete worthlessness of these ventures almost
at a glance; in fact, the glossy paper used for the prospectus was in itself
sufficient to identify the proposition as fraudulent.
The tightening of federal and state regulations against these swindles
has led to a different type of security promotion. Instead of offering some-
thing entirely worthless, the promoter selects a real enterprise that he can
sell at much more than its fair value. By this means the law can be obeyed
and the public exploited just the same. Oil and mining ventures lend them-
selves best to such stock flotations, because it is easy to instill in the unini-
tiated an exaggerated notion of their true worth. The S.E.C. has been
concerning itself more and more seriously with endeavors to defeat this
type of semifraud. In theory a promoter may offer something worth $1 per
share at $5, provided he discloses all the facts and adds no false represen-
tations. The Commission is not authorized to pass upon the soundness of
new securities or the fairness of their price (except in the case of public-
utility issues which come under the terms of the Public Utility Holding

Company Act of 1935). Actually, it appears to be doing its best, by various
pressures, to discourage and even prevent the more grossly inequitable
offerings. But it is essential that the public recognize that the Commission’s
powers in this respect are severely limited and that only a sceptical analy-
sis by the intending buyer can assure him against exploitation.
Promotional activities are attracted especially to any new industry that
is in the public eye. Profits made by those first in the field, or even cur-
rently by the enterprise floated, can be given a fictitious guise of perma-
nence and of future enhancement. Hence gross overvaluations can be
made plausible enough to sell. In the liquor flotations of 1933 the degree
of overvaluation depended entirely upon the conscience of the sponsors.
Accordingly, the list of stock offerings showed all gradations from the
thoroughly legitimate down to the almost completely fraudulent.
7 A
somewhat similar picture is presented by the aircraft flotations of
1938–1939. The public would do well to remember that whenever it
becomes easy to raise capital for a particular industry, both the chances
of unfair deals are magnified and the danger of overdevelopment of the
industry itself becomes very real.
Repercussions of Unsound Investment Banking. The relaxation
of investment bankers’ standards in the late 1920’s, and their use of ingen-
ious means to enlarge their compensation, had unwholesome repercus-
sions in the field of corporate management. Operating officials felt
themselves entitled not only to handsome salaries but also to a substan-
tial participation in the profits of the enterprise. In this respect the invest-
ment-trust arrangements, devised by the banking houses for their own
benefit, set a stimulating example to the world of “big business. ”
Whether or not it is proper for executives of a large and prosperous
concern to receive annual compensation running into hundreds of thou-
sands or even millions of dollars is perhaps an open question. Its answer
will depend upon the extent to which the corporation’ s success is due to
their unique or surpassing ability, and this must be very difficult to deter-
mine with assurance. But it may not be denied that devious and question-
able means were frequently employed to secure these large bonuses to the
management without full disclosure of their extent to the stockholders.

Stock-option warrants (or long-term subscription rights) to buy shares
at low prices, proved an excellent instrument for this purpose—as we have
already pointed out in our discussion of stockholder-management rela-
tionships. In this field complete and continued publicity is not only the-
oretically desirable but of practical utility as well. The legislation of
1933–1934 marks an undeniable forward step in this regard, since the
major facts of managerial compensation must now be disclosed in regis-
tration statements and in annual supplements thereto (Form 10-K). With
publicity given to this compensation, we believe that the self-interest of
stockholders may be relied on fairly well to prevent it from passing all
reasonable limits.

SOME ASPECTS OF
CORPORATE PYRAMIDING
PYRAMIDING IN CORPORATE finance is the creation of a speculative capital
structure by means of a holding company or a series of holding compa-
nies. Usually the predominating purpose of such an arrangement is to
enable the organizers to control a large business with the investment of
little or no capital and also to secure to themselves the major part of its
surplus profits and increased going-concern value. The device is most
often utilized by dominant interests to “cash in” speculative profits on
their holdings and at the same time to retain control. With the funds so
provided, these successful captains of finance generally endeavor to
extend their control over additional operating enterprises. The technique
of pyramiding is well illustrated by the successive maneuvers of O. P . and
M. J. Van Sweringen, which started with purchase of control of the then
relatively unimportant New Y ork, Chicago, and St. Louis Railroad and
rapidly developed into a far-flung railroad “empire. ”

Example: The Van Sweringen Pyramid.The original transaction of the
Van Sweringens in the railroad field took place in 1916. It consisted of the

1 The complete story of how this pyramiding was effected is told in the Hearings before the
Committee on Banking and Currency, United States Senate, 73d Congress, 1st Session, on
Senate Resolution 84 of the 72d Congress and Senate Resolution 56 of the 73d Congress,
Part 2, pp. 563–777, June 5 to 8, 1933—on “Stock Exchange Practices. ” The story is also set
forth in greater detail and with graphic portrayal in Regulation of Stock Ownership in Rail-
roads, Part 2, pp. 820–1173 (House Report No. 2789, 71st Congress, 3d Session), especially
the inserts at p. 878 thereof. For graphic and other presentation of the effects of pyramiding
in the public-utility field see Utility Corporations (Sen. Doc. 92, 70th Congress, 1st Session,
pt. 72-A), pp. 154–166.
The most notorious pyramided structure of recent years was the Insull set-up. An inter-
esting example of a different type is presented by the United States and Foreign Securities
Corporation—United States and International Securities Corporation relationship. These two
situations are briefly described in Note 64 at p. 817 of the Appendix on accompanying CD.

purchase from the New Y ork Central Railroad Company, for the sum of
$8,500,000, of common and preferred stock constituting control of the New
Y ork, Chicago, and St. Louis Railroad Company (known as the “Nickel
Plate”). This purchase was financed by giving a note to the seller for
$6,500,000 and by a cash payment of $2,000,000, which in turn was bor-
rowed from a Cleveland bank. Subsequent acquisitions of control of many
other companies were effected by various means, including the following:
1. The formation of a private corporation for the purpose (e.g., West-
ern Corporation to acquire control of Lake Erie and Western Railroad
Company, and Clover Leaf Corporation to acquire control of Toledo, St.
Louis and Western Railroad Company—both in 1922).
2. The use of the resources of one controlled railroad to acquire con-
trol of others (e.g., the New Y ork, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad Com-
pany purchased large amounts of stock of Chesapeake and Ohio Railway
and Pere Marquette Railway Company during 1923–1925).
3. The formation of a holding company to control an individual road,
with sale of the holding company’s securities to the public (e.g., Chesapeake
Corporation, which took over control of Chesapeake and Ohio Railway
Company and sold its own bonds and stock to the public, in 1927).
4. Formation of a general holding company (e.g., Alleghany Corpora-
tion, chartered in 1929. This ambitious project took over control of many
railroad, coal, and miscellaneous enterprises).
The report on the “Van Sweringen Holding Companies” made to the
House of Representatives in 1930
2 includes an interesting chart showing
the contrast between the control exercised by the Van Sweringens and
their relatively small equity or financial interest in the capital of the enter-
prises controlled. On page 646 we append a summary of these data. The
figures in Column A show the percentage of voting securities held or con-
trolled by the Van Sweringens; the figures in Column Bshow the propor-
tion of the “contributed capital” (bonds, stock, and surplus) actually
owned directly or indirectly by them.
It is worth recalling that similar use of the holding company for pyra-
miding control of railroad properties had been made before the war—
notably in the case of the Rock Island Company. This enterprise was
organized in 1902. Through an intermediate subsidiary it acquired nearly

all the common stock of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway
Company and about 60% of the capital stock of the St. Louis and San
Francisco Railway Company. Against these shares the two holding com-
panies issued large amounts of collateral trust bonds, preferred stock and
common stock. In 1909 the stock of the St. Louis and San Francisco was
sold. In 1915 the Rock Island Company and its intermediate subsidiary
both went into bankruptcy; the stock of the operating company was taken
over by the collateral trust bondholders; and the holding company stock
issues were wiped out completely.

Evils of Corporate Pyramiding. The pyramiding device is harmful
to the security-buying public from several standpoints. It results in the
creation and sale to investors of large amounts of unsound senior secu-
rities. It produces common stocks of holding companies which are sub-
ject to deceptively rapid increases in earning power in favorable years and
which are invariably made the vehicle of wild and disastrous public spec-
ulation. The possession of control by those who have no real capital
investment (or a relatively minor one) is inequitable
3 and makes for irre-
sponsible and unsound managerial policies. Finally the holding company
device permits of financial practices that exaggerate the indicated earn-
ings, dividend return, or “book value, ” during boom times, and thus
intensify speculative fervor and facilitate market manipulation. Of these
four objections to corporate pyramiding, the first three are plainly evi-
dent, but the last one requires a certain amount of analytical treatment in
order to present its various implications.
Overstatement of Earnings. Holding companies can overstate their
apparent earning power by valuing at an unduly high price the stock div-
idends they receive from subsidiaries or by including in their income
profits made from the sale of stock of subsidiary companies.
Examples: The chief asset of Central States Electric Corporation was
a large block of North American Company common on which regular
stock dividends were paid. Prior to the end of 1929, these stock dividends
were reported as income by Central States at the market value then cur-
rent. As explained in our chapter on stock dividends, such market prices
averaged far in excess of the value at which North American charged the
stock dividends against its surplus and also far in excess of the distrib-
utable earnings on North American common. Hence the income account
of Central States Electric gave a misleading impression of the earnings
accruing to the company.
A transaction of somewhat different character but of similar effect to the
foregoing was disclosed by the report of American Founders Trust for 1927.
In November 1927 American Founders offered its shareholders the privi-
lege of buying about 88,400 shares of International Securities Corporation
3 See Appendix Note 65, p. 820 on accompanying CD, for examples on this point.

of America Class B Common at $16 per share. International Securities Cor-
poration was a subsidiary of American Founders, and the latter had acquired
the Class B stock of the former at a cash cost of $3.70 per share in 1926.
American Founders reported net earnings for common stock in 1927
amounting to $1,316,488, most of which was created by its own stockhold-
ers through their purchase of shares of the subsidiary as indicated above.

Distortion of Dividend Return. Just as a holding company’s income
may be exaggerated by reason of stock dividends received, so the div-
idend return on its shares may be distorted in the public’s mind by pay-
ment of periodic stock dividends with a market value exceeding
current earnings. People are readily persuaded also to regard the value
of frequent subscription rights as equivalent to an income return on
the common stock. Pyramided enterprises are prodigal with subscrip-
tion rights, for they flow naturally from the succession of new acqui-
sitions and new financing which both promote the ambitions of those
in control and maintain speculative interest at fever heat—until the
inevitable collapse.
The issuance of subscription rights sometimes gives the stock market
an opportunity to indulge in that peculiar circular reasoning which is the
joy of the manipulator and the despair of the analyst. Company A’s stock
is apparently worth no more than 25. Speculation or pool activity has
advanced it to 75. Rights are offered to buy additional shares at 25, and
the rights have a market value of, say, $10 each. To the speculative frater-
nity these rights are practically equivalent to a special dividend of $10. It
is a bonus that not only justifies the rise to 75 but warrants more opti-
mism and a still higher price. To the analyst the whole proceeding is a
delusion and a snare. Whatever value the rights command is manufac-
tured solely out of speculators’ misguided enthusiasm, yet this chimeri-
cal value is accepted as tangible income and as vindication of the
enthusiasm that gave it birth. Thus, with the encouragement of the
manipulator, the speculative public pulls itself up by its bootstraps to
dizzier heights of irrationality.
[648] SECURITY ANALYSIS
4 In the three years 1928–1930 the American Founders group reported total net investment
profits of about $43,300,000; but all of this sum and more was derived from profits on inter-
company transactions of the kind described above. See the S.E.C. ’s Over-all Report on
Investment Trusts, Part III, Chapter VI, Sections II and III, released February 12, 1940.

Additional Aspects of Security Analysis [649]
Example: Between August 1928 and February 1929 American and
Foreign Power Company common stock advanced from 33 to 138 7/8,
although paying no dividend. Rights were offered to the common stock-
holders (and other security holders) to buy second preferred stock with
detached stock-purchase warrants. The offering of these rights, which
had an initial market value of about $3 each, was construed by many as
the equivalent of a dividend on the common stock.
Exaggeration of Book Value. The exaggeration of book value may be
effected in cases where a holding company owns most of the shares of
a subsidiary and where consequently an artificially high quotation may
readily be established for the subsidiary issue by manipulating the small
amount of stock remaining in the market. This high quotation is then
taken as the basis of figuring the book value (sometimes called the
“break-up value”) of the share of the holding company. For an early
example of these practices we may point to Tobacco Products Corpo-
ration (Va.) which owned about 80% of the common stock of United
Cigar Stores Company of America. An unduly high market price seems
to have been established in 1927 for the small amount of Cigar Stores
stock available in the market, and this high price was used to make
Tobacco Products shares appear attractive to the unwary buyer. The
thoroughly objectionable accounting and stock dividend policies of
United Cigar Stores, which we have previously discussed, were adjuncts
to this manipulative campaign.
The most extraordinary example of such exaggeration of the book
value is found, perhaps, in the case of Electric Bond and Share Company
and was founded on its ownership of most of the American and Foreign
Power Company warrants. The whole set-up seems to have been con-
trived to induce the public to pay absolutely fantastic prices without their
complete absurdity being too apparent. A brief review of the various steps
in this phantasmagoria of inflated values should be illuminating to the
student of security analysis.
First, American and Foreign Power Company issued in all 1,600,000
shares of common and warrants to buy 7,100,000 more shares at $25. This
permitted a price to be established for the common stock that generously
capitalized its earnings and prospects but paid no attention to the exis-
tence of the warrants. The quotation of the common was aided by the
issuance of rights, as explained above.

---
**[Page 702]**

Second, the high price registered for the relatively small common-
stock issue automatically created a correspondingly high value for the
millions of warrants.
Third, Electric Bond and Share could apply these high values to its
large holdings of American and Foreign Power common and its enor-
mous block of warrants, thus setting up a correspondingly inflated value
for its own common stock.
Exploitation of the Stock-purchase-warrant Device. The result of this
process, at its farthest point in 1929, was almost incredible. The earnings
available for American and Foreign Power common stock had shown the
following rising trend (due in good part, however, to continuous new
acquisitions):
[650] SECURITY ANALYSIS
Y ear Earnings for common Number of shares Earned per share
1926 $216,000 1,243,988 0.17
1927 856,000 1,244,388 0.69
1928 1,528,000 1,248,930 1.22
1929 6,510,000 1,624,357 4.01
On the theory that a “good public-utility stock is worth up to 50 times
its current earnings, ” a price of 1991/4 per share was recorded for Amer-
ican and Foreign Power common. This produced in turn a price of 174
for the warrants. Hence, by the insane magic of Wall Street, earnings of
$6,500,000 were transmuted into a market value of $320,000,000 for the
common shares and $1,240,000,000 for the warrants, a staggering total
of $1,560,000,000.
Since over 80% of the warrants were owned by Electric Bond and Share
Company, the effect of these absurd prices for American and Foreign
Power junior securities was to establish a correspondingly absurd break-
up value for Electric Bond and Share common. This break-up value was
industriously exploited to justify higher and higher quotations for the lat-
ter issue. In March 1929 attention was called to the fact that the market
value of this company’s portfolio was equivalent to about $108 per share
(of new stock), against a range of 91 to 97 for its own market quotation.
The implication was that Electric Bond and Share stock was “underval-
ued. ” In September 1929 the price had advanced to 184
1/2. It was then
computed that the “break-up value” amounted to about 150, “allowing no

value for the company’s supervisory and construction business. ” The pub-
lic did not stop to reflect that a considerable part of this “book value” was
based upon an essentially fictitious market quotation for an asset that the
company had received for nothingonly a few years before (as a bonus with
American and Foreign Power Second Preferred stock).
This exploitation of the warrants had a peculiar vitality which made
itself felt even in the depth of the depression in 1932–1933. Time having
brought its usual revenge, the once dazzling American and Foreign Power
Company had trembled on the brink of receivership, as shown by a price
of only 15
1/4 for its 5% bonds. Nevertheless, in November 1933 the highly
unsubstantial warrants still commanded an aggregate market quotation
of nearly $50,000,000, a figure that bore a ridiculous relationship to the
exceedingly low values placed upon the senior securities. The following
table shows how absurd this situation was, the more so since it existed in
a time of deflated stock prices, when relative values are presumably sub-
jected to more critical appraisal.

ity had been corrected.
Some Holding Companies Not Guilty of Excessive Pyramiding.
To avoid creating a false impression, we must point out that, although
pyramiding is usually effected by means of holding companies, it does not
follow that all holding companies are created for this purpose and are
therefore reprehensible. The holding company is often utilized for entirely
legitimate purposes, e.g., to permit unified and economical operations of

---
**[Page 704]**

separate units, to diversify investment and risk and to gain certain tech-
nical advantages of flexibility and convenience. Many sound and impor-
tant enterprises are in holding company form.
Examples: United States Steel Corporation is entirely a holding com-
pany; although originally there was some element of pyramiding in its
capital set-up, this defect disappeared in later years. American Telephone
and Telegraph Company is preponderantly a holding company, but its
financial structure has never been subject to serious criticism. General
Motors Corporation is largely a holding company.
A holding-company exhibit must therefore be considered on its mer-
its. American Light and Traction Company is a typical example of the
holding company organized entirely for legitimate purposes. On the other
hand the acquisition of control of this enterprise by United Light and
Railways Company (Del.) must be regarded as a pyramiding move on the
part of the United Light and Power interests.
Speculative Capital Structure May Be Created in Other Ways.
It may be pointed out also that a speculative capital structure can be cre-
ated without the use of a holding company.
Examples:The Maytag Company recapitalization, discussed in an ear-
lier chapter, yielded results usually attained by the formation of a holding
company and the sale of its senior securities. In the case of Continental
Baking Corporation—to cite another example—the holding company form
was not an essential part of the pyramided result there attained. The spec-
ulative structure was due entirely to the creation of large preferred issues
by the parent company, and it would still have existed if Continental Bak-
ing had acquired all its properties directly, eliminating its subsidiaries. (As
it happened, in 1938 this company took steps to acquire the assets of its
chief subsidiaries, thus largely eliminating the holding-company form but
retaining the speculative capital structure.)
Legislative Restraints on Pyramiding. So spectacular were the dis-
astrous effects of the public-utility pyramiding of the 1920’s that Congress
was moved to drastic action. The Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 includes the so-called “death sentence” for many of the existing sys-
tems, requiring them ultimately to simplify their capital structures and
to dispose of subsidiaries operating in noncontiguous territory. Forma-
tion of new pyramids is effectively blocked by requiring Commission

approval for all acquisitions and all new financing. Similar steps are in
prospect to regulate present railroad holding companies and to prevent
creation of new ones.

We may say with some confidence that the spectacle of the Van
Sweringen debacle succeeding the Rock Island Company debacle is not
likely to be duplicated in the future. The industrial field never offered the
same romantic possibilities for high finance as were found among the rails
and utilities, but it may well be that the ingenious talents of promoters
and financial wizards will be directed towards the industrials in the
future. The investor and the analyst should be on their guard against such
new dazzlements.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF COMPANIES
IN THE SAME FIELD
STATISTICAL COMPARISONS of groups of concerns operating in a given
industry are a more or less routine part of the analyst’s work. Such tabu-
lations permit each company’s showing to be studied against a back-
ground of the industry as a whole. They frequently bring to light instances
of undervaluation or overvaluation or lead to the conclusion that the
securities of one enterprise should be replaced by those of another in the
same field.
In this chapter we shall suggest standard forms for such comparative
analyses, and we shall also discuss the significance of the various items
included therein. Needless to say, these forms are called “standard” only
in the sense that they can be used generally to good advantage; no claim
of perfection is made for them, and the student is free to make any
changes that he thinks will serve his particular purpose.

Observations on the Railroad Comparison.1 It has formerly been
the custom to base earnings studies on the figures for the previous calen-
dar years, with certain references to later interim reports. But since com-
plete figures are now available month by month, it is more logical and
effective practice to ignore the calendar-year division and to use instead
the results for the twelve months to the latest date available. The simplest
way to arrive at such a twelve months’ figure is to apply the change shown
for the current year to date to the results of the previous calendar year.
Example:

Our table includes a few significant calculations based on the seven-
year average. In an intensive study, average results should be scrutinized
in more detail. To save time, it is suggested that additional average fig-
ures be computed only for those roads which the analyst selects for fur-
ther investigation after he has studied the exhibits in the “standard form. ”
Whether the period of averaging should cover seven years or a longer or
sho rter time is la r g ely a ma t ter f o r individ ual j udgmen t. I n theo ry i t
should be just long enough to cover a full cyclical fluctuation but not so
long as to include factors or results that are totally out of date. The six
years 1934–1939 might well be regarded as a somewhat better criterion,
for example, than the longer period 1933–1939.
Figures relating to preferred stocks fall into two different classes,
depending on whether the issue is considered for fixed-value investment
or as a speculative commitment. (Usually the market price will indicate

clearly enough in which category a particular issue belongs.) The items
marked “I.P . ” are to be used in studying an investment preferred stock,
and those marked “S.P . ” in studying a speculative preferred. Where there
are junior income bonds, the simplest and most satisfactory procedure
will be to treat them in all respects as a preferred stock issue, with a foot-
note referring to their actual title. Such contingent bond interest will
therefore be excluded from the net deductions or the fixed charges.
In this tabular comparison we follow the suggestion previously offered
that the effective debt be computed by capitalizing the larger of net deduc-
tions or fixed charges. In using the table as an aid to the selection of sen-
ior issues for investment, chief attention will be paid to items 22 and 23 (or
22 “I.P . ” and 23 “I.P . ”), showing the average margin above interest (and pre-
ferred dividend) requirements. Consideration should be given also to items
6, 7 and 8, showing the division of total capitalization between senior secu-
rities and junior equity. (In dealing with bonds, the preferred stock is part
of the junior equity; in considering a preferred stock for investment, it must
be included with the effective debt.) Items 10 and 19 should also be exam-
ined to see if the earnings have been overstated by reason of inadequate
maintenance or by the inclusion of unearned dividends from subsidiaries.
Speculative preferred stocks will ordinarily be analyzed in much the
same way as common stocks, and the similarity becomes greater as the
price of the preferred stock is lower. It should be remembered, however,
that a preferred stock is always less attractive, logically considered, than a
common stock making the same showing. For example, a $6 preferred
earning $5 per share is intrinsically less desirable than a common stock
earning $5 per share (and with the same prior charges), since the latter is
entitled to all the present and future equity, whereas the preferred stock is
strictly limited in its claim upon the future.
In comparing railroad common stocks (and preferred shares equiva-
lent thereto), the point of departure is the percentage earned on the mar-
ket price. This may be qualified, to an extent more or less important, by
consideration of items 10 and 19. Items 12 and 18 will indicate at once
whether the company is speculatively or conservatively capitalized, rela-
tively speaking. A speculatively capitalized road will show a large ratio of
net deductions to gross and (ordinarily) a small ratio of common stock
at market value to gross. The converse will be true for a conservatively
capitalized road.

---
**[Page 710]**

Limitation upon Comparison of Speculatively and Conserva-
tively Capitalized Companies in the Same Field. The analyst
must beware of trying to draw conclusions as to the relative attractive-
ness of two railroad common stocks when one is speculatively and the
other is conservatively capitalized. Two such issues will respond quite dif-
ferently to changes for the better or the worse, so that an advantage pos-
sessed by one of them under current conditions may readily be lost if
conditions should change.
Example: The example shown on p. 681 illustrates in a twofold fash-
ion the fallacy of comparing a conservatively capitalized with a specula-
tively capitalized common stock. In 1922 the earnings of Union Pacific
common were nearly four times  as high in relation to market price as
were those of Rock Island common. A conclusion that Union Pacific was
“cheaper, ” based on these figures, would have been fallacious, because the
relative capitalization structures were so different as to make the two
companies noncomparable. This fact is shown graphically by the much
larger expansion of the earnings and the market price of Rock Island
common that accompanied the moderate rise in gross business during
the five years following.
The situation in 1927 was substantially the opposite. At that time Rock
Island common was earning proportionately more than Union Pacific
common. But it would have been equally fallacious to conclude that Rock
Island common was “intrinsically cheaper. ” The speculative capitalization
structure of the latter road made it highly vulnerable to unfavorable devel-
opment, so that it was unable to withstand the post-1929 depression.
Other Illustrations in Appendix.The practical approach to compar-
ative analysis of railroad stocks (and bonds) may best be illustrated by the
reproduction of several such comparisons made by one of the authors a
number of years ago and published as part of the service rendered to clients
by a New Y ork Stock Exchange firm. These will be found in Appendix Note
66 on accompanying CD. It will be observed that the comparisons were
made between roads in approximately the same class as regards capitaliza-
tion structure, with the exception of the comparison between Atchison and
New Y ork Central, in which instance special reference was made to the
greater sensitivity of New Y ork Central to changes in either direction.

FORM III. INDUSTRIAL COMPARISON (FOR
COMPANIES IN THE SAME FIELD)
Since this form differs in numerous respects from the two preceding, it
is given in full herewith:
A. Capitalization:
1. Bonds at par.
2. Preferred stock at market value 
(number of shares /H11003market price).
3. Common stock at market value 
(number of shares /H11003market price).
4. Total capitalization.
5. Ratio of bonds to capitalization.
6. Ratio of aggregate market value of preferred to capitalization.
7. Ratio of aggregate market value of common to capitalization.
FORM II. PUBLIC-UTILITY COMPARISON
The public-utility comparison form is practically the same as that for rail-
roads. The only changes are the following: Fixed charges (as mentioned
in line 1 and elsewhere) should include subsidiary-preferred dividends.
Line 2 should be called “Funded debt and subsidiary preferred stock, ” and
these should be taken from the balance sheet. Items 22 and 22 I.P ., relat-
ing to net deductions, are not needed. Item 10 becomes “ratio of depre-
ciation to gross. ” An item, 10M, may be included to show “ratio of
maintenance to gross” for the companies which publish this information.
Our observations regarding the use of the railroad comparison apply
as well to the public-utility comparison. Variations in the depreciation
rate are fully as important as variations in the railroad maintenance ratios.
When a wide difference appears, it should not be taken for granted that
one property is unduly conservative or the other not conservative enough,
but a presumption to this effect does arise, and the question should be
investigated as thoroughly as possible. A statistical indication that one
utility stock is more attractive than another should not be acted upon
until (among other qualitative matters) some study has been made of the
rate situation and the relative prospects for favorable or unfavorable
changes therein. In view of experience since 1933, careful attention
should also be given to the dangers of municipal or federal competition.

regarding the use of this suggested form may be helpful. The net earn-
ings figure must be corrected for any known distortions or omissions,
including adjustments for undistributed earnings or losses of subsidiaries.
If it appears to be misleading and cannot be adequately corrected, it
should not be used as a basis of comparisons. (Inferences drawn from
unreliable figures must themselves be unreliable.) No attempt should be

made to subject the depreciation figures to exact comparisons; they are
useful only in disclosing wide and obvious disparities in the rates used.
The calculation of bond-interest-coverage is subject to the qualification
discussed in Chap. 17, with respect to companies that may have impor-
tant rental obligations equivalent to interest charges.
Whereas the percentage earned on the market price of the common
(item 18) is a leading figure in all comparisons, almost equal attention
must be given to item 15, showing the percentage earned on total capi-
talization. These figures, together with items 7 and 19 (ratio of aggregate
market value of common stock to sales and to capitalization), will indi-
cate the part played by conservative or speculative capitalization struc-
tures among the companies compared. (The theory of capitalization
structure was considered in Chap. 40.)
As a matter of practical procedure it is not safe to rely upon the fact
that the earnings ratio for the common stock (item 18) is higher than the
average for the industry, unless the percentage earned on the total capi-
talization (item 15) is also higher. Furthermore, if the company with the
poorer earnings exhibit shows much larger sales-per-dollar-of-common-
stock (item 19), it may have better speculative possibilities in the event of
general business improvement.
The balance-sheet computations do not have primary significance
unless they indicate either definite financial weakness or a substantial
excess of current-asset-value over the market price. The division of
importance as between the current results, the seven-year average and
the trend is something entirely for the analyst’s judgment to decide. Nat-
urally, he will have the more confidence in any suggested conclusion if it
is confirmed on each of these counts.
Example of the Use of Standard Forms. An example of the use of
the standard form to reach a conclusion concerning comparative values
should be of interest. A survey of the common stocks of the listed steel pro-
ducers in July 1938 indicated that Continental Steel had made a better
exhibit than the average, whereas Granite City Steel had shown much
smaller earning power. The two companies operated to some extent in the
same branches of the steel industry; they were very similar in size, and the
price of their common stocks was identical. In the tabulation presented on
page 666 we supply comparative figures for these two enterprises, omitting
some of the items on our standard form as immaterial to this analysis.

---
**[Page 716]**

Comments on the Comparison. The use of five-year average figures
for each item, presented along with those of the most recent twelve
months, is suggested here because the subnormal business conditions
in the year ended June 30, 1938 made it inadvisable to lay too great
emphasis on the results for this single period. Granite City reports on
calendar-year basis, whereas Continental used both a June 30 and a
December 31 fiscal year during 1934–1938. However, the availability of
quarterly or semiannual figures makes it a simple matter for the analyst
to construct his average and 12 months’ figures to end in the middle of
the year.
Analysis of the data reveals only one point of superiority for Granite
City Steel—the smaller amount of senior securities. But even this is not
necessarily an advantage, since the relatively fewer shares of Continental
common make them more sensitive to favorable as well as unfavorable
developments. The exhibit for the June 1938 year, and five-year average,
show a statistical superiority for Continental on each of the following
important points:
Earnings on market price of common stock.
Earnings on total capitalization.
Ratio of gross to market value of common.
Margin of profit.
Depreciation in relation to plant account.
Working-capital position.
Tangible asset values.
Dividend return.
Trend of earnings.
If the comparison is carried back prior to 1934, Granite City is found
to have enjoyed a marked advantage in the depression years from mid-
1930 to mid-1933. During this time it earned and paid dividends while
Continental Steel was reporting moderate losses. It is curious to observe
that in the more recent recession the tables were exactly turned, and Con-
tinental Steel did very well while Granite City fared badly. Obviously the
1937–1938 results would command more attention than those in the
longer past. Nevertheless, the thorough analyst would endeavor to learn
as much as possible about the basic reasons underlying the change in the
relative performance of the two companies.

Study of Qualitative Factors Also Necessary.Our last observation
leads to the more general remark that conclusions suggested by compar-
ative tabulations of this sort should not be accepted until careful thought
has been given to the qualitative factors. When one issue seems to be sell-
ing much too low on the basis of the exhibit in relation to that of another
in the same field, there may be adequate reasons for this disparity that
the statistics do not disclose. Among such valid reasons may be a defi-
nitely poorer outlook or a questionable management. A lower dividend
return for a common stock should not ordinarily be considered as a
strong offsetting factor, since the dividend is usually adjusted to the earn-
ing power within a reasonable time.
Although overconservative dividend policies are sometimes followed
for a considerable period (a subject referred to in Chap. 29), there is a
well-defined tendency even in these cases for the market price to reflect
the earning power sooner or later.
Relative popularity and relative market activity are two elements not
connected with intrinsic value that nevertheless exert a powerful and
often a continuing effect upon the market quotation. The analyst must
give these factors respectful heed, but his work would be stultified if he
always favored the more active and the more popular issue.
The recommendation of an exchange of one security for another seems
to involve a greater personal accountability on the part of the analyst than
the selection of an issue for original purchase. The reason is that holders
of securities for investment are loath to make changes, and thus they are
particularly irritated if the subsequent market action makes the move
appear to have been unwise. Speculative holders will naturally gage all
advice by the test of market results—usually immediate results. Bearing
these human-nature factors in mind, the analyst must avoid suggesting
common-stock exchanges to speculators (except possibly if accompanied
by an emphatic disclaimer of responsibility for subsequent market action),
and he must hesitate to suggest such exchanges to holders for investment
unless the statistical superiority of the issue recommended is quite impres-
sive. As an arbitrary rule, we might say that there should be good reason
to believe that by making the exchange the investor would be getting at
least 50% more for his money.

the nature of the industry considered. The basic question, of course, is
whether future developments are likely to affect all the companies in the
group similarly or dissimilarly. If similarly, then substantial weight may
be accorded to the relative performance in the past, as shown by the sta-
tistical exhibit. An industrial group of this type may be called “homoge-
neous. ” But, if the individual companies in the field are likely to respond
quite variously to new conditions, then the relative showing must be
regarded as a much less reliable guide. A group of this kind may be
termed “heterogeneous. ”
With certain exceptions for traffic and geographical variations, e.g., in
particular, the Pocohantas soft-coal carriers, the railroads must be consid-
ered a highly homogeneous group. The same is true of the larger light, heat
and power utilities. In the industrial field the best examples of homogeneous
groups are afforded by the producers of raw materials and of other standard-
ized products in which the trade name is a minor factor. These would
include producers of sugar, coal, metals, steel products, cement, cotton print
cloths, etc. The larger oil companies may be considered as fairly homoge-
neous; the smaller concerns are not well suited to comparison because they
are subject to sudden important changes in production, reserves and rela-
tive price received. The larger baking, dairy and packing companies fall into
fairly homogeneous groups. The same is true of the larger chain-store enter-
prises when compared with other units in the same subgroups, e.g., grocery,
five-and-ten-cent, restaurant, etc. Department stores are less homogeneous,
but comparisons in this field are by no means far-fetched.
Makers of manufactured goods sold under advertised trade-marks
must generally be regarded as belonging to heterogeneous groups. In
these fields one concern frequently prospers at the expense of its com-
petitors, so that the units in the industry do not improve or decline
together. Among automobile manufactures, for example, there have been
continuous and pronounced variations in relative standing. Producers of
all the various classes of machinery and equipment are subject to some-
what the same conditions. This is true also of the proprietary drug man-
ufacturers. Intermediate positions from this point of view are occupied
by such groups as the larger makers of tires, of tobacco products, of shoes,
wherein changes of relative position are not so frequent.

Philip Morris, relative to its large competitors, the somewhat less spectacular development of

The analyst must be most cautious about drawing comparative con-
clusions from the statistical data when dealing with companies in a het-
erogeneous group. No doubt preference may properly be accorded in
these fields to the companies making the best quantitative showing (if not
offset by known qualitative factors)—for this basis of selection would
seem sounder than any other—but the analyst and the investor should be
fully aware that such superiority may prove evanescent. As a general rule,
the less homogeneous the group the more attention must be paid to the
qualitative factors in making comparisons.
More General Limitations on the Value of Comparative Analy-
sis. It may be well once again to caution the student against being
deluded by the mathematical exactitude of his comparative tables into
believing that their indicated conclusions are equally exact. We have men-
tioned the need of considering qualitative factors and of allowing for lack
of homogeneity. But beyond these points lie all the various obstacles to
the success of the analyst that we presented in some detail in our first
chapter. The technique of comparative analysis may lessen some of the
hazards of his work, but it can never exempt him from the vicissitudes of
the future or the stubborness of the stock market itself or the conse-
quences of his own failure—often unavoidable—to learn all the impor-
tant facts. He must expect to appear wrong often and to be wrong on
occasion; but with intelligence and prudence his work should yield bet-
ter over-all results than the guesses or the superficial judgments of the
typical stock buyer.

Chapter 50
DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN
PRICE AND VALUE
OUR EXPOSITION OF THE TECHNIQUE of security analysis has included many
different examples of overvaluation and undervaluation. Evidently the
processes by which the securities market arrives at its appraisals are fre-
quently illogical and erroneous. These processes, as we pointed out in
our first chapter, are not automatic or mechanical but psychological, for
they go on in the minds of people who buy or sell. The mistakes of the
market are thus the mistakes of groups or masses of individuals. Most of
them can be traced to one or more of three basic causes: exaggeration,
oversimplification or neglect.
In this chapter and the next we shall attempt a concise review of the
various aberrations of the securities market. We shall approach the sub-
ject from the standpoint of the practical activities of the analyst, seeking
in each case to determine the extent to which it offers an opportunity for
profitable action on his part. This inquiry will thus constitute an ampli-
fication of our early chapter on the scope and limitations of security
analysis, drawing upon the material developed in the succeeding discus-
sions, to which a number of references will be made.
General Procedure of the Analyst. Since we have emphasized that
analysis will lead to a positive conclusion only in the exceptional case, it
follows that many securities must be examined before one is found that
has real possibilities for the analyst. By what practical means does he pro-
ceed to make his discoveries? Mainly by hard and systematic work. There
are two broad methods that he may follow. The first consists of a series of
comparative analyses by industrial groups along the lines described in the
previous chapter. Such studies will give him a fair idea of the standard or
usual characteristics of each group and also point out those companies
which deviate widely from the modal exhibit. If, for example, he discovers

that a certain steel common stock has been earning about twice as much
on its market price as the industry as a whole, he has a clue to work on—
or rather a suggestion to be pursued by dint of a thoroughgoing investiga-
tion of all the important qualitative and quantitative factors relating to the
enterprise.
The same type of methodical inquiry may be applied to the field of
bonds and preferred stocks. The wide area of receivership railroad bonds
can best be explored by means of a comparative analysis of the showing
of the bonds of roughly the same rank issued by, say, a dozen of the major
carriers in trusteeship. Or a large number of public-utility preferred
stocks could be listed according to: (1) their over-all dividend and inter-
est coverage, (2) their stock-value ratio and (3) their price and yield. Such
a simple grouping might indicate a few issues that either were well
secured and returned more than the average or else were clearly selling
too high in view of their inadequate statistical protection. And so on.
The second general method consists in scrutinizing corporate reports
as they make their appearance and relating their showing to the market
price of their bonds or stocks. These reports can be seen—in summary
form, at least—in various daily papers; a more comprehensive presenta-
tion can be found in the daily corporation-report sheets of the financial
services or weekly in the Commercial and Financial Chronicle. A quick
glance at a hundred of such reports may reveal between five and ten that
look interesting enough from the earnings or current-asset standpoint to
warrant more intensive study.
Can Cyclical Swings of Prices Be Exploited? The best understood
disparities between price and value are those which accompany the recur-
rent broad swings of the market through boom and depression. It is a mere
truism that stocks sell too high in a bull market and too low in a bear mar-
ket. For at bottom this is simply equivalent to saying that any upward or
downward movement of prices must finally reach a limit, and since prices
do not remain at such limits (or at any other level) permanently, it must
turn out in retrospect that prices will have advanced or declined too far.
Can the analyst exploit successfully the repeated exaggerations of 
the general market? Experience suggests that a procedure somewhat like
the following should turn out to be reasonably satisfactory:
1. Select a diversified list of leading common stocks, e.g., those in the
“Dow-Jones Industrial Average. ”
[670] SECURITY ANALYSIS

**[Page 723]**

Additional Aspects of Security Analysis [671]
2. Determine an indicated “normal” value for this group by applying
a suitable multiplier to average earnings. The multiplier might be equiv-
alent to capitalizing the earnings at, say, twice the current interest rate on
highest grade industrial bonds. The period for averaging earnings would
ordinarily be seven to ten years, but exceptional conditions such as
occurred in 1931–1933 might suggest a different method, e.g., basing the
average on the period beginning in 1934, when operating in 1939 or later.
3. Make composite purchases of the list when the shares can be
bought at a substantial discount from normal value, say, at 
2/3 such value.
Or purchases may be made on a scale downwards, beginning say, at 80%
of normal value.
4. Sell out such purchases when a price is reached substantially above
normal value, say, 
1/3 higher, or from 20% to 50% higher on a scale basis.
This was the general scheme of operations developed by Roger Babson
many years ago. It yielded quite satisfactory results prior to 1925. But—as
we pointed out in Chap. 37—during the 1921–1933 cycle (measuring from
low point to low point) it would have called for purchasing during 1921, 
selling out probably in 1926, thus requiring complete abstinence from the
market during the great boom of 1927–1929, and repurchasing in 1931, to
be followed by a severe shrinkage in market values. A program of this 
character would have made far too heavy demands upon human fortitude.
The behavior of the market since 1933 has offered difficulties of a dif-
ferent sort in applying these mechanical formulas—particularly in deter-
mining normal earnings from which to compute normal values. It is
scarcely to be expected that an idea as basically simple as this one can be
utilized with any high degree of accuracy in catching the broad market
swings. But for those who realize its inherent limitations it may have con-
siderable utility, for at least it is likely on the average to result in purchases
at intrinsically attractive levels—which is more than half the battle in
common-stock investment.
“Catching the Swings” on a Marginal Basis Impracticable.
From the ordinary speculative standpoint, involving purchases on mar-
gin and short sales, this method of operation must be set down as imprac-
ticable. The outright owner can afford to buy too soon and to sell too
soon. In fact he must expect to do both and to see the market decline far-
ther after he buys and advance farther after he sells out. But the margin
trader is necessarily concerned with immediate results; he swims with the

---
**[Page 724]**

tide, hoping to gage the exact moment when the tide will turn and to
reverse his stroke the moment before. In this he rarely succeeds, so that
his typical experience is temporary success ending in complete disaster.
It is the essential character of the speculator that he buys because he
thinks stocks are going up not because they are cheap, and conversely
when he sells. Hence there is a fundamental cleavage of viewpoint
between the speculator and the securities analyst, which militates strongly
against any enduringly satisfactory association between them.
Bond prices tend undoubtedly to swing through cycles in somewhat
the same way as stocks, and it is frequently suggested that bond investors
follow the policy of selling their holdings near the top of these cycles and
repurchasing them near the bottom. We are doubtful if this can be done
with satisfactory results in the typical case. There are no well-defined
standards as to when high-grade bond prices are cheap or dear corre-
sponding to the earnings-ratio test for common stocks, and the opera-
tions have to be guided chiefly by a technique of gaging market moves
that seems rather far removed from “investment. ” The loss of interest on
funds between the time of sale and repurchase is a strong debit factor, and
in our opinion the net advantage is not sufficient to warrant incurring
the psychological dangers that inhere in any placing of emphasis by the
investor upon market movements.
Opportunities in “Secondary” or Little-known Issues. Return-
ing to common stocks, although overvaluation or undervaluation of lead-
ing issues occurs only at certain points in the stock-market cycle, the 
large field of “nonrepresentative” or “secondary” issues is likely to yield
instances of undervaluation at all times. When the market leaders are
cheap, some of the less prominent common stocks are likely to be a good
deal cheaper. During 1932–1933, for example, stocks such as Plymouth
Cordage, Pepperell Manufacturing, American Laundry Machinery and
many others, sold at unbelievably low prices in relation to their past
records and current financial exhibits. It is probably a matter for individ-
ual preference whether the investor should purchase an outstanding issue
like General Motors at about 50% of its conservative valuation or a less
prominent stock like Pepperell at about 25% of such value.
The Impermanence of Leadership. The composition of the market-
leader group has varied greatly from year to year, especially in view of the
recent shift of attention from past performance to assumed prospects. If

we examine the list during the decline of 1937–1938, we shall find quite
a number of once outstanding issues that sold at surprisingly low prices
in relation to their statistical exhibits.
Example: A startling example of this sort is provided by Great Atlantic

The balance sheet of January 31, 1938, showed cash assets of 85 mil-
lions and net current assets of 134 millions. At the 1938 low prices, the
preferred and common together were selling for 126 millions. Here, then,
was a company whose spectacular growth was one of the great romances
of American business, a company that was without doubt the largest retail
enterprise in America and perhaps in the world, that had an uninter-
rupted record of earnings and dividends for many years—and yet was
selling for less than its net current assets alone. Thus one of the outstand-
ing businesses of the country was considered by Wall Street in 1938 to be
worth less as a going concern than if it were liquidated. Why? First,
because of chain-store tax threats; second, because of a recent decline in
earnings; and, third, because the general market was depressed.
We doubt that a better illustration can be found of the real nature of
the stock market, which does not aim to evaluate businesses with any
exactitude but rather to express its likes and dislikes, its hopes and fears,

in the form of daily changing quotations. There is indeed enough sound
sense and selective judgment in the market’s activities to create on most
occasions some degree of correspondence between market price and
ascertainable or intrinsic value. In particular, as was pointed out in Chap.
4, when we are dealing with something as elusive and nonmathematical
as the evaluation of future prospects, we are generally led to accept the
market’s verdict as better than anything that the analyst can arrive at. But,
on enough occasions to keep the analyst busy, the emotions of the stock
market carry it in either direction beyond the limits of sound judgment.
Opportunities in Normal Markets. During the intermediate period,
when average prices show no definite signs of being either too low or too
high, common stocks may usually be found that seem definitely under-
valued on a statistical basis. These generally fall into two classes: (1) Those
showing high current and average earnings in relation to market price
and (2) those making a reasonably satisfactory exhibit of earnings and
selling at a low price in relation to net-current-asset value. Obviously,
such companies will not be large and well known, or else the trend of

It is not difficult for the assiduous analyst to find interesting statisti-
cal exhibits such as those presented in our table. Much more difficult is
the task of determining whether or not the qualitative factors will justify
following the quantitative indications—in other words, whether or not
the investor may have sufficient confidence in the company’s future to
consider its shares a real bargain at the apparently subnormal price.
On this question the weight of financial opinion appears inclined to a
generally pessimistic conclusion. The investment trusts, with all their facil-
ities for discovering opportunities of this type, have paid little attention to
them—partly, it is true, because they are difficult to buy and sell in the
large quantities that the trusts prefer, but also because of their conviction
that however good the statistical exhibit of a secondary company may be

---
**[Page 728]**

it is not likely to prove a profitable purchase unless there is specific ground
for optimism regarding its future.
The main drawback of a typical smaller sized company is its vulnera-
bility to a sudden and perhaps permanent loss of its earning power.
Undoubtedly such adverse developments occur in a larger proportion of
cases in this group than among the larger enterprises. As an offset to this
we have the fact that the successful small company can multiply its value
far more impressively than those which are already of enormous size. For
example, the growth of Philip Morris, Inc., in market value from 5 millions
in 1934 to 90 millions in 1939, accompanying a 1,200% increase in net earn-
ings, would have been quite inconceivable in the case of American Tobacco.
Similarly, the growth of Pepsi-Cola has far outstripped in percentage that
of Coca-Cola; the same is true of General Shoe vs. International Shoe; etc.
But most students will try to locate the potential Philip Morris oppor-
tunities, by gaging future possibilities with greater or less care, and will
then buy their shares even at a fairly high price—rather than make their
commitments in a diversified group of “bargain issues” with only ordi-
nary prospects. Our own experience leads us to favor the latter technique,
although we cannot guarantee brilliant results therefrom under present-
day conditions. Y et judging from observations made over a number of
years, it would seem that investment in apparently undervalued common
stocks can be carried on with a very fair degree of over-all success, pro-
vided average alertness and good judgment are used in passing on the
future-prospect question—and provided also that commitments are
avoided at times when the general market is statistically much too high.
Two older examples of this type of opportunity are given here, to afford
the reader some notion of former stock markets.

In these cases the market price had failed to reflect adequately the
indicated earning power.
Market Behavior of Standard and Nonstandard Issues. A close
study of the market action of common stocks suggests the following fur-
ther general observations:
1. Standard or leading issues almost always respond rapidly to
changes in their reported profits—so much so that they tend regularly
to exaggerate marketwise the significance of year-to-year fluctuations in
earnings.
2. The action of the less familiar issues depends largely upon what atti-
tude is taken towards them by professional market operators. If interest
is lacking, the price may lag far behind the statistical showing. If interest
is attracted to the issue, either manipulatively or more legitimately, the
opposite result can readily be attained, and the price will respond in
extreme fashion to changes in the company’s exhibit.
Examples of Behavior of Nonstandard Issues. The following two
examples will illustrate this diversity of behavior of nonrepresentative
common stocks.

These were extraordinarily large earnings and dividends. Even allow-
ing for the fact that they were due to wartime prices for zinc, the market
price showed none the less a striking disregard of the company’s spectac-
ular exhibit. The reason was lack of general interest or of individual 
market sponsorship.

Contrast the foregoing with the appended showing of the common
stock of Mullins Body (later Mullins Manufacturing) Corporation.
Between 1924 and 1926 we note the characteristic market swings of a
low-priced “secondary” common-stock issue. At the beginning of 1927
the shares were undoubtedly attractive, speculatively, at about 10, for the
price was low in relation to the earnings of the three years previously. A
substantial, but by no means spectacular, rise in profits during 1927–1928
resulted in a typical stock-market exploitation. The price advanced from
10 in 1927 to 95 in 1928 and fell back again to 10 in 1929.

A contrast of another kind is afforded by the behavior of the aircraft-
manufacturing stocks in 1938–1939, as compared with that of war ben-
eficiaries in 1915–1918. The two following examples will illustrate the
relationship between market price in 1938 and 1939 and actual perform-
ance at the time.

earnings. The contrast between the Butte and Superior price-earnings
ratio in 1915–1916 and that of these aircraft concerns in 1938–1939 is
very striking.
Relationship of the Analyst to Such Situations. The analyst can deal
intelligently and fairly successfully with situations such as Wright Aero-
nautical, Bangor and Aroostook, Firestone and Butte and Superior at the
periods referred to. He could even have formed a worth-while opinion
about Mullins early in 1927. But once this issue fell into market opera-
tors’ hands it passed beyond the pale of analytical judgment. As far as
Wall Street was concerned, Mullins had ceased to be a business and had
become a symbol on the ticker tape. To buy it or to sell it was equally haz-
ardous; the analyst could warn of the hazard, but he could have no idea
of the limits of its rise or fall. (As it happened, however, the company
issued a convertible preferred stock in 1928 which made possible a prof-
itable hedging operation, consisting of the purchase of the preferred and
the sale of the common.) Similarly with the airplane issues in 1939, the
analyst could go no further than to indicate the obvious hazard that lay
in treating as permanent a source of business that the whole world must
necessarily hope was essentially temporary.
When the general market appears dangerously high to the analyst,
he must be hesitant about recommending unfamiliar common stocks,
even though they may seem to be of the bargain type. A severe decline
in the general market will affect all stock prices adversely, and the less
active issues may prove especially vulnerable to the effects of necessi-
tous selling.
Market Exaggerations Due to Factors Other than Changes in
Earnings: Dividend Changes. The inveterate tendency of the stock mar-
ket to exaggerate extends to factors other than changes in earnings.
Overemphasis is laid upon such matters as dividend changes, stock split-
ups, mergers and segregations. An increase in the cash dividend is a favor-
able development, but it is absurd to add $20 to the price of a stock just
because the dividend rate is advanced from $5 to $6 annually. The buyer
at the higher price is paying out in advance all the additional dividends
that he will receive at the new rate over the next 20 years. The excited
responses often made to stock dividends are even more illogical, since
they are in essence nothing more than pieces of paper. The same is true
of split-ups, which create more shares but give the stockholder nothing

---
**[Page 732]**

he did not have before—except the minor advantage of a possibly broader
market due to the lower price level.1
Mergers and Segregations.Wall Street becomes easily enthusiastic over
mergers and just as ebullient over segregations, which are the exact oppo-
site. Putting two and two together frequently produces five in the stock
market, and this five may later be split up into three and three. Such
inductive studies as have been made of the results following mergers seem
to cast considerable doubt upon the efficacy of consolidation as an aid to
earning power.
2 There is also reason to believe that the personal element
in corporate management often stands in the way of really advantageous
consolidations and that those which are consummated are due sometimes
to knowledge by those in control of unfavorable conditions ahead.
The exaggerated response made by the stock market to developments
that seem relatively unimportant in themselves is readily explained in
terms of the psychology of the speculator. He wants “action, ” first of all;
and he is willing to contribute to this action if he can be given any pre-
text for bullish excitement. (Whether through hypocrisy or self-decep-
tion, brokerage-house customers generally refuse to admit they are
merely gambling with ticker quotations and insist upon some ostensible
“reason” for their purchases.) Stock dividends and other “favorable devel-
opments” of this character supply the desired pretexts, and they have been
exploited by the professional market operators, sometimes with the con-
nivance of the corporate officials. The whole thing would be childish if it
were not so vicious. The securities analyst should understand how these
absurdities of Wall Street come into being, but he would do well to avoid
any form of contact with them.
[680] SECURITY ANALYSIS
1 In the Atlas Tack manipulation of 1933 an effort was made to attract public buying by
promising a split-up of the stock, 3 shares for 1. Obviously, such a move could make no real
difference of any kind in the case of an issue selling in the 30s. The circumstances surround-
ing the rise of Atlas Tack from 1
1/2 to 343/4 in 1933 and its precipitous fall to 10 are worth
studying as a perfect example of the manipulative pattern. It is illuminating to compare the
price-earnings and the price-assets relationships of the same stock prior to 1929.
2 See, for example, Arthur S. Dewing, “ A Statistical Test of the Success of Consolidations, ”
published in Quarterly Journal of Economics, November 1921 and reprinted in his Financial
Policy of Corporations, pp. 885–898, New Y ork, 1926. But see Henry R. Seager and Charles
A. Gullick, Trust and Corporation Problems, pp. 659–661, New Y ork, 1929, and Report of the
Committee on Recent Economic Changes, Vol. I, pp. 194 ff., New Y ork, 1929.

Litigation. The tendency of Wall Street to go to extremes is illustrated
in the opposite direction by its tremendous dislike of litigation. A lawsuit
of any significance casts a damper on the securities affected, and the
extent of the decline may be out of all proportion to the merits of the case.
Developments of this kind may offer real opportunities to the analyst,
though of course they are of a specialized nature. The aspect of broadest
importance is that of receivership. Since the undervaluations resulting
therefrom are almost always confined to bond issues, we shall discuss this
subject later in the chapter in connection with senior securities.
Example: A rather striking example of the effect of litigation on com-
mon-stock values is afforded by the Reading Company case. In 1913 the
United States government brought suit to compel separation of the com-
pany’s railroad and coal properties. The stock market, having its own ideas
of consistency, considered this move as a dangerous attack on Reading,
despite the fact that the segregation would in itself ordinarily be considered
as “bullish. ” A plan was later agreed upon (in 1921) under which the coal
subsidiary’s stock was in effect to be distributed pro rata among the Read-
ing Company’s common and preferred shareholders. This was hailed in
turn as a favorable development, although in fact it constituted a victory
for the government against the company.
Some common stockholders, however, objected to the participation of
the preferred stock in the coal company “rights. ” Suit was brought to restrict
these rights to the common stock. Amusingly, but not surprisingly, the
effect of this move was to depress the price of Reading common. In logic,
the common should have advanced, since, if the suit were successful, there
would be more value for the junior shares, and, if it failed (as it did), there
would be no less value than before. But the stock market reasoned merely
that here was some new litigation and hence Reading common should be
“let alone. ”
Situations involving litigation frequently permit the analyst to pursue
to advantage his quantitative approach in contrast with the qualitative
attitude of security holders in general. Assume that the assets of a bank-
rupt concern have been turned into cash and there is available for distri-
bution to its bondholders the sum of, say, 50% net. But there is a suit
pending, brought by others, to collect a good part of this money. It may
be that the action is so far-fetched as to be almost absurd; it may be that
it has been defeated in the lower courts, and even on appeal, and that it

---
**[Page 734]**

has now but a microscopic chance to be heard by the United States
Supreme Court. Nevertheless, the mere pendency of this litigation will
severely reduce the market value of the bonds. Under the conditions
named, they are likely to sell as low as 35 instead of 50 cents on the dol-
lar. The anomaly here is that a remote claim, which the plaintiff can
regard as having scarcely any real value to him, is made the equivalent in
the market to a heavy liability on the part of the defendant. We thus have
a mathematically demonstrable case of undervaluations, and, taking these
as a class, they lend themselves exceedingly well to exploitation by the
securities analyst.
Examples:Island Oil and Transport 8% Notes. In June 1933 these notes
were selling at 18. The receiver held a cash fund equivalent to about 45%
on the issue, from which were deductible certain fees and allowances, indi-
cating a net distributable balance of about 30 for the notes. The distribu-
tion was being delayed by a suit for damages that had been repeatedly
unsuccessful in its various legal stages and was now approaching final deter-
mination. This suit was exerting an adverse effect upon the market value
of the notes out of all proportion to its merits, a statement that is demon-
strable from the fact that the litigation could have been settled by payment
of a relatively small amount. After the earlier decisions were finally sus-
tained by the higher courts, the noteholders received a distribution of $290
per $1,000 in April 1934. A small additional distribution was indicated.
3
A similar situation arose in the case of United Shipyards Corporation
stock after ratification of the sale of its properties to Bethlehem Steel Com-
pany in 1938. Dissenting holders brought suit to set the sale aside on the
ground that the price was grossly inadequate. The effect of this litigation
was to hold down the price of the Class Bcommon to 1
1/4 in January 1939,
as against a realizable value of between 2 1/2 to 3 if the sale was upheld.
Obviously, if the suit had any merit, the stock should have been worth
more rather than less than 2
1/2; alternatively, if it had no merit, as seemed
[682] SECURITY ANALYSIS
3 A very similar situation existed in 1938 in connection with the various bond issues of
National Bondholders Corporation, which was engaged in liquidating various properties
and claims. These securities were selling at considerably less than the amount realizable for
them in liquidation, chiefly because of certain suits involving a substantial cash fund. As in
the Island Oil example, this litigation was in the last stages of appeal, and the decisions
theretofore had all been favorable to the bondholders. Following the final decision the value
of a typical issue advanced from 26 bid in 1938 to the equivalent of 41 bid in 1939.

Additional Aspects of Security Analysis [683]
clear, then the shares were clearly worth twice their selling price. (A sim-
ilar disparity existed in connection with the price of the Class A stock.)
Undervalued Investment Issues. Undervalued bonds and preferred
stocks of investment caliber may be discovered in any period by means
of assiduous search. In many cases the low price of a bond or preferred
stock is due to a poor market, which in turn results from the small size
of the issue, but this very small size may make for greater inherent secu-
rity. The Electric Refrigeration Building Corporation 6s, due 1936,
described in Chap. 26, are a good example of this paradox.
At times some specific development greatly strengthens the position
of a senior issue, but the price is slow to reflect this improvement, and
thus a bargain situation is created. These developments relate usually to
the capitalization structure or to corporate relationships. Several exam-
ples will illustrate our point.
Examples: In 1923 Y oungstown Sheet and Tube Company purchased
the properties of Steel and Tube Company of America and assumed lia-
bility for the latter’s General Mortgage 7s, due 1951. Y oungstown sold a
6% debenture issue at 99 to supply funds for this purchase. The follow-
ing price relationship obtained at the time:
Company Price Yield, %
Y oungstown Sheet and Tube Debenture 6s 99 6.02
Steel and Tube General 7s 102 6.85
The market failed to realize the altered status of the Steel and Tube
bonds, and thus they sold illogically at a higher yield than the unsecured
issue of the same obligor company. This presented a clear-cut opportu-
nity to the analyst to recommend a purchase or an exchange.
In 1922 the City of Detroit purchased the urban lines of Detroit
United Railway Company and agreed to pay therefor sums sufficient to
retire the Detroit United Railway First 4
1/2s, due 1932. Unusually strong
protective provisions were inserted in the purchase contract which prac-
tically, if not technically, made the City of Detroit liable for the bonds.
But, after the deal was consummated, the bonds sold at 82, yielding more
than 7%. The bond market failed to recognize their true status as virtual
obligations of the City of Detroit.

**[Page 736]**

In 1924 Congoleum Company had outstanding $1,800,000 of 7% pre-
ferred stock junior to $2,890,000 of bonds and followed by 960,000 shares
of common stock having an average market value of some $48,000,000.
In October of that year the company issued 681,000 additional shares of
common for the business of the Nairn Linoleum Company, a large unit
in the same field, with $15,000,000 of tangible assets. The enormous
equity thus created for the small senior issues made them safe beyond
question, but the price of the preferred stock remained under par.
In 1927 Electric Refrigeration Corporation (now Kelvinator Corpo-
ration) sold 373,000 shares of common stock for $6,600,000, making a
total of 1,000,000 shares of common stock, with average market value of
about $21,000,000, coming behind only $2,880,000 of 6% notes, due in
1936. The notes sold at 74, however, to yield 11%. The low price was due
to a large operating deficit incurred in 1927, but the market failed to take
into account the fact that the receipt of a much greater amount of new
cash from the sale of additional stock had established a very strong back-
ing for the small note issue.
These four senior issues have all been paid off at par or higher. (The
Congoleum-Nairn Preferred was called for payment at 107 in 1934.)
Examples of this kind are convenient for the authors since they do not
involve the risk of some later mischance casting doubt upon their judg-
ment. To avoid loading the dice too heavily in our favor, we add another
illustration which is current as this chapter is written.
A Current Example. Choctaw and Memphis Railroad Company First
5s, due 1949, were selling in 1939 at about 35, carrying more than 5 years’
unpaid interest. They were a first lien on underlying mileage of the
Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific System. The Rock Island had been
reporting poor earnings since 1930, and all its obligations were in default.
However, a segregation of the 1937 earnings by mortgage divisions
showed that the Choctaw and Memphis mileage was very profitable and
that its interest charges had been covered 2.6 times in that year even
though the company had earned only $2,700,000 toward total interest of
$14,080,000. Furthermore, the several reorganization plans presented up
to 1939, including that of the I.C.C. examiner, had all provided for prin-
cipal and back interest on this issue in full, although virtually the entire
remaining bond structure was to be drastically cut down, and total inter-
est charges were to be reduced to less than $2,500,000 annually.
[684] SECURITY ANALYSIS

**[Page 737]**

Additional Aspects of Security Analysis [685]
Assuming, as seemed inevitable, that the company was to be reorgan-
ized along the lines proposed, it was clear that these Choctaw and Mem-
phis bonds would enjoy a very strong position, whether they were to be
left undisturbed with their lien on a valuable mileage and their back inter-
est paid off, or were to be given par for par in a new, small first mortgage
on the entire system. This conclusion would be inescapable unless it were
true that a railroad with minimum gross earnings of 65 millions could
not be counted on to meet charges of 2
1/2 millions annually—less than
one-fifth its former burden.
Thus all the quantitative factors would seem to indicate strongly that
the Choctaw and Memphis 5s were greatly undervalued at 35 and that
once the recapitalization was completed the entrenched position of this
issue should become manifest.
4
Price-value Discrepancies in Receiverships. In Chap. 18, deal-
ing with reorganization procedure, we gave two diverse examples of 
disparities arising under a receivership: the Fisk Rubber case, in which
the obligations sold at a ridiculously low price compared with the cur-
rent assets available for them; and the Studebaker case, in which the
price of the 6% notes was clearly out of line with that of the stock. A
general statement may fairly be made that in cases where substantial
values are ultimately realized out of a receivership, the senior securities
will be found to have sold at much too low a price. This characteristic
has a twofold consequence. It has previously led us to advise strongly
against buying at investment levels any securities of a company that 
is likely to fall into financial difficulties; it now leads us to suggest 
that after these difficulties have arisen they may produce attractive 
analytical opportunities.
This will be true not only of issues so strongly entrenched as to come
through reorganization unscathed (e.g., Brooklyn Union Elevated 5s, as
described in Chap. 2) but also of senior securities which are “scaled down”
or otherwise affected in a readjustment plan. It seems to hold most

edition relating to the Fox Film 6% Notes, due 1936, which in 1933 were selling at 75 to yield
20% to maturity.
Further Example: In 1938 Tung Sol Lamp Company 4% Notes, due 1941, were selling at
50. The very small size of this issue, in relation to the company’s resources and earnings,
made payment apparently certain. (In fact they were called in 1939 in advance of maturity.)

consistently in cases where liquidation or a sale to outside interests results
ultimately in a cash distribution or its equivalent.
Examples: Three typical examples of such a consummation are given
herewith.

defaulted interest payment on July 1, 1932. About this time the bonds sold
as low as 21. The Hydro-Electric Commission of Ontario purchased the
property soon afterwards, on a basis that gave $900 of new debentures,
fully guaranteed by the Province of Ontario, for each $1,000 Ontario
Power Service bond. The new debentures were quoted at 90 in December
1933, equivalent to 81 for the old bonds. The small number of bondhold-
ers not making the exchange received 70% in cash.

1/2s, Due 1936 .R e c e i v e r s  w e r e
appointed in February 1932. The bonds were quoted at 4 in April 1932.
In June 1932 the properties were sold to outside interests, and liquidat-
ing dividends of 12
1/2% and 2% were paid in August 1932 and March
1933. In December 1933 the bonds were still quoted at 4, indicating
expectation of at least that amount in further distributions.
3. Fisk Rubber Company First 8s and Debenture 5
1/2s, Due 1941 and
1931. Information regarding these issues was given in Chap. 18.
Receivership was announced in January 1931. In 1932 the 8s and 5
1/2s
sold as low as 16 and 10 1/2 respectively. In 1933 a reorganization was
effected, which distributed 40% in cash on the 8s and 37% on the 5 1/2s,
together with securities of two successor companies. The aggregate val-
ues of the cash and the new securities at the close of 1933 came close to
100% for the 8% bonds and 70% for the debenture 5
1/2s.
Price Patterns Produced by Insolvency. Certain price patterns are

especially if they are protracted. In the first place, there is often a ten-
dency for the stock issues to sell too high, not only in relation to the price
of the bond issues but also absolutely, i.e., in relation to their probable
ultimate value. This is due to the incidence of speculative interest, which
is attracted by a seemingly low price range. In the case of senior issues,
popular interest steadily decreases, and the price tends to decline accord-
ingly, as the proceedings wear on. Consequently, the lowest levels are
likely to be reached a short time before a reorganization plan is ready to 
be announced.

A profitable field of analytical activity should be found therefore in
keeping in close touch with such situations, endeavoring to discover secu-
rities that appear to be selling far under their intrinsic value and to deter-
mine approximately the best time for making a commitment in them. But
in these, as in all analytical situations, we must warn against an endeavor
to gage too nicely the proper time to buy. An essential characteristic of
security analysis, as we understand it, is that the time factor is a subordi-
nate consideration. Hence our use of the qualifying word “approximately, ”
which is intended to allow a leeway of several months and sometimes
even longer, in judging the “right time” to enter upon the operation.
Opportunities in Railroad Trusteeships. In the years following
1932 a large part of the country’s railroad mileage went into the hands of
trustees. At the close of 1938 a total of 111 railway companies operating
78,016 miles (31% of the total railway mileage in the United States) were
in the hands of receivers or trustees. This is the greatest mileage ever in
the hands of the courts at any one time. Reorganization in every case has
been long delayed, owing on the one hand to the complicated capital
structures to be dealt with and on the other to the uncertainty as to future
normal earnings. As a result the price of a great many issues fell to
extremely low levels—which would undoubtedly have presented excel-
lent opportunities for the shrewd investor, had it not been that the earn-
ings of the railroads as a whole continued for some years to make
disappointing showings as compared with general business.
Viewing the situation about the end of 1939, it appeared that many of
the first-mortgage liens on important mileage had fallen to lower levels
than were warranted by anything but a most pessimistic view of the future
of the carriers. Certainly, these issues were cheaper than the bonds and
stocks of solvent roads, which sold for the most part at liberal prices in
relation to their current exhibits and which in many cases would be in
danger of insolvency if future conditions turned out as badly as the low
price of trusteeships issues seemed to  anticipate. The technique of ana-
lyzing issues of the latter group is covered on accompanying CD in Chap.
12 and in Appendix Note 66, page 821.

Chapter 51
DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN PRICE
AND VALUE (Continued)
THE PRACTICAL DISTINCTIONS drawn in our last chapter between leading
and secondary common stocks have their counterpart in the field of sen-
ior securities as between seasoned and unseasoned issues. A seasoned
issue may be defined as an issue of a company long and favorably known
to the investment public. (The security itself may be of recent creation so
long as the company has a high reputation among investors.) Seasoned
and unseasoned issues tend at times to follow divergent patterns of con-
duct in the market, viz.:
1. The price of seasoned issues is often maintained despite a considerable
weakening of their investment position.
2. Unseasoned issues are very sensitive to adverse developments of any
nature. Hence they often fall to prices far lower than seem to be warranted
by their statistical exhibit.
Price Inertia of Seasoned Issues. These opposite characteristics are
due, in part at least, to the inertia and lack of penetration of the typical
investor. He buys by reputation rather than by analysis and he holds tena-
ciously to what he has bought. Hence holders of long-established issues
do not sell them readily, and even a small decline in price attracts buyers
long familiar with the security.
Example: This trait of seasoned issues is well illustrated by the market
history of the United States Rubber Company 8% Noncumulative Preferred.
The issue received full dividends between 1905 and 1927. In each year of
this period except 1924 there were investors who paid higher than par for
this stock. Its popularity was based entirely upon its reputation and its 
dividend record, for the statistical exhibit of the company during most of
the period was anything but impressive, even for an industrial bond, and

hence ridiculously inadequate to justify the purchase of a noncumulative
industrial preferred stock. Between the years 1922 and 1927, the following
coverage was shown for interest charges and preferred dividends combined:
1 A more recent example of the same kind is presented by Curtis Publishing 7% Preferred,
which sold at 114 in 1936 and 1091/2 in 1937, despite an exceedingly inadequate showing of
earnings (and tangible assets). The high price of many railroad bonds in those years,
notwithstanding their unsatisfactory earnings exhibit, illustrates this point more broadly.

In 1928 the stock sold as high as 109. During that year the company
sustained an enormous loss, and the preferred dividend was discontin-
ued. Despite the miserable showing and the absence of any dividend, the
issue actually sold at 92
1/2 in 1929. (In 1932 it sold at 31/8.)1
Vulnerability of Unseasoned Issues.Turning to unseasoned issues,
we may point out that these belong almost entirely to the industrial field.
The element of seasoning plays a very small part as between the various
senior issues of the railroads; and in the public-utility group proper (i.e.,
electric, manufactured gas, telephone and water companies) price varia-
tions will be found to follow the statistical showing fairly closely, without
being strongly influenced by the factor of popularity or familiarity—
except in the case of very small concerns.
Industrial financing has brought into the market a continuous stream
of bond and preferred stock issues of companies new to the investment
list. Investors have been persuaded to buy these offerings largely through
the appeal of a yield moderately higher than the standard rate for sea-
soned securities of comparable grade. If the earning power is maintained
uninterruptedly after issuance, the new security naturally proves a satis-
factory commitment. But any adverse development will ordinarily induce
a severe decline in the market price. This vulnerability of unseasoned
issues gives rise to the practical conclusion that it is unwise to buy a new
industrial bond or preferred stock for straight investment.

---
**[Page 742]**

Since such issues are unduly sensitive to unfavorable developments,
it would seem that the price would often fall too low and in that case they
would afford attractive opportunities to purchase. This is undoubtedly
true, but there is great need of caution in endeavoring to take advantage
of these disparities. In the first place, the disfavor accorded to unseasoned
securities in the market is not merely a subjective matter, due to lack of
knowledge. Seasoning is usually defined as an objective quality, arising
from a demonstrated ability to weather business storms. Although this
definition is not entirely accurate, there is enough truth in it to justify in
good part the investor’s preference for seasoned issues.
More important, perhaps, is the broad distinction of size and promi-
nence that can be drawn between seasoned and unseasoned securities.
The larger companies are generally the older companies, having senior
issues long familiar to the public. Hence unseasoned bonds and preferred
stocks are for the most part issues of concerns of secondary importance.
But we have pointed out, in our discussion of industrial investments
(Chap. 7), that in this field dominant size may reasonably be considered
a most desirable trait. It follows, therefore, that in this respect unseasoned
issues must suffer as a class from a not inconsiderable disadvantage.
Unseasoned Industrial Issues Rarely Deserve an Investment Rating.The
logical and practical result is that unseasoned industrial issues can very
rarely deserve an investment rating, and consequently they should only
be bought on an admittedly speculative basis. This requires in turn that
the market price be low enough to permit of a substantial rise; e.g., the
price must ordinarily be below 70.
It will be recalled that in our treatment of speculative senior issues
(Chap. 26), we referred to the price sector of about 70 to 100 as the “range
of subjective variation, ” in which an issue might properly sell because of
a legitimate difference of opinion as to whether or not it was sound. It
seems, however, that in the case of unseasoned industrial bonds or pre-
ferred stocks the analyst should not be attracted by a price level within
this range, even though the quantitative showing be quite satisfactory. 
He should favor such issues only when they can be bought at a frankly
speculative price.
Exception may be made to this rule when the statistical exhibit is
extraordinarily strong, as perhaps in the case of the Fox Film 6% notes men-
tioned in the preceding chapter and described in Appendix Note 67, 
[690] SECURITY ANALYSIS

page 835 on accompanying CD. We doubt if such exceptions can prudently
include any unseasoned industrial preferred stocks, because of the contrac-
tual weakness of such issues. (In the case of Congoleum preferred, described
above, the company was of dominant size in its field, and the preferred stock
was not so much “unseasoned” as it was inactive marketwise.)
Discrepancies in Comparative Prices. Comparisons may or may
not be odious, but they hold a somewhat deceptive fascination for the ana-
lyst. It seems a much simpler process to decide that issue A is preferable
to issue B than to determine that issue A is an attractive purchase in its
own right. But in our chapter on comparative analysis we have alluded to
the particular responsibility that attaches to the recommendation of secu-
rity exchanges, and we have warned against an overready acceptance of a
purely quantitative superiority. The future is often no respecter of statis-
tical data. We may frame this caveat in another way by suggesting that the
analyst should not urge a security exchange unless either (1) the issue to
be bought is attractive, regarded by itself, or (2) there is a definite contrac-
tual relationship between the two issues in question. Let us illustrate con-
sideration (1) by two examples of comparisons taken from our records.
Examples: I. Comparison Made in March 1932.
Ward Baking First 6s,  Bethlehem Steel First & Ref. 
due 1937. Price 851/4, 5s, due 1942. Price 93,

Total interest charges earned:
1931 8.1 times 1.0 times
1930 8.2 times 4.3 times
1929 11.0 times 4.8 times
1928 11.2 times 2.7 times
1927 14.0 times 2.3 times
1926 14.5 times 2.6 times
1925 12.6 times 2.1 times
Seven-year average 11.4 times 2.8 times
Amount of bond issues $ 4,546,000 $145,000,000*
Market value of stock issues 
(March ’32 average) 12,200,000 116,000,000
Cash assets 3,438,000 50,300,000
Net working capital 3,494,000 116,300,000
* Including guaranteed stock.

**[Page 744]**

In this comparison the Ward Baking issue made a far stronger statis-
tical showing than the Bethlehem Steel bonds. Furthermore, it appeared
sufficiently well protected to justify an investment rating, despite the high
return. The qualitative factors, although not impressive, did not suggest
any danger of collapse of the business. Hence the bonds could be recom-
mended either as an original purchase or as an advantageous substitute
for the Bethlehem Steel 5s.
II. Comparison Made in March 1929.
[692] SECURITY ANALYSIS
Spear & Co. (Furniture  Republic Iron & 
Stores) 7% First Steel 7% Preferred.

1925 2.5 times 1.7 times
1924 4.7 times 1.1 times
1923 6.5 times 2.5 times
1922 4.3 times 0.5 times
Seven-year average 3.9 times 1.6 times
Amount of bond issues None $32,700,000
Amount of (1st) preferred issue $ 3,900,000 25,000,000

Net working capital 10,460,000 21,500,000
* Includes Second Preferred estimated at 50.
In this comparison the Spear and Company issue undoubtedly made
a better statistical showing than Republic Iron and Steel Preferred. Taken
by itself, however, its exhibit was not sufficiently impressive to carry con-
viction of investment merit, considering the type of business and the fact
that we were dealing with a preferred stock. The price of the issue was
not low enough to warrant recommendation on a fully speculative basis,
i.e., with prime emphasis on the opportunity for enhancement of princi-
pal. This meant in turn that it could not consistently be recommended in
exchange for another issue, such as Republic Iron and Steel Preferred.

Comparison of Definitely Related Issues. When the issues exam-
ined are definitely related, a different situation obtains. An exchange can
then be considered solely from the standpoint of the respective merits
within the given situation; the responsibility for entering into or remain-
ing in the situation need not be assumed by the analyst. In our previous
chapters we have considered a number of cases in which relative prices
were clearly out of line, permitting authoritative recommendations of
exchange. These disparities arise from the frequent failure of the general
market to recognize the effect of contractual provisions and often also
from a tendency for speculative markets to concentrate attention on the
common stocks and to neglect the senior securities. Examples of the first
type were given in our discussion of price discrepancies involving 
guaranteed issues in Chap. 17. The price discrepancies between various
Interborough Rapid Transit Company issues, discussed in Appendix Note
56 on accompanying CD, and between Brooklyn Union Elevated Rail-
road 5s and Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation 6s, referred to in
Chap. 2, are other illustrations in this category.
2
The illogical price relationships between a senior convertible issue and
the common stock, discussed in Chap. 25 on accompanying CD, are exam-
ples of opportunities arising from the concentration of speculative interest
on the more active junior shares. A different manifestation of the same gen-
eral tendency is shown by the spread of 7 points existing in August 1933
between the price of American Water Works and Electric Company “free”
common and the less active voting trust certificates for the same issue. Such
phenomena invite not only direct exchanges but also hedging operations.
A similar comparison could be made in July 1933 between Southern
Railway 5% Noncumulative Preferred, paying no dividend and selling at
49, and the Mobile and Ohio Stock Trust Certificates, which were an obli-
gation of the same road, bearing a perpetual guaranty of a 4% dividend
and selling concurrently at 39
3/4. Even if the preferred dividend had been
immediately resumed and continued without interruption, the yield
2 The student is invited to consider the price relationships between Pierce Petroleum and
Pierce Oil preferred and common in 1929; between Central States Electric Corporation
51/2% bonds and North American Company common in 1934; between the common issues
of Advance-Rumely Corporation and Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company in 1933;
between Ventures, Ltd., and Falconbridge Nickel, and between Chesapeake Corporation and
Chesapeake and Ohio Railway common stocks in 1939—as examples of disparities arising
from ownership by one company of securities in another.

**[Page 746]**

thereon would have been no higher than that obtainable from the senior
fixed-interest obligation. (In 1939 Southern Railway Preferred, still pay-
ing no dividend, sold at 35 against a price of about 40 for the Mobile and
Ohio 4% certificates. At these prices the advantage still appeared clearly
on the side of the guaranteed issue.)
Other and Less Certain Discrepancies. In the foregoing examples the
aberrations are mathematically demonstrable. There is a larger class of
disparities between senior and junior securities that may not be proved
quite so conclusively but are sufficiently certain for practical purposes.
As an example of these, consider Colorado Industrial Company 5s, due
August 1, 1934, guaranteed by Colorado Fuel and Iron Company, which
in May 1933 sold at 43, while the Colorado Fuel and Iron 8% Preferred,
paying no dividend, sold at 45. The bond issue had to be paid off in full
within 14 months’ time, or else the preferred stock was faced with the
possibility of complete extinction through receivership. In order that 
the preferred stock might prove more valuable than the bonds bought at
the same price, it would be necessary not only that the bonds be paid off
at par in little over a year but that preferred dividends be resumed and
back dividends discharged within that short time. This was almost, if not
quite, inconceivable.
In comparing nonconvertible preferred stocks with common stocks
of the same company, we find the same tendency for the latter to sell too
high, relatively, when both issues are on a speculative basis. Comparisons
of this kind can be safely drawn, however, only when the preferred stock
bears cumulative dividends. (The reason for this restriction should be
clear from our detailed discussion of the disabilities of noncumulative
issues in Chap. 15.) A price of 10 for American and Foreign Power Com-
pany common when the $7 Cumulative Second Preferred was selling at
11 in April 1933 was clearly unwarranted. A similar remark may be made
of the price of 21
1/2 for Chicago Great Western Railroad Company com-
mon in February 1927, against 321/2 for the 4% preferred stock on which
dividends of $44 per share had accumulated.
It is true that if extraordinary prosperity should develop in situations
of this kind, the common shares might eventually be worth substantially
more than the preferred. But even if this should occur, the company is
bound to pass through an intermediate period during which the
improved situation permits it to resume preferred dividends and then to
[694] SECURITY ANALYSIS

Additional Aspects of Security Analysis [695]
discharge the accumulations. Since such developments benefit the pre-
ferred stock directly, they are likely to establish (for a while at least) a mar-
ket value for the senior issues far higher than that of the common stock.
Hence, assuming any appreciable degree of improvement, a purchase of
the preferred shares at the low levels should fare better than one made in
the common stock.
Discrepancies Due to Special Supply and Demand Factors.The
illogical relationships that we have been considering grow out of supply
and demand conditions that are, in turn, the product of unthinking spec-
ulative purchases. Sometimes discrepancies are occasioned by special and
temporary causes affecting either demand or supply.
Examples: In the illogical relationship between the prices of Interboro
Rapid Transit Company 5s and 7s in 1933, the operations of a substan-
tial sinking fund, which purchased the 5s and not the 7s, were undoubt-
edly instrumental in raising the price of the former disproportionately.
An outstanding example of this kind is found in the market action 
of United States Liberty 4
1/4s during the postwar readjustment of
1921–1922. Large amounts of these bonds had been bought during the
war for patriotic reasons and financed by bank loans. A general desire 
to liquidate these loans later on induced a heavy volume of sales which
drove the price down. This special selling pressure actually resulted in
establishing a lower price basis for Liberty Bonds than for high-grade rail-
road issues, which were, of course, inferior in security and at a greater
disadvantage also in the matter of taxation. Compare the following simul-
taneous prices in September 1920.
Issue Price Yield
United States Liberty Fourth 41/4s, due 1938 84 1/2 5.64%*
Union Pacific First 4s, due 1947 80 5.42%
* Not allowing for tax exemption.
This situation supplied an excellent opportunity for the securities ana-
lyst to advise exchanges from the old-line railroad issues into Liberty Bonds.
A less striking disparity appeared a little later between the price of
these Liberty Bonds and of United States Victory 4 3/4s, due 1923. This
state of affairs is discussed in a circular, prepared by one of the authors

and issued at that time, a copy of which is given in Appendix Note 68 on
accompanying CD, as an additional example of “practical security analysis. ”
United States Savings Bonds Offer Similar Opportunity.For the
investor of moderate means the disparity between United States government
and corporate obligations has reappeared in recent years. The yield on
United States Savings Bonds (available to any one individual to the extent
of $10,000 principal amount each year) is 2.90% on the regular compound-
interest basis of calculation and 3.33% on a simple-interest basis. This yield
is definitely higher than that returned by best-rated public-utility and indus-
trial issues.
3 In addition to their safety factor, which at present must clearly
be set higher than that of any corporate issue, the United States Savings
Bonds have the minor advantage of exemption from normal income tax and
the major advantage of being redeemable at the option of the holderat any
time, thus guaranteeing him against intermediate loss in market value.
[696] SECURITY ANALYSIS
3 The average yields for such bonds for the first 3 months of 1940, carrying A1/H11001ratings of
Standard Statistics Company, were only 2.62% and 2.44%, respectively.

Chapter 52
MARKET ANALYSIS AND
SECURITY ANALYSIS
FORECASTING SECURITY PRICES is not properly a part of security analysis.
However, the two activities are generally thought to be closely allied, and
they are frequently carried on by the same individuals and organizations.
Endeavors to predict the course of prices have a variety of objectives and
a still greater variety of techniques. Most emphasis is laid in Wall Street
upon the science, or art, or pastime, of prophesying the immediate action
of the “general market, ” which is fairly represented by the various aver-
ages used in the financial press. Some of the services or experts confine
their aim to predicting the longer term trend of the market, purporting
to ignore day-to-day fluctuations and to consider the broader “swings”
covering a period of, say, several months. A great deal of attention is given
also to prophesying the market action of individual issues, as distinct
from the market as a whole.
Market Analysis as a Substitute for or Adjunct to Security
Analysis. Assuming that these activities are carried on with sufficient
seriousness to represent more than mere guesses, we may refer to all or
any of them by the designation of “market analysis. ” In this chapter we
wish to consider the extent to which market analysis may seriously be
considered as a substitute for or a supplement to security analysis. The
question is important. If, as many believe, one can dependably foretell the
movements of stock prices without any reference to the underlying val-
ues, then it would be sensible to confine security analysis to the selection
of fixed-value investments only. For, when it comes to the common-stock
type of issue, it would manifestly be more profitable to master the tech-
nique of determining when to buy or sell, or of selecting the issues that
are going to have the greatest or quickest advance, than to devote
painstaking efforts to forming conclusions about intrinsic value. Many

other people believe that the best results can be obtained by an analysis
of the market position of a stock in conjunction with an analysis of its
intrinsic value. If this is so, the securities analyst who ventures outside
the fixed-value field must qualify as a market analyst as well and be pre-
pared to view each situation from both standpoints at the same time.
It is not within our province to attempt a detailed criticism of the the-
ories and the technique underlying all the different methods of market
analysis. We shall confine ourselves to considering the broader lines of
reasoning that are involved in the major premises of price forecasting.
Even with this sketchy treatment it should be possible to reach some use-
ful conclusions on the perplexing question of the relationship between
market analysis and security analysis.
Two Kinds of Market Analysis.A distinction may be made between
two kinds of market analysis. The first finds the material for its predic-
tions exclusively in the past action of the stock market. The second con-
siders all sorts of economic factors, e.g., business conditions, general and
specific; money rates; the political outlook. (The market’s behavior is itself
only one of these numerous elements of study.) The underlying theory of
the first approach may be summed up in the declaration that “the market
is its own best forecaster. ” The behavior of the market is generally studied
by means of charts on which are plotted the movements of individual
stocks or of “averages. ” Those who devote themselves primarily to a study
of these price movements are known as “chartists, ” and their procedure is
often called “chart reading. ”
But it must be pointed out that much present-day market analysis rep-
resents a combination of the two kinds described, in the sense that the mar-
ket’s action alone constitutes the predominant but not the exclusive field of
study. General economic indications play a subordinate but still significant
role. Considerable latitude is therefore left for individual judgment, not only
in interpreting the technical indications of the market’s action but also in
reconciling such indications with outside factors. The “Dow theory, ” how-
ever, which is the best known method of market analysis, limits itself essen-
tially to a study of the market’s behavior. Hence we feel justified in dealing
separately with chart reading as applied exclusively to stock prices.
Implication of the First Type of Market Analysis.It must be recognized
that the vogue of such “technical study” has increased immensely during
the past fifteen years. Whereas security analysis suffered a distinct

loss of prestige beginning about 1927—from which it has not entirely 
recovered—chart reading apparently increased the number of its follow-
ers even during the long depression and in the years thereafter. Many
sceptics, it is true, are inclined to dismiss the whole procedure as akin to
astrology or necromancy, but the sheer weight of its importance in Wall
Street requires that its pretensions be examined with some degree of care.
In order to confine our discussion within the framework of logical rea-
soning, we shall purposely omit even a condensed summary of the main
tenets of chart reading.
1 We wish to consider only the implications of the
general idea that a study confined to past price movements can be availed
of profitably to foretell the movements of the future.
Such consideration, we believe, should lead to the following conclusions:
1. Chart reading cannot possibly be a science.
2. It has not proved itself in the past to be a dependable method of making
profits in the stock market.
3. Its theoretical basis rests upon faulty logic or else upon mere assertion.
4. Its vogue is due to certain advantages it possesses over haphazard specu-
lation, but these advantages tend to diminish as the number of chart 
students increases.
1. Chart Reading Not a Science and Its Practice Cannot Be Continu-
ously Successful. That chart reading cannot be a science is clearly demon-
strable. If it were a science, its conclusions would be as a rule dependable.
In that case everybody could predict tomorrow’s or next week’s price
changes, and hence everyone could make money continuously by buying
and selling at the right time. This is patently impossible. A moment’s
thought will show that there can be no such thing as a scientific predic-
tion of economic events under human control. The very “dependability”
of such a prediction will cause human actions that will invalidate it. Hence
thoughtful chartists admit that continued success is dependent upon
keeping the successful method known to only a few people.
1 For detailed statements concerning the theory and practice of chart reading the student is
referred to: R. W . Shabacker, Stock Market Profits, B. C. Forbes, New Y ork, 1934; Robert
Rhea, “The Dow Theory, ” passim, Barron’s, New Y ork, 1932; H. M. Gartley, “ Analyzing the
Stock Market, ” a series of articles in Barron’sbeginning with the issue of Sept. 19, 1932 and
ending with the issue of Dec. 5, 1932. See Appendix Note 69, p. 837 on accompanying CD,
for a brief statement of the main tenets of the Dow theory.

2. Because of this fact it follows that there is no generally known
method of chart reading that has been continuously successful for a long
period of time.2 If it were known, it would be speedily adopted by num-
berless traders. This very following would bring its usefulness to an end.
3. Theoretical Basis Open to Question. The theoretical basis of chart
reading runs somewhat as follows:
a. The action of the market (or of a particular stock) reflects the activities
and the attitude of those interested in it.
b. Therefore, by studying the record of market action, we can tell what is
going to happen next in the market.
The premise may well be true, but the conclusion does not necessar-
ily follow. Y ou may learn a great deal about the technical position of a
stock by studying its chart, and yet you may not learn enough to permit
you to operate profitably in the issue. A good analogy is provided by the
“past performances” of race horses, which are so assiduously studied by
the devotees of the race track. Undoubtedly these charts afford consider-
able information concerning the relative merits of the entries; they will
often enable the student to pick the winner of a race; but the trouble is
that they do not furnish that valuable information often enough to make
betting on horse races a profitable diversion.
Coming nearer home, we have a similar situation in security analysis
itself. The past earnings of a company supply a useful indication of its
future earnings—useful, but not infallible. Security analysis and market
analysis are alike, therefore, in the fact that they deal with data that are
not conclusive as to the future. The difference, as we shall point out, is
that the securities analyst can protect himself by a margin of safetythat is
denied to the market analyst.
Undoubtedly, there are times when the behavior of the market, as
revealed on the charts, carries a definite and trustworthy meaning of par-
ticular value to those who are skilled in its interpretation. If reliance on
chart indications were confined to those really convincing cases, a more
positive argument could be made in favor of “technical study. ” But such
[700] SECURITY ANALYSIS
2 Adherents of the Dow theory claim that it has been continuously successful for a great
many years. We believe this statement to be open to much doubt—turning, in part, on 
certain disputed interpretations of what the theory indicated on various key occasions.

precise signals seem to occur only at wide intervals, and in the meantime
human impatience plus the exigencies of the chart reader’s profession
impel him to draw more frequent conclusions from less convincing data.
4. Other Theoretical and Practical Weaknesses. The appeal of chart
reading to the stock-market trader is something like that of a patent med-
icine to an incurable invalid. The stock speculator does suffer, in fact,
from a well-nigh incurable ailment. The cure he seeks, however, is not
abstinence from speculation but profits. Despite all experience, he per-
suades himself that these can be made and retained; he grasps greedily
and uncritically at every plausible means to this end.
The plausibility of chart reading, in our opinion, derives largely from
its insistence on the sound gambling maxim that losses should be cut
short and profits allowed to run. This principle usually prevents sudden
large losses, and at times it permits a large profit to be taken. The results
are likely to be better, therefore, than those produced by the haphazard
following of “market tips. ” Traders, noticing this advantage, are certain
that by developing the technique of chart reading farther they will so
increase its reliability as to assure themselves continued profits.
But in this conclusion there lurks a double fallacy. Many players at
roulette follow a similar system, which limits their losses at any one session
and permits them at times to realize a substantial gain. But in the end they
always find that the aggregate of small losses exceeds the few large profits.
(This must be so, since the mathematical odds against them are inexorable
over a period of time.) The same is true of the stock trader, who will find
that the expense of trading weights the dice heavily against him. A second
difficulty is that, as the methods of chart reading gain in popularity, the
amount of the loss taken in unprofitable trades tends to increase and 
the profits also tend to diminish. For as more and more people, following
the same system, receive the signal to buy at about the same time, the result
of this competitive buying must be that a higher average price is paid by
the group. Conversely, when this larger group decides to sell out at the same
time, either to cut short a loss or to protect a profit, the effect must again
be that a lower average price is received. (The growth in the use of “stop-
loss orders, ” formerly a helpful technical device of the trader, had this very
effect of detracting greatly from their value as a protective measure.)
The more intelligent chart students recognize these theoretical weak-
nesses, we believe, and take the view that market forecasting is an art that

---
**[Page 754]**

requires talent, judgment, intuition and other personal qualities. They
admit that no rules of procedure can be laid down, the automatic follow-
ing of which will insure success. Hence the widespread tendency in Wall
Street circles towards a composite or eclectic approach, in which a very
thorough study of the market’s performance is projected against the 
general economic background, and the whole is subjected to the appraisal
of experienced judgment.
The Second Type of Mechanical Forecasting. Before considering
the significance of this injection of the judgment factor, let us pass on to
the other type of mechanical forecasting, which is based upon factors out-
side of the market itself. As far as the general market is concerned, the
usual procedure is to construct indices representing various economic
factors, e.g., money rates, carloadings, steel production, and to deduce
impending changes in the market from an observation of a recent change
in these indices.
3 One of the earliest methods of the kind, and a very sim-
ple one, was based upon the percentage of blast furnaces in operation.
This theory was developed by Col. Leonard P . Ayres of the Cleveland
Trust Company and ran to the effect that security prices usually reached
a bottom when blast furnaces in operation declined through 60% of the
total and that conversely they usually reached a top when blast furnaces
in operation passed through the 60% mark on the upswing in use
thereof.
4 A companion theory of Colonel Ayres was that the high point
in bond prices is reached about 14 months subsequent to the low point
in pig-iron production and that the peak in stock prices is reached about
two years following the low point for pig-iron production.
5
This simple method is representative of all mechanical forecasting 
systems, in that (1) it sounds vaguely plausible on the basis of a priori
[702] SECURITY ANALYSIS
3 These indices may also be plotted on charts, in which case the forecasting takes on the
aspect of chart reading. Examples: The A, B, and C lines of the Harvard Economic Service
which were published in weekly letters from Jan. 3, 1922, to Dec. 26, 1931 (since continued
through 1939 at less frequent intervals in The Review of Economic Statistics); also the single
composite Index Line in the “Investment Timing Service” offered by Independence Fund of
North America, Inc., in 1939.
4 See Bulletin of the Cleveland Trust Company, July 15, 1924, cited by David F . Jordan, in 
Practical Business Forecasting, p. 203n, New Y ork, 1927.
5 See Business Recovery Following Depression, a pamphlet published by the Cleveland Trust
Company in 1922. The conclusions of Colonel Ayres are summarized on p. 31 of the pamphlet.

reasoning and (2) it relies for its convincingness on the fact that it has
“worked” for a number of years past. The necessary weakness of all these
systems lies in the time element. It is easy and safe to prophesy, for exam-
ple, that a period of high interest rates will lead to a sharp decline in the
market. The question is, “How soon?” There is no scientific way of answer-
ing this question. Many of the forecasting services are therefore driven to
a sort of pseudo-science, in which they take it for granted that certain time
lags or certain coincidences that happened to occur several times in the
past (or have been worked out laboriously by a process of trial and error),
can be counted upon to occur in much the same way in the future.
Broadly speaking, therefore, the endeavor to forecast security-price
changes by reference to mechanical indices is open to the same objections
as the methods of the chart readers. They are not truly scientific, because
there is no convincing reasoning to support them and because, further-
more, really scientific (i.e., entirely dependable) forecasting in the economic
field is a logical impossibility.
Disadvantages of Market Analysis as Compared with Security
Analysis. We return in consequence to our earlier conclusion that mar-
ket analysis is an art for which special talent is needed in order to pur-
sue it successfully. Security analysis is also an art; and it, too, will not
yield satisfactory results unless the analyst has ability as well as knowl-
edge. We think, however, that security analysis has several advantages
over market analysis, which are likely to make the former a more suc-
cessful field of activity for those with training and intelligence. In secu-
rity analysis the prime stress is laid upon protection against untoward
events. We obtain this protection by insisting upon margins of safety, or
values well in excess of the price paid. The underlying idea is that even
if the security turns out to be less attractive than it appeared, the com-
mitment might still prove a satisfactory one. In market analysis there are
no margins of safety; you are either right or wrong, and, if you are wrong,
you lose money.
6
6 Viewing the two activities as possible professions, we are inclined to draw an analogous
comparison between the law and the concert stage. A talented lawyer should be able to make
a respectable living; a talented, i.e., a “merely talented, ” musician faces heartbreaking obsta-
cles to a successful concert career. Thus, as we see it, a thoroughly competent securities ana-
lyst should be able to obtain satisfactory results from his work, whereas permanent success
as a market analyst requires unusual qualities—or unusual luck.

---
**[Page 756]**

The cardinal rule of the market analyst that losses should be cut short
and profits safeguarded (by selling when a decline commences) leads in
the direction of active trading. This means in turn that the cost of buy-
ing and selling becomes a heavily adverse factor in aggregate results.
Operations based on security analysis are ordinarily of the investment
type and do not involve active trading.
A third disadvantage of market analysis is that it involves essentially
a battle of wits. Profits made by trading in the market are for the most
part realized at the expense of others who are trying to do the same
thing. The trader necessarily favors the more active issues, and the price
changes in these are the resultant of the activities of numerous operators
of his own type. The market analyst can be hopeful of success only upon
the assumption that he will be more clever or perhaps luckier than his
competitors.
The work of the securities analyst, on the other hand, is in no similar
sense competitive with that of his fellow analysts. In the typical case the
issue that he elects to buy is not sold by some one who has made an
equally painstaking analysis of its value. We must emphasize the point
that the security analyst examines a far larger list of securities than does
the market analyst. Out of this large list, he selects the exceptional cases
in which the market price falls far short of reflecting intrinsic value, either
through neglect or because of undue emphasis laid upon unfavorable 
factors that are probably temporary.
Market analysis seems easier than security analysis, and its rewards
may be realized much more quickly. For these very reasons, it is likely to
prove more disappointing in the long run. There are no dependable ways
of making money easily and quickly, either in Wall Street or anywhere else.
Prophesies Based on Near-term Prospects.A good part of the analy-
sis and advice supplied in the financial district rests upon the near-term
business prospects of the company considered. It is assumed that, if the out-
look favors increased earnings, the issue should be bought in the expecta-
tion of a higher price when the larger profits are actually reported. In this
reasoning, security analysis and market analysis are made to coincide. The
market prospect is thought to be identical with the business prospect.
But to our mind the theory of buying stocks chiefly upon the basis of
their immediate outlook makes the selection of speculative securities
entirely too simple a matter. Its weakness lies in the fact that the current
[704] SECURITY ANALYSIS

---

Additional Aspects of Security Analysis [705]
market price already takes into account the consensus of opinion as to
future prospects. And in many cases the prospects will have been given
more than their just need of recognition. When a stock is recommended
for the reason that next year’s earnings are expected to show improve-
ment, a twofold hazard is involved. First, the forecast of next year’s results
may prove incorrect; second, even if correct, it may have been discounted
or even overdiscounted in the current price.
If markets generally reflected only this year’s earnings, then a good esti-
mate of next year’s results would be of inestimable value. But the premise
is not correct. Our table on page 707 shows on the one hand the annual
earnings per share of United States Steel Corporation common and on the
other hand the price range of that issue for the years 1902–1939. Exclud-
ing the 1928–1933 period (in which business changes were so extreme as
necessarily to induce corresponding changes in stock prices), it is difficult
to establish any definite correlation between fluctuations in earnings and
fluctuations in market quotations.
In Appendix Note 70 (on accompanying CD), we reproduce signifi-
cant parts of the analysis and recommendation concerning two common
stocks made by an important statistical and advisory service in the latter
part of 1933. The recommendations are seen to be based largely upon the
apparent outlook for 1934. There is no indication of any endeavor to
ascertain the fair value of the business and to compare this value with the
current price. A thorough-going statistical analysis would point to the
conclusion that the issue of which the sale is advised was selling below its
intrinsic value, just because of the unfavorable immediate prospects, and
that the opposite was true of the common stock recommended as worth
holding because of its satisfactory outlook.
We are sceptical of the ability of the analyst to forecast with a fair
degree of success the market behavior of individual issues over the near-
term future—whether he base his predictions upon the technical posi-
tion of the market or upon the general outlook for business or upon the
specific outlook for the individual companies. More satisfactory results
are to be obtained, in our opinion, by confining the positive conclusions
of the analyst to the following fields of endeavor:
1. The selection of standard senior issues that meet exacting tests of safety.
2. The discovery of senior issues that merit an investment rating but that
also have opportunities of an appreciable enhancement in value.

---
**[Page 758]**

3. The discovery of common stocks, or speculative senior issues, that appear
to be selling at far less than their intrinsic value.
4. The determination of definite price discrepancies existing between related
securities, which situations may justify making exchanges or initiating
hedging or arbitrage operations.
A SUMMARY OF OUR VIEWS ON 
INVESTMENT POLICIES
If we transfer our attention, finally, from the analyst to the owner of secu-
rities, we may briefly express our views on what he may soundly do and
not do. The following résumé makes some allowance for different cate-
gories of investors.
A. The Investor of Small Means. 1. Investment for Income. In his case
the only sensible investment for safety and accumulated income, under pres-
ent conditions, is found in United States Savings Bonds. Other good invest-
ments yield little if any more, and they have not equal protection against
both ultimate and intermediate loss. Straight bonds and preferred stocks
ostensibly offering a higher return are almost certain to involve an appre-
ciable risk factor. The various types of “savings plans” and similar securi-
ties offered by salesmen are full of pitfalls; the investor persuaded by their
promise of liberal income to prefer them to United States Savings Bonds
is very, very likely to regret his choice.
2. Investment for Profit. Four approaches are open to both the small
and the large investor:
a. Purchase of representative common stocks when the market level
is clearly low as judged by objective, long-term standards. This policy
requires patience and courage and is by no means free from the possibil-
ity of grave miscalculation. Over a long period we believe that it will show
good results.
b. Purchase of individual issues with special growth possibilities,
when these can be obtained at reasonable prices in relation to actual
accomplishment.
Where growth is generally expected, the price is rarely reasonable. If
the basis of purchase is a confidence in future growth not held by the pub-
lic, the operation may prove sound and profitable; it may also prove ill-
founded and costly.
c. Purchase of well-secured privileged senior issues. A combination of
really adequate security with a promising conversion or similar right is a

rare but by no means unknown phenomenon. A policy of careful selec-
tion in this field should bring good results, provided the investor has the
patience and persistence needed to find his opportunities.
d. Purchase of securities selling well below intrinsic value. Intrinsic
value takes into account not only past earnings and liquid asset values but
also future earning power, conservatively estimated—in other words,
qualitative as well as quantitative elements. We think that since a large
percentage of all issues nowadays are relatively unpopular, there must be
many cases in which the market goes clearly and crassly astray, thus cre-
ating real opportunities for the discriminating student. These may be
found in bonds, preferred stocks and common stocks.
In our view, the search for and the recognition of security values of
the types just discussed are not beyond the competence of the small
investor who wishes to practice security analysis in a nonprofessional
capacity, although he will undoubtedly need better than average intelli-
gence and training. But we think it should be a necessary rule that the
nonprofessional investor submit his ideas to the criticism of a professional
analyst, such as the statistician of a New Y ork Stock Exchange firm. Surely
modesty is not incompatible with self-confidence; and there is logic in
the thought that unless a man is qualified to advise others professionally,
he should not, unaided, prescribe for himself.
3. Speculation. The investor of small means is privileged, of course,
to step out of his role and become a speculator. (He is also privileged to
regret his action afterwards.) There are various types of speculation, and
they offer varying chances of success:
a. Buying stock in new or virtually new ventures. This we can con-
demn unhesitatingly and with emphasis. The odds are so strongly
against the man who buys into these new flotations that he might as
well throw three-quarters of the money out of the window and keep the
rest in the bank.
b. Trading in the market. It is fortunate for Wall Street as an institu-
tion that a small minority of people can trade successfully and that many
others think they can. The accepted view holds that stock trading is like
anything else; i.e., with intelligence and application, or with good profes-
sional guidance, profits can be realized. Our own opinion is sceptical, per-
haps jaundiced. We think that, regardless of preparation and method,
success in trading is either accidental and impermanent or else due to a
[708] SECURITY ANALYSIS

**[Page 761]**

Additional Aspects of Security Analysis [709]
highly uncommon talent. Hence the vast majority of stock traders are
inevitably doomed to failure. W e do not expect this conclusion to have
much effect on the public. (Note our basic distinction between purchas-
ing stocks at objectively low levels and selling them at high levels—which
we term investment—and the popular practice of buying only when the
market is “expected” to advance and selling when it is “due” to decline—
which we call speculation.)
c. Purchase of “growth stocks” at generous prices. In calling this “spec-
ulation, ” we contravene most authoritative views. For reasons previously
expressed, we consider this popular approach to be inherently dangerous
and increasingly so as it becomes more popular. But the chances of indi-
vidual success are much brighter here than in the other forms of specu-
lation, and there is a better field for the exercise of foresight, judgment
and moderation.
B. The Individual Investor of Large Means.Although he has obvi-
ous technical advantages over the small investor, he suffers from three
special handicaps:
1. He cannot solve his straight investment problem simply by buying
nothing but United States Savings Bonds, since the amount that any indi-
vidual may purchase is limited. Hence he must, perforce, consider the
broader field of fixed-value investment. We believe that strict application
of quantitative tests, plus reasonably good judgment in the qualitative
area, should afford a satisfactory end result.
2. However, the extraneous problem of possible inflation is more seri-
ous to him than to the small investor. Since 1932 there has been a strong
common-sense argument for some common-stock holdings as a defen-
sive measure. In addition, a substantial holding of common stocks corre-
sponds with the traditional attitude and practice of the wealthy individual.
3. The size of his investment unit is more likely to induce the large
investor to concentrate on the popular and active issues. To some extent,
therefore, he is handicapped in the application of the undervalued-secu-
rity technique. However, we imagine that a more serious obstacle thereto
will be found in his preferences and prejudices.
C. Investment by Business Corporations. We believe that United
States government bonds, carrying exemption from corporate income
taxes, are almost the only logical medium for such business funds as may

---
**[Page 762]**

properly be invested for a term of years. (Under 1940 conditions short-time
investment involves as much trouble as income.) It seems fairly evident, on
the whole, that other types of investments by business enterprises—whether
in bonds or in stocks—can offer an appreciably higher return only at risk
of loss and of criticism.
D. Institutional Investment. We shall not presume to suggest poli-
cies for financial institutions whose business it is to be versed in the the-
ory and practice of investment. The same might be said for philanthropic
and educational institutions, since these generally have the benefit of
experienced financiers in shaping their financial policies. But in order
not to dodge completely a very difficult issue, we venture the following
final observation: An institution that can manage to get along on the low
income provided by high-grade fixed-value issues should, in our opin-
ion, confine its holdings to this field. We doubt if the better performance
of common-stock indexes over past periods will, in itself, warrant the
heavy responsibilities and the recurring uncertainties that are insepara-
ble from a common-stock investment program. This conclusion may per-
haps be modified either if there is substantial unanimity of view that
inflation must be guarded against or if the insufficiency of income com-
pels search for a higher return. In such case those in charge may be war-
ranted in setting aside a portion of the institution’s funds for
administration in other than fixed-value fields, in accordance with the
canons and technique of security analysis.

[710] SECURITY ANALYSIS
7 Y ale University now follows a policy of investing part of its funds in “equities”—defined as
common stocks and nonpaying senior issues. The percentage varies in accordance with a
fixed formula, somewhat as follows: The initial proportion is 30% of the total fund. Whenever
a rise in the market level advances this figure to 40%, one-eighth of each stock holding is
switched into bonds. Conversely, whenever a decline in the market reduces the proportion to
15%, bonds are sold and one-third additional of each stock is bought. See address of Laurence
G. Tighe, Associate Treasurer of Y ale University entitled “Present Day Investment Problems 
of Endowed Institutions, ” delivered on February 14, 1940 before the Trust Division of the
American Bankers Association. It was summarized in the New York Sunof February 20, 1940.
