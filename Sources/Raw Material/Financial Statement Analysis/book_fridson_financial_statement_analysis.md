Preface to Fifth Edition
T
his fifth edition of Financial Statement Analysis, like its predecessors,
seeks to equip its readers for the practical challenges of contemporary
business. Once again, the intention is to acquaint readers who have already
acquired basic accounting skills with the complications that arise in apply-
ing textbook-derived knowledge to the real world of extending credit and
investing in securities. Just as a swiftly changing environment necessitated
extensiverevisionsandadditionsinthesecondthroughfourtheditions,new
concerns and challenges for users of financial statements have emerged as
the third decade of the twenty-first century unfolds.
A fundamental change reflected in the third edition was the shift of cor-
porations’ executive compensation plans from a focus on reported earnings
toward enhancing shareholder value. Stock options became a major com-
ponent of corporate leaders’ pay. In theory, this new approach aligned the
interests of management and shareholders, but the concept had a dark side.
Chief executive officers who were under growing pressure to boost their
corporations’sharepricescouldnolongerincreasetheirbonusesbygoosing
reported earnings through financial reporting tricks that were transparent
to the stock market. Instead, they had to devise more opaque methods that
gulled investors into believing that the reported earnings gains were real.
Toadapt tothenew environment, corporate managers became farmore
aggressive in misrepresenting their performance. They moved beyond exag-
geration to outright fabrication of earnings through the use of derivatives
and special purpose vehicles that never showed up in financial statements
and had little to do with the production and sale of goods and services. This
insidious trend culminated in colossal accounting scandals involving com-
panies such as Enron and WorldCom, which shook confidence not only in
financial reporting but also in the securities markets.
Government responded to the outrage over financial frauds by enacting
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Under its provisions, a company’s chief
executive officer and chief financial officer were required to attest to the
integrity of the financial statements. They were thereby exposed to greater
risk than formerly of prosecution and conviction for misrepresentation.
Prior to enactment of this legislation, it was not unheard of for a CEO

xii PREFACE
who stood to profit massively from share price appreciation to escape
prosecution by implausibly disavowing knowledge of the fraud and shifting
the consequences to an underling whose compensation was not tied in any
way to the company’s stock price.
Sarbanes-Oxley has had a profound effect. True, the fourth edition of
Financial Statement Analysis examined several major financial reporting
frauds that came to light later than 2002. Upon close examination, how-
ever, those scams turned out to have originated prior to Sarbanes-Oxley’s
passage, but exposed sometime later. By the 2010s, outright, large-scale
financial reporting fraud was rare in the U.S. Compiling this new edition
was not hampered, however, by any shortage of case studies involving
accounting that deceived investors without breaking the law. In addition,
flat-out financial reporting fraud continued to flourish outside the U.S.
Curiously, there have been cases since the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley
in which corporate executives have gone to prison for faking the
financials, yet the CEO managed to escape prosecution. This is an
outcome that Congress clearly sought to prevent. Financial writer Alison
Frankel explained the snag in a July 27, 2012, Reuters article entitled,
“Sarbanes-Oxley’s Lost Promise: Why CEOs Haven’t Been Prosecuted.”
According to the legislation, a top corporate executive who knowingly
signs off on a false financial report is subject to a 10-year prison term and
a fine of up to $1 million. The penalties rise to 20 years and $5 million
if the misconduct is willful. In practice, few executives were convicted or
even charged with false certification in the first decade after passage of
Sarbanes-Oxley.
Federal prosecutors attributed this to the fact that most major corpora-
tions responded to the new law by instituting multiple layers of subcertifi-
cation. They required lower-level officials to affirm the financial statements’
accuracy. The subcertifications insulated CEOs and CFOs from charges of
false certification, making it difficult to impossible for prosecutors to prove
that they signed financial reports they knew to be false.
Frankel noted that the subcertification process has forced corpora-
tions to be more vigilant at all levels about financial reporting. That likely
accountedforthepaucityofmajoraccountingscandalssubsequentto2002.
In short, Sarbanes-Oxley has succeeded in deterring untruthful reporting
thatrisestothelevelofafelony.Ascasestudiespresentedinthisfifthedition
of Financial Statement Analysis demonstrate, however, legal subterfuges
continue to expose investors and creditors to highly unpleasant surprises.
Sometimes, too, corporate executives still cross the line into criminality.
Therefore, users of financial statements still cannot breathe easy.
In a somewhat more favorable development, corporations’ passion
for granting stock options to senior managers cooled somewhat after

the Financial Accounting Standards Board instituted FAS 123R, a 2006
financial accounting standard introduced by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) requiring annual expensing of equity-based
employee compensation amounts. The result was some shift from stock
option to restricted stock units (RSUs). Unlike options, which can lose all
their value if the company’s stock price falls, RSUs retain part of their value
if that happens. Emphasizing RSUs rather than options somewhat reduces
management’s incentive to raise the share price by artificial means.
Tohelpreadersavoidbeingmisledbydeceptivefinancialstatements,we
continue to prescribe a combination of solid understanding of accounting
principles with a corporate finance perspective. We facilitate such integra-
tion of disciplines throughout the book, making excursions into economics
and business management as well. In addition, we encourage analysts to
consider the institutional context in which financial reporting occurs. Orga-
nizational pressures result in divergences from elegant theories, both in the
conduct of financial statement analysis and in auditors’ interpretations of
accounting principles. The issuers of financial statements also exert a strong
influenceoverthecreationoftheaccountingprinciples,withpowerfulpoliti-
cians sometimes carrying their water.
Asinpreviouseditions,wehighlightsuccessstoriesinthecriticalexami-
nationoffinancialstatements.Whereverwecanfindthenecessarydocumen-
tation, we show not only how a corporate debacle could have been foreseen
through application of basis analytical techniques but also how practicing
analysts actually did detect the problem before it became widely recognized.
Readers will be encouraged by these examples, we hope, to undertake gen-
uine, goal-oriented analysis, instead of simply going through the motions
of calculating standard financial ratios. Moreover, the case studies should
persuade them to stick to their guns when they spot trouble, despite man-
agement’s predictable litany. (“Our financial statements are consistent with
generally accepted accounting principles. They have been certified by one
of the world’s premier auditing firms. We will not allow a band of greedy
short sellers to destroy the value created by our outstanding employees.”)
Typically, as the vehemence of management’s protests increases, conditions
deteriorate further, culminating in revelations that suddenly wipe out sub-
stantial shareholder value.
As for the plan ofFinancial Statement Analysis, readers should not feel
compelled to tackle its chapters in the order we have assigned to them. To
aid those who want to jump in somewhere in the middle of the book, we
provide cross-referencing and a glossary. Words that are defined in the glos-

CHAPTER 1
The Adversarial Nature of
Financial Reporting
F
inancial statement analysis is an essential skill in a variety of occupations,
including investment management, corporate finance, commercial lend-
ing, and the extension of credit. For individuals engaged in such activities,
or who analyze financial data in connection with their personal investment
decisions, there are two distinct approaches to the task.
The first is to follow a prescribed routine, filling in boxes with standard
financial ratios, calculated according to precise and inflexible definitions. It
maytakealittlemoreeffortormentalexertionthanthistosatisfytheformal
requirementsofmanypositionsinthefieldoffinancialanalysis.Operatingin
apurelymechanicalmanner,though,willnotprovidemuchofaprofessional
challenge. Neither will a rote completion of all of the proper standard ana-
lytical steps ensure a useful, or even a nonharmful, result. Some individuals,
however, will view such problems as only minor drawbacks.
This book is aimed at the analyst who will adopt the second and more
rewarding alternative: the relentless pursuit of accurate financial profiles of
the entities being analyzed. Tenacity is essential because financial statements
oftenconcealmorethantheyreveal.Totheanalystwhoembracesthisproac-
tive approach, producing a standard spreadsheet on a company is a means
rather than an end. Investors derive but little satisfaction from the knowl-
edgethatanuntimelystockpurchaserecommendationwassupportedbythe
longest row of figures available in the software package. Genuinely valuable
analysis beginsafter all the usual questions have been answered. Indeed, a
superior analyst adds value by raising questions that are not even on the
checklist.
Some readers may not immediately concede the necessity of going
beyond an analytical structure that puts all companies on a uniform,
objective scale. They may recoil at the notion of discarding the struc-
ture altogether when a sound assessment depends on factors other than

comparisons of standard financial ratios. Comparability, after all, is a
cornerstone of generally accepted accounting principles(GAAP). It might
therefore seem to follow that financial statements prepared in accordance
with GAAP necessarily produce fair and useful indications of relative value.
The corporations that issue financial statements, moreover, would
appear to have a natural interest in facilitating convenient, cookie-cutter
analysis. These companies spend heavily to disseminate information about
their financial performance. They employ investor-relations managers, they
communicate with existing and potential shareholders via interim financial
reports and press releases, and their senior executives participate in lengthy
conference calls with securities analysts. Given that companies are so eager
to make their financial results known to investors, they should also want
it to be easy for analysts to monitor their progress. It follows that they can
be expected to report their results in a transparent and straightforward
fashion ... or so it would seem.
THE PURPOSE OF FINANCIAL REPORTING
Analysts who believe in the inherent reliability of GAAP numbers and the
good faith of corporate managers misunderstand the essential nature of
financial reporting. Their conceptual error connotes no lack of intelligence,
however.Rather,itmirrorsthestandardaccountingtextbook’sidealisticbut
irrelevant notion of the purpose of financial reporting. Even the renowned
consultant to investment managers and author Howard Schilit, an acerbic
criticoffinancialreportingasitisactuallypracticed,presentsahigh-minded
view of the matter:
The primary goal in financial reporting is the dissemination of
financial statements that accurately measure the profitability and
financial condition of a company.
1
Missing from this formulation is an indication ofwhose primary goal is
accurate measurement. Schilit’s words are music to the ears of the financial
statement users listed in this chapter’s first paragraph, but they are not the
ones doing the financial reporting. Rather, the issuers are for-profit compa-
nies, generally organized as corporations.
2
A corporation exists for the benefit of its shareholders. Its objective is
not to educate the public about its financial condition, but to maximize
its shareholders’ wealth. If it so happens that management can advance
thatobjectivethrough“disseminationoffinancialstatementsthataccurately
measure the profitability and financial condition of the company,” then in

principle, management should do so. At most, however, reporting financial
results in a transparent and straightforward fashion is a means unto an end.
Management may determine that a more direct method of maximiz-
ing shareholder wealth is to reduce the corporation’scost of capital.S i m p l y
stated, the lower the interest rate at which a corporation can borrow or the
higher the price at which it can sell stock to new investors, the greater the
wealth of its shareholders. From this standpoint, the best kind of financial
statement is not one that represents the corporation’s condition most fully
and most fairly, but rather one that produces the highest possible credit rat-
ing (see Chapter 13) and price-earningsmultiple (see Chapter 14). If the
highest ratings and multiples result from statements that measure profitabil-
ity and financial conditioninaccurately,the logic of fiduciary duty to share-
holders obliges management to publish that sort, rather than the type held
up as a model in accounting textbooks. The best possible outcome is a cost
of capital lower than the corporation deserves on its merits. This admittedly
perverse argument can be summarized in the following maxim, presented
from the perspective of issuers of financial statements:
The purpose of financial reporting is to obtain cheap capital.
Attentive readers will raise two immediate objections. First, they will
say, it is fraudulent to obtain capital at less than a fair rate by presenting
an unrealistically bright financial picture. Second, some readers will argue
that misleading the users of financial statements is not a sustainable strategy
over the long run. Stock market investors who rely on overstated histori-
cal profits to project a corporation’s future earnings will find that results
fail to meet their expectations. Thereafter, they will adjust for the upward
bias in the financial statements by projecting lower earnings than the histor-
ical results would otherwise justify. The outcome will be a stock valuation
no higher than accurate reporting would have produced. Recognizing that
the practice would be self-defeating, corporations will logically refrain from
overstatingtheirfinancialperformance.Bythisreasoning,theusersoffinan-
cialstatementscantakethenumbersatfacevalue,becausecorporationsthat
act in their self-interest will report their results honestly.
The inconvenient fact that confounds these arguments is that financial
statements do not invariably reflect their issuers’ performance faithfully.
In lieu of easily understandable and accurate data, users of financial state-
ments often find numbers that conform to GAAP yet convey a misleading
impression of profits. Worse yet, companies frequently bend and sometimes
break the rules for financial reporting. Not even the analyst’s second line of
defense, an affirmation by independent auditors that the statements have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP, assures that the numbers are

reliable. Reported numbers can be invalidated by subsequent revisions,
typically, if not always credibly, attributed to honest mistakes.
Alternatively, issuers may emphasize supplementary, non-GAAP num-
bers to steer analysts toward a more favorable view of their performance.
In fairness, some of the alternative metrics disseminated by issuers increase
the clarity of disclosure by addressing genuine shortcomings in the financial
reporting rules. The rule makers, after all, have found it challenging to keep
accountingstandardsuptodatewithchangesinthewaycorporationscreate
wealth. Those changes are a consequence of the shift in the economy from
traditional manufacturing to knowledge-based industries. At the same time,
the lack of standardization in non-GAAP reporting enables issuers that are
so inclined to exaggerate their financial performance.
The following case study demonstrates how an overly trusting user of
financial statements can be misled.
Mattel’s Accounting Games
On August 2, 2019, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Mattel’s outside audi-
tor, received a whistleblower letter suggesting that accounting errors had
occurred in earlier periods and questioning whether PwC was truly inde-
pendent. The toymaker disclosed the letter’s receipt on August 8, 2019, and
the following day its stock plunged by 15.8 percent while the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index registered a minor decline of 0.7 percent. Mattel’s board
directed the audit committee to investigate the matter.
The investigation found that income tax expense was understated by
$109 million in 2017’s third quarter and overstated by the same amount
in the fourth quarter, resulting in no impact for the full year. Disclosing
these findings on October 29, 2019, Mattel pointed out that the errors were

The Adversarial Nature of Financial Reporting 7
Mattel’s audit committee determined that many of the whistleblower’s
allegationsaboutPwC’sindependencewereunfounded.Inconjunctionwith
a separate investigation by PwC, however, the audit committee concluded
that the lead audit partner for Mattel violated Securities and Exchange
Commission rules on auditor independence by recommending candidates
forthecompany’s seniorfinance positionsandproviding feedback onsenior
finance employees. PwC replaced some members of the audit team assigned
to Mattel, including the lead partner, who was placed on administrative
leave. (One commentator on accounting issues characterized him as the fall
guy in the affair.)

The bland tone of Mattel’s disclosure likely reassured investors whose
confidence in the company’s financial reporting had been shaken by the
August 8 revelations. In the following month, however, theWall Street
Journal presented details5 of what happened when Mattel’s tax team
discovered the accounting error in early 2018, several months before the
news reached the audit committee.
Brett Whitaker, who was director of tax reporting at the time, said the
company’s finance team discussed correcting the error and restating earn-
ings, expecting that Mattel would have to come clean about flaws in its
accountingprocedures.AccordingtoWhitakeranddocumentsthatthe Wall
Street Journalreviewed,seniorcompanyfinanceexecutivesandPwCdecided
instead to change the accounting treatment of theThomas & Friendscar-
toon series, starring a talking locomotive. That action effectively buried the
problem.
Whitaker, who stated that he was not the whistleblower, characterized
the senior executives’ response as a coverup and said it dumbfounded his
team. He reported that one of PWC’s tax partners was high-fiving people
in the hallway after the decision was made to change the accounting, reliev-
ing the auditing firm of the need to admit its error. Whitaker resigned from
MattelinMarch2018.Mattel,foritspart,replaceditschieffinancialofficer
but said the change in accounting treatment was appropriate.
Following this blow to its credibility with investors, one might have
expected a chastened Mattel to be on its best behavior with respect to
financial reporting. Only a year-and-a-half after the public learned of
the accounting error in the 2017 statements, however, the Securities and
Exchange Commission ordered the company to stop using a non-GAAP
measure it employed in the discussion and analysis section of its 2019 finan-
cial statement. “Gross sales” excluded adjustments such as trade discounts.
Mattel applied it to overall revenue as well as its “power brands,” namely,
Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher Price – and Thomas the Tank Engine and his
pals. Mattel agreed to switch to “gross billings,” the amounts invoiced to
customers.

The context of these events is instructive for users of financial state-
ments. Mattel’s share price fell by 50.2 percent between year-ends 2014 and
2017. In 2018 Mattel lost $531 million on sales of $4.5 million. The com-
pany was plagued by declining sales, particularly in the Fisher-Price and
American Girl Lines. In addition, Mattel recalled all 4.7 million Rock ‘n’
Play Sleeper products after the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission
reported that they were associated with more than 30 infant deaths since
their 2009 introduction. (The company said it was not at fault and that the
fatalities resulted from customers disregarding safety warnings and instruc-
tions.)Seasonedobserversoffinancialreportingnoticethaterrorsfrequently

Mattel’sstoryisjustoneofmanyinthisbookthatshoulddispelanyillu-
sions that financial statements are always completely reliable. The outside
auditor’s stamp of approval is no guarantee that reported earnings accu-
rately reflect actual results. Auditing firms, no less than corporate issuers of
financial statements, are for-profit businesses with incentives to sweep their
failings under the rug. Users of the statements must employ the best analyt-
ical techniques available to identify signs that the reported numbers are out
of line with the company’s true performance or financial condition.

As many examples that follow demonstrate, neither fear of antifraud
statutes nor enlightened self-interest invariably deters corporations from
cooking the books. The reasoning by which these two forces ensure honest
accountingrestsonhiddenassumptions.Noneoftheassumptionscanstand
up to an examination of the organizational context in which financial
reporting occurs.
To begin with, corporations can push the numbers pretty far out of
joint before they run afoul of the accounting standards, much less open
themselves to prosecution for fraud. When deliberate financial reporting
violations come to light, as in most other kinds of white-collar crime, the
real scandal involves what isnot forbidden. In practice, generally accepted
accounting principles countenance a lot of measurement that is decidedly
inaccurate, at least over the short run.

their auditors, because the appearance of smooth growth receives a higher
price-earnings multiple from stock market investors than the jagged reality
underlyingthenumbers.
Suppose that, in the last few weeks of a quarter, earnings threaten to
fall short of the programmed year-over-year increase. The corporation sim-
ply borrows sales (and associated profits) from the next quarter by offering
customers special discounts to place orders earlier than they had planned.
Higher-than-trendline growth, too, is a problem for the earnings-smoother.
A sudden jump in profits, followed by a return to a more ordinary rate of
growth, produces volatility, which is regarded as an evil to be avoided at all
costs. Management’s solution is to run up expenses in the current period by
scheduling training programs and plant maintenance that, while necessary,
would ordinarily be undertaken in a later quarter.
These are not tactics employed exclusively by fly-by-night companies.
Blue chip corporations openly acknowledge that they have little choice but
tosmooththeirearnings,givenWallStreet’sallergytosurprises.Inpastyears
officials of General Electric indicated that when a division was in danger of
failing to meet its annual earnings goal, it was accepted procedure to make
an acquisition in the waning days of the reporting period. According to an
executive in the company’s financial services business, he and his colleagues
hunt for acquisitions at such times, saying, “Gee, does somebody else have
someincome?Istheresomeotherdealwecanmake?”
6 Thefreshlyacquired
unit’s profits for the full quarter could be incorporated into GE’s, helping to
ensure the steady growth so prized by investors.
Why do auditors not forbid such gimmicks? They hardly seem consis-
tent with the ostensible purpose of financial reporting, namely, the accurate
portrayal of a corporation’s earnings. The explanation is that sound prin-
ciples of accounting theory represent only one ingredient in the stew from
which financial reporting standards emerge.

statements also have representation on theFinancial Accounting Standards

were ever to get sufficiently riled up, they might drastically curtail FASB’s
authority. Under extreme circumstances, they might even replace FASB with
a new rule-making body that the corporations could more easily bend to
their will.
Thereisanotherreasonthatenlightenedself-interestdoesnotinvariably
drive corporations toward candid financial reporting. The corporate execu-
tives who lead the battles against FASB have their own agenda. Just like the
investors who buy their corporations’ stock, managers seek to maximize
their wealth. If producing bona fide economic profits advances that objec-
tive, it is rational for a chief executive officer (CEO) to try to do so. In some
cases, though, the CEO can achieve greater personal gain by taking advan-
tage of the compensation system through financial reporting gimmicks.
Suppose, for example, the CEO’s year-end bonus is based on growth in
earnings per share. Assume also that for financial reporting purposes, the
corporation’s depreciation schedules assume an average life of eight years
for fixed assets. By arbitrarily amending that assumption to nine years (and
obtaining the auditors’ consent to the change), the corporation can lower
its annual depreciation expense. This is strictly an accounting change; the
actualcostofreplacingequipmentworndownthroughusedoesnotdecline.
Neither does the corporation’s tax deduction for depreciation expense rise
nor, as a consequence, does cash flow

that bona fide profits (see Chapter 5) have not increased, so the corpora-
tion’s stock price does not change in response to the new accounting policy.

This example explains why a corporation may alter itsaccounting prac-
tices, making it harder for investors to track its performance, even though
the shareholders’ enlightened self-interest favors straightforward, transpar-

The logical solution for corporations, it would seem, is to align the
interests of management and shareholders. Instead of calculating executive
bonuses on the basis of earnings per share, the board should reward senior
management for increasing shareholders’ wealth by causing the stock price
to rise. Such an arrangement gives the CEO no incentive to inflate reported
earnings through gimmicks that transparently produce no increase in bona
fide profits and therefore no rise in the share price.
Following the logic through, financial reporting ought to have moved
closer to the ideal of accurate representation of corporate performance as

such trend was discernible. If anything, corporations became more creative

side. Corporate executives could no longer increase their bonuses through
financial reporting tricks that were readily detectable by investors. Instead,
they had to devise better-hidden gambits that fooled the market and arti-
ficially elevated the stock price. Financial statement analysts had to work
harder than ever to spot corporations’ subterfuges.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 raised hopes that analysts’ lives would
bemadeeasierbyenablingthemtorelymoreheavilyontheveracityofpub-
lished financial statements. Enacted in the wake of a series of spectacular
financial reporting scandals, the legislation required publicly traded compa-
nies’ chief executive officers and chief financial officers to issue statements
certifying that in all material respects their financial statements and disclo-
sures present their companies’ operations and financial condition fairly.
Spectacular financial reporting frauds did become less frequent as chief
executive officers began to face the prospect of prison time if they signed off
on fraudulent financial states. Fraud did not completely disappear, however.
To an extent, CEOs were able to push responsibility for it down the
chain of command by structuring their sign-offs on the statements as
approvalsofcalculationsbysubordinates,makingitdifficultforprosecutors
to secure convictions at the top level.
Although spectacular cases of outright fraud became less frequent
after Sarbanes-Oxley went into effect, analysts needed to remain vigilant.
As GAAP numbers became riskier, companies stepped up their efforts to
redirect analysts’ attention to non-GAAP, adjusted metrics that portrayed
them in a better light. Not incidentally, many companies used the adjusted –
that is, higher – earnings numbers in calculating CEOs’ bonuses.
Some of the adjusted revenue and earnings figures served constructive
purposes. By 2015, however, 90 percent of S&P 500 companies were
reporting non-GAAP, up from about 70 percent in 2009. At that point, the
Securities and Exchange Commission felt obliged to curb the trend.
TheSECcrackeddownonexcessiveuseofnonstandardaccountingmet-
rics in 2016. Under the new guidelines, companies could supplement their
reporting with on-GAAP numbers but had to give GAAP numbers equal or
greater prominence and explain how the two different sets of figures were
reconciled. The SEC crackdown had some initial impact, but financial state-
ment issuers resumed their eager embrace of non-GAAP numbers when the
COVID-19 pandemic hit.

SMALL PROFITS AND BIG BATHS
Certainly, financial statement analysts do not have to fight the battle
single-handedly. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Finan-
cial Accounting Standards Board prohibit corporations from going too far
in prettifying their profits to pump up their share prices. These regulators
refrain from indicating exactly how far is too far, however. Inevitably,
corporations hold diverse opinions on matters such as the extent to which
they must divulge bad news that might harm their stock market valuations.
For some, the standard of disclosure appears to be that if nobody happens
to ask about a specific event, then declining to volunteer the information
does not constitute a lie.
The picture is not quite that bleak in every case, but the bleakness
extends pretty far. A research team led by Harvard economist Richard
Zeckhauser compiled evidence that lack of perfect candor is widespread.
10
The researchers focused on instances in which a corporation reported
quarterly earnings that were only slightly higher or slightly lower than its
earnings in the corresponding quarter of the preceding year.
Suppose that corporate financial reporting followed the accountants’
idealizedobjectiveofdepictingperformanceaccurately.Bythelawsofprob-
ability, corporations’ quarterly reports would have included about as many
casesofearningsthatbarelyexceededyear-earlierresultsascasesofearnings
that fell just shy of year-earlier profits. Instead, Zeckhauser and colleagues
foundthatcorporationspostedsmallincreasesfarmorefrequentlythanthey
postedsmalldeclines.Thestrongimplicationwasthatwhencompanieswere
in danger of showing slightly negative earnings comparisons, they found
enough discretionary items to squeeze out marginally improved results.
On the other hand, suppose a corporation suffers a quarterly profit
decline too large to erase through discretionary items. Such circumstances

create an incentive to take a big bath by maximizing the reported setback.
Thereasoningisthatinvestorswillnotbemuchmoredisturbedbya30per-
cent drop in earnings than by a 20 percent drop. Therefore, management
may find it expedient toaccelerate certain future expenses into the current
quarter, thereby ensuring positive reported earnings in the following period.
It may also be a convenient time to recognize long-run losses in the value
of assets such as outmoded production facilities andgoodwill created in
unsuccessful acquisitions of the past. In fact, the corporation may take a
larger write-off on those assets than the principle of accurate representation
would dictate. Reversals of the excess write-offs offer an artificial means of
stabilizing reported earnings in subsequent periods.
Zeckhauser and his associates corroborated the big bath hypothesis
by showing that large earnings declines were more common than large
increases. By implication, managers did not passively record the combined
results of their own skill and business factors beyond their control, but
intervened in the calculation of earnings by exploiting the latitude in
accounting rules. The researchers’ overall impression was that corporations
regard financial reporting as a technique for propping up stock prices,
rather than a means of disseminating objective information.
11
If corporations’ gambits escape detection by investors and lenders, the
rewards can be vast. For example, an interest-cost savings of half a percent-
age point on $10 billion of borrowings equates to $50 million (pretax) per
year. If the corporation is in a 21 percent tax bracket and its stock trades
at 20 times earnings, the payoff for risk-concealing financial statements is
$790 million in the cumulative value of its shares.
Amongthepopularmethodsforpursuingsuchopportunitiesforwealth
enhancement, aside from the big bath technique studied by Zeckhauser, are:
■ Maximizing growth expectations.
■ Downplaying contingencies.
MAXIMIZING GROWTH EXPECTATIONS
Imagine a corporation that is currently reporting annual net earnings of
$200 million. Assume that five years from now, when its growth has leveled
off somewhat, the corporation will be valued at 20 times earnings. Further
assume that the company will pay no dividends over the next five years and
that investors in growth stocks currently seek returns of 25 percent (before
considering capital gains taxes).
Basedontheseassumptions,plusoneadditionalnumber,theanalystcan
place an aggregate value on the corporation’s outstanding shares. The final

required input is the expected growth rate of earnings. Suppose the corpo-
ration’s earnings have been growing at a 30 percent annual rate and appear
likely to continue increasing at the same rate over the next five years. At the
end of that period, annual earnings will be $743 million. Applying a mul-
tiple of 20 times to that figure produces a valuation at the end of the fifth
year of $14.9 billion. Investors seeking a 25 percent rate of return will pay
$4.9 billion today for that future value.
These figures are likely to be pleasing to a founder or chief executive
officer who owns, for the sake of illustration, 25 percent of the outstanding
shares. The successful entrepreneur is worth $1.2 billion on paper, quite
possibly up from zero just a few years ago. At the same time, the newly
minted billionaire is a captive of the market’s expectations.
Suppose investors conclude for some reason that the corporation’s
potential for increasing its earnings has declined from 30 to 25 percent per
annum. That is still far above average for corporate America. Nevertheless,
the aggregate value of the corporation’s shares will decline from $4.9 billion
to $4.8 billion, keeping previous assumptions intact.
Overnight, the long-struggling founder will see the value of his personal
stakeplummetby$25million.Financialanalystsmayshedfewtearsforhim.
After all, he is still a billionaire on paper. If they were in his shoes, however,
how many would accept a $25 million loss with perfect equanimity? Most
would be sorely tempted, at the least, to avoid incurring a financial reverse
of comparable magnitude via every means available to them under GAAP.
That all-too-human response is the one typically exhibited by owner-
managersconfrontedwithfallinggrowthexpectations.Many,perhapsmost,
have no intention to deceive. It is simply that the entrepreneur is by nature
a self-assured optimist. A successful entrepreneur, moreover, has had this
optimism vindicated. Having taken his company from nothing to $200 mil-
lionofearningsagainstoverwhelmingodds,hebelieveshecanlickwhatever

back onto a 30 percent growth curve, and perhaps he is right. One thing is
certain:Ifhewerenotthesortwhobelievedhecouldbeattheoddsonemore
time, he would never have built a company worth almost $5 billion.
Financial analysts need to assess the facts more objectively. They must
recognize that the corporation’s predicament is not unique, but on the con-
trary, quite common. Almost invariably, senior managers try to dispel the
impression of decelerating growth, since that perception can be so costly to
them. Simple mathematics, however, tends to make false prophets of cor-
porations that extrapolate high growth rates indefinitely into the future.
Moreover, once growth begins to level off (see Exhibit 1.1), restoring it to
the historical rate requires overcoming several powerful limitations.

If growth continues at the same rate, however, the corporation will have to
generate 59 million new unit sales to achieve a 40 percent gain in Year 10.
In absolute terms, it is arithmetically possible for volume to increase
indefinitely. On the other hand, a growth rate far in excess of thegross
domestic product’s annual increase is nearly impossible to sustain over any
extended period. By definition, a product that experiences higher-than-GDP
growth captures a larger percentage of GDP each year. As the numbers get
larger, it becomes increasingly difficult to switch consumers’ spending pat-
terns to accommodate continued high growth of a particular product.
Market Share Constraints For a time, a corporation may overcome the limits
ofgrowthinitsmarketandtheeconomyasawholebyexpandingitssalesat
the expense of competitors. Even when growth is achieved by market share
gains rather than by expanding the overall demand for a product, however,
the firm must eventually bump up against a ceiling on further growth at a
constant rate. For example, suppose a producer with a 10 percent share
of market is currently growing at 25 percent a year while total demand
for the product is expanding at only 5 percent annually. By Year 14, this
supergrowth company will require a 115 percent market share to maintain
its rate of increase. (Long before confronting this mathematical impossi-
bility, the corporation’s growth will probably be curtailed by the antitrust
authorities.)
Basic economics and compound-interest tables, then, assure the analyst
that all growth stories come to an end, a cruel fate that must eventually be

Between 2010 and 2015 Under Armour’s stock rose at an astounding
compound annual growth rateof 42.5 percent. The manufacturer of sports
and fitness apparel, shoes, and accessories was in the midst of a 26-quarter
streak of 20 percent or greater year-over-year sales increases. Over the next
year-and-a-half, however, Under Armour’s shares plunged by nearly 50 per-
cent even as the Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index advanced by almost
20 percent.

The plummeting share price reflected a blow to high expectations for
sales and earnings growth that investors had built into Under Armour’s
valuation. Even after management reported a deceleration in sales growth
to 12 percent in 2016’s fourth quarter, its stock remained at a lofty price-
earnings multiple of 44 times. Among other setbacks, the company’s sales
were hit by a succession of bankruptcies at sporting goods retailing chains.
Concurrent with the slowdown in sales growth, Under Armour’s gross

sorship and marketing.
The stock of another high-flier, Boston Beer, rose at a 26 percent com-
pound annual rate in the 15 years through 2014. Over the next two years
shareholders suffered a 41 percent decline. The S&P 500 rose by 9 percent
during that span. Once again, the culprit was slowing revenue. In 2016 the
brewer of Samuel Adams Lager posted its first year-over-year sales decline
in 13 years, as well as a 6 percent drop in earnings per share.
“The problem for Boston Beer,” wrote Avi Salzman inBarron’s, is that
craft beer appears to have reached the saturation point. Everybody and his
brother now has a special brew with a cool label and a hint of cocoa.”
12
In 1984, when Boston Beer was founded, the U.S. had just 97 breweries.
By 2016 the number was 5,000, which included a doubling just since 2012,
according to Brewers Association chief economist Bart Watson.
All that proliferation of brands may have been overwhelming beer
drinkers with choices. Boston Beer’s founder and chairman Jim Koch
reported that some retailers were confused. Consumers were giving up
on trying to choose a craft beer and just saying, “I’ll have a Corona.”
13
Compounding the problem, industry giants Anheuser-Busch InBev and
MillersCoors were acquiring many craft brewers, making craft beer seem
less special.
As withUnder Armour, maintaining sales growth was expected tocome

Finally, Whole Foods Market far outpaced the S&P 500 with an 18
percent compound annual rise in its share price from 2003 to 2013. The
stock index rose at just 5 percent a year during the period. Between 2013
and 2016, however, the organic food retailer’s stock dropped by 47 percent
versus a 21 percent gain for the S&P 500.

As with the previous examples, competition put a crimp in investors’
dreams of continued high, steady sales growth. Co-founder and chief exec-
utive officer John Mackey acknowledged a similar complacency within the
company, saying, “When you average 8 percent same-store sales [growth]
for 35 years, it can breed a sense of ‘Why do we need to change? Things are
working.’”
14 Then reality stepped in.
For years, Whole Foods had a lock on the natural and organic sector,
enabling it to charge high prices while spending little on promotion. Then
other supermarket chains got into the game, offering similar products at
lower prices. “More conventional supermarkets are copying us,” Mackey
lamented. “Every place we went bred the Midas touch. But it also bred
envy.”
15 By 2016, Kroger’s natural and organic sales exceeded Whole
Foods’s total revenue. The warehouse-club retailer Costco Wholesale
claimed honors as the top organic food retailer.
To analysts who had absorbed the lessons of countess precedents, the
results should not have been surprising. Whole Foods racked up six quar-
ters of same-store sales declines, its longest such streak since going public
in 1992. Over that span, customer visits fell by as much as 14 million,
according to Barclays PLC. In June 2017, with activist investors pressur-
ing management to rebuild shareholder value, Whole Foods agreed to be
acquired by online retailing giant Amazon.
Commonly Heard Rationalizations for Declining Growth
“Our Year-over-Year Comparisons Were Distorted” Recognizing the sensitivity
of investors to any slowdown in growth, companies faced with earnings
deceleration commonly resort to certain standard arguments to persuade
investors that the true, underlying profit trend is still rising at its historical
rate (see Exhibit 1.2). Freak weather conditions may be blamed for suppos-
edly anomalous, below-trendline earnings. Alternatively, the company may
allegethatshipmentsweredelayed (never canceled, merelydelayed) because
of temporary production problems caused, ironically, by the company’s
explosive growth. (What appeared to be a negative for the stock price,
in other words, was actually a positive. Orders were coming in faster
than the company could fill them – a high-class problem indeed.) Widely
publicized macroeconomic events such as the Y2K problem
16 receive more
than their fair share of blame for earnings shortfalls. However plausible
these explanations may sound, analysts should remember that in many past
instances, short-term supposed aberrations have turned out to be advance
signals of earnings slowdowns.

gies worked better on paper than in practice. One problem was that they
had to pay extremely high price-earnings multiples for growth companies
that other conglomerates also coveted. Unless earnings growth accelerated
dramatically under the new corporate ownership, the acquirer’s return on
investment was fated to be mediocre. This constraint was especially prob-
lematic for managers who had no particular expertise in the businesses they
were acquiring. Still worse was the predicament of a corporation that paid
a big premium for an also-ran in a hot industry. Regrettably, the number of
industry leaders available for acquisition was by definition limited.
By the 1980s, the stock market had rendered its verdict. The
price-earnings multiples of widely diversified corporations carried a
conglomerate discount. One practical problem was the difficulty security
analysts encountered in trying to keep tabs on companies straddling many
different industries. Instead of making 2 plus 2 equal 5, as they had
promised, the conglomerates’ managers presided over corporate empires
that traded at cheaper prices than their constituent companies would have
sold for in aggregate had they been listed separately.

DOWNPLAYING CONTINGENCIES
A second way to mold disclosure to suit the issuer’s interests is by down-
playing extremely significant contingent liabilities. Thanks to the advent
of class-action suits, the entire net worth of even a multibillion-dollar

corporation may be at risk in litigation involving environmental hazards or
product liability. Understandably, an issuer of financial statements would
prefer that securities analysts focus their attention elsewhere.
At one time, analysts tended to shunt aside claims that ostensibly
threatened major corporations with bankruptcy. They observed that mas-
sive lawsuits were often settled for small fractions of the original claims.
Furthermore, the outcome of a lawsuit often hinged on facts that emerged
only when the case finally came to trial (which by definition never happened
if the suit was settled out of court). Considering also the susceptibility
of juries to emotional appeals, securities analysts of bygone days found
it extremely difficult to incorporate legal risks into earnings forecasts
that relied primarily onmicroeconomic and macroeconomic variables. At
most, a contingency that had the potential of wiping out a corporation’s
equity became a qualitative factor in determining the multiple assigned to a
company’s earnings.
Manville Corporation’s 1982 bankruptcy marked a watershed in the
way analysts have viewed legal contingencies. To their credit, specialists
in the building products sector had been asking detailed questions about
Manville’s exposure to asbestos-related personal injury suits for a long time
before the company filed. Many investors nevertheless seemed to regard the
corporation’s August 26, 1982, filing underChapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code as a sudden calamity. Manville’s stock plunged by 35 percent on the
day following its filing.
In part, the surprise element was a function of disclosure. The corpo-
ration’s last quarterly report to the Securities and Exchange Commission
prior to its bankruptcy had implied a total cost of settling asbestos-related
claims of about $350 million. That was less than half of Manville’s $830
million of shareholders’ equity. On August 26, by contrast, Manville
estimated the potential damages at no less than $2 billion.
For analysts of financial statements, the Manville episode demon-
strated the plausibility of a scenario previously thought inconceivable.
A bankruptcy at an otherwise financially sound company, brought on
solely by legal claims, had become a nightmarish reality. Intensifying the
shock was that the problem had lain dormant for many years. Manville’s
bankruptcy resulted from claims for diseases contracted decades earlier
through contact with the company’s products. The long-tailed nature of
asbestos liabilities was underscored by a series of bankruptcy filings over
succeeding years. Prominent examples, each involving a billion dollars or
moreofassets,includedWalterIndustries(1989),NationalGypsum(1990),
USG Corporation (1993 and again in 2001), Owens Corning (2000), and
Armstrong World Industries (2000).

Massive awards to litigants do not invariably trigger corporate
bankruptcies. In 2016 a federal judge approved a $20 billion settlement
of civil claims against U.K.-based integrate oil giant BP arising from the
largest marine oil spill in history. Also in that year, a federal judge approved
a $14.7 billion settlement in litigation concerning Volkswagen’s scheme to
cheat on emission test of diesel cars. Neither company went bust as a result,
but the events underscore the magnitude of potential losses that could
blindside analysts who ordinarily focus on the potential impact of much
more minor earnings surprises.
Bankruptcies connected with asbestos exposure, silicone gel breast
implants, and assorted environmental hazards have heightened awareness
of legal risks. Even so, analysts still miss the forest for the trees in some
instances, concentrating on the minutiae of financial ratios of corporations
facing similarly large contingent liabilities. They can still be lulled by
companies’ matter-of-fact responses to questions about the gigantic claims
asserted against them.
Thinking about it from the issuer’s standpoint, one can imagine sev-
eral reasons that the investor-relations officer’s account of a major legal
contingency is likely to be rosier than the economic reality. To begin with,
the corporation’s managers have a clear interest in downplaying risks that
threaten the value of their stock and options. Furthermore, as parties to a
highly contentious lawsuit, the executives find themselves in a conflict. It
would be difficult for them to testify persuasively in their company’s defense
while simultaneously acknowledging to investors that the plaintiffs’ claims
have merit and might, in fact, prevail. (Indeed, any such public admission
could compromise the corporation’s case. Candid disclosure may therefore
not be a viable option.) Finally, it would hardly represent aberrant behavior
if, on a subconscious level, management were to deny the real possibility of
acompany-wrecking judgment. Itmustbepsychologically difficultforman-
agers to acknowledge that their company could go bust for reasons seem-
ingly outside their control. Filing for bankruptcy may prove to be the only
course available to the corporation, notwithstanding an excellent record of
earnings growth and a conservative balance sheet.
For all these reasons, analysts must take particular care to rely on their
independent judgment when a potentially devastating contingent liability
looms larger than their conscientiously calculated financial ratios. It is not
a matter of sitting in judgment on management’s honor and forthrightness.
If corporate executives remain in denial about the magnitude of the prob-
lem, they are not deliberately misleading analysts by presenting an overly
optimisticpicture.Moreover,themanagersmaynotprovideareliableassess-

little basis for estimating the likelihood that the worst-case scenario will be
fulfilled. Analysts who have seen other corporations in similar predicaments
have more perspective on the matter, as well as greater objectivity. Instead

agement’s assertions that the liability claims will never stand up in court.
THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING SKEPTICAL
By now, the reader presumably understands why this chapter is titled “The
Adversarial Nature of Financial Reporting.” The issuer of financial state-
ments has been portrayed in an unflattering light, invariably choosing the
accounting option that will tend to prop up its stock price, rather than gen-
erously assisting the analyst in deriving an accurate picture of its financial
condition. Analysts have been warned not to partake of the optimism that
drives all great business enterprises, but instead to maintain an attitude of
skepticism bordering on distrust. Some readers may feel they are not cut out
to be financial analysts if the job consists of constant nay-saying, of posing
embarrassing questions, and of being a perennial thorn in the side of com-
panies that want to win friends among investors, customers, and suppliers.
Although pursuing relentless antagonism can indeed be an unpleasant
waytogothroughlife,thestancethatthisbookrecommendstowardissuers
of financial statements implies no such acrimony. Rather, analysts should
view the issuers as adversaries in the same manner that they temporarily
demonize their opponents in a friendly pickup basketball game. On the
court,thecompetitioncanbeintense,whichonlyaddstothefun.Afterward,
everyonecanhaveafinetimegoingouttogetherforpizzaandbeer.Inshort,
financialanalystsandinvestor-relationsofficerscanviewtheirworkwiththe
detachment of litigators who engage in every legal form of shin-kicking out
of sheer desire to win the case, not because the litigants’ claims necessarily
have intrinsic merit.
Too often, financial writers describe the give-and-take of financial
reporting and analysis in a highly moralistic tone. Typically, the author
exposes a tricky presentation of the numbers and reproaches the company
for greed and chicanery. Viewing the production of financial statements as
an epic struggle between good and evil may suit a crusading journalist, but
financial analysts need not join the ethics police to do their job well.
An alternative is to learn to understand the gamesmanship of financial
reporting, perhaps even to appreciate on some level the cleverness of issuers
who constantly devise new stratagems for leading investors off the track.

Outright fraud cannot be countenanced, but disclosure that shades eco-
nomic realities without violating the law requires truly impressive ingenuity.
By regarding the interaction between issuers and users of financial state-
ments as a game, rather than a morality play, analysts will find it easier to
view the action from the opposite side. Just as a chess master anticipates
an opponent’s future moves, analysts should consider which gambits they
themselves would use if they were in the issuer’s seat.

Now I have to engage in role-playing exercises to guess what tricks will be
embedded in the statements before they even come out. I thought this book
was supposed to make my job easier, not more complicated.”
In reality, this book’s goal is to make the reader a better analyst. If that
goal could be achieved by providing shortcuts, the authors would not hes-
itate to do so. Financial reporting occurs in an institutional context that
obliges conscientious analysts to go many steps beyond conventional cal-
culation of financial ratios. Without the extra vigilance advocated in these
pages, the user of financial statements will become mired in a system that
provides excessively simple answers to complex questions, squelches indi-
viduals who insolently refuse to accept reported financial data at face value,
and inadvisably gives issuers the benefit of the doubt.
These systematic biases are inherent in selling stocks. Within the
universe of investors are many large, sophisticated financial institutions
that utilize the best available techniques of analysis to select securities for
their portfolios. Also among the buyers of stocks are individuals who,
not being trained in financial statement analysis, are poorly equipped to
evaluate annual and quarterly earnings reports. Both types of investors are
important sources of financing for industry, and both benefit over the long
term from the returns that accrue to capital in a market economy. The two
groups cannot be sold stocks in the same way, however.
What generally sells best to individual investors is a story. Sometimes
the story involves a new product with seemingly unlimited sales potential.

No great harm is done when an analyst’s stock purchase recommen-

the story is disseminated may depend more on its narrative appeal than
on the solidity of the supporting analysis.

Point A, where half of all applicants are approved and half are refused, rep-
resents an unnecessarily high credit standard. Any company employing it
would turn away many potential customers who posed almost no threat of
delinquency. Even Cutoff Point B, which allows more business to be writ-
ten but produces no credit losses, is less than optimal. Credit managers who
seek to maximize profits aim for Cutoff Point C. It represents a level of
credit extension at which losses on receivables occur but are slightly more
than offset by the profits derived from incremental customers.

To achieve this optimal result, a credit analyst must approve a certain
number of accounts that will eventually fail to pay. In effect, the analyst
is required to make mistakes that could be avoided by rigorously obeying
the conclusions derived from the study of applicants’ financial statements.
Thecompanymakesupthecostofsuchmistakesbyavoidingmistakesofthe
opposite type (rejecting potential customers who will not fail to pay).
Trading off one type of error for another is thoroughly rational and
consistent with sound analysis, so long as the objective is truly to maximize
profits. There is always a danger, however, that the company will instead
maximize sales at the expense of profits. That is, the credit manager may
bias the system even further, to Cutoff Point D in Exhibit 1.3. Such a prob-
lem is bound to arise if the company’s salespeople are paid on commission
and their compensation is not tightly linked to the collection experience of
their customers. The rational response to that sort of incentive system is to
pressurecreditanalyststoapproveapplicantswhosefinancialstatementscry
out for rejection.
A similar tension between the desire to book revenues and the need to
make sound credit decisions exists in commercial lending. At a bank or a
finance company, an analyst of financial statements may be confronted by
special pleading on behalf of a loyal, long-established client that is under
allegedly temporary strain. Alternatively, the lending officer may argue that

Every high-risk company seeking a loan can make a plausible soft case

venturesforwhichtherewasscarcelyanyfinancialdatafromwhichtocalcu-
late ratios. The rationale advanced for lending to these nascent companies
was the supposedly limitless demand for services made possible by mirac-
ulous new technology. Credit analysis gone awry was at the core of the
Great Recession of 2008–2009. An unsustainable boom in housing prices
was fueled by mortgages lending that abandoned all established standards
for qualifying borrowers.
To be sure, defaults also occur among individuals and companies that
satisfy established quantitative standards. When it comes to quantitative
standards, though, analysts can test financial ratios against a historical
record to determine their reliability as predictors of bankruptcy (see
Chapter 13). No comparable testing is feasible for the highly idiosyncratic,
qualitativefactorsthatweaklycapitalizedcompanies citewhenapplyingfor
loans. Analysts are therefore on more solid ground when they rely primarily
on the numbers than when they try to discriminate among companies’ soft
arguments.
CONCLUSION
A primary objective of this chapter has been to supply an essential ingre-
dient that is missing from many discussions of financial statement analysis.
Aside from accounting rules, cash flows, and definitions of standard ratios,
analysts must consider the motivations of corporate managers, as well as
the dynamics of the organizations in which they work. Neglecting these fac-
tors will lead to false assumptions about the underlying intent of issuers’
communications with users of financial statements.
Moreover, analysts may make incorrect inferences about the quality of
their own work if they fail to understand the workings of their own organi-
zations. If a conclusion derived from thorough financial analysis is deemed
wrong,itisimportanttoknowwhetherthatjudgmentreflectsaflawedanal-
ysisorahigher-leveldecisiontooverrideanalysts’recommendations.Senior
managers sometimes subordinate financial statement analysis to a determi-
nation that idle funds must be put to work or that loan volume must be
increased. At such times, organizations rationalize their behavior by per-
suading themselves that the principles of interpreting financial statements
have fundamentally changed. Analysts need not go to the extreme of resign-
ing in protest, but they will benefit if they can avoid getting caught up in the
prevailing delusion.

Using this more sophisticated model, an analyst can unravel an oth-
erwise vexing riddle concerning corporate reporting. Overstating earnings
would appear to be a self-defeating strategy in the long term, since it has a
tendency to catch up with the perpetrator. Suppose, for example, a corpora-
tion depreciates assets over a longer period than can be justified by physical
wear and tear and the rate of technological change in manufacturing meth-
ods.Whenthetimecomestoreplacetheexistingequipment,thecorporation
will face two unattractive options. The first is to penalize reported earn-
ings by writing off the remaining undepreciated balance on equipment that
is obsolete and hence of little value in the resale market. Alternatively, the
company can delay the necessary purchase of more up-to-date equipment,
thereby losing ground competitively and reducing future earnings. Would
the corporation not have been better off if it had refrained from overstating
its earnings in the first place, an act that probably cost it some measure of
credibility among investors?
Iftheanalystconsidersthematterfromthestandpointofmanagement,a
possible solution to the riddle emerges. The day of reckoning, when the firm
must pay back the reported earnings borrowed via underdepreciation, may
be beyond the planning horizon of senior management. A chief executive
officerwhointendstoretireinfiveyears,andwhowillbecompensatedinthe

no qualms about exaggerating current results at the expense of future years’
operations.Thelong-terminterestsofthefirm’sowners,inotherwords,may
not be consistent with the short-term interests of their agents, the salaried
managers.
Plainly, analysts cannot be expected to read minds or to divine the true
motives of management in every case. There is a benefit, however, in simply
being cognizant of objectives other than the ones presupposed by introduc-
tory accounting texts. If nothing else, the awareness that management may
have something up its sleeve will encourage readers to trust their instincts
when some aspect of a company’s disclosure simply does not ring true. In
a given instance, management may judge that its best chance of minimizing
analysts’ criticism of an obviously disastrous corporate decision lies in stub-
bornly defending the decision and refusing to change course. Even though
thechiefexecutiveofficermaybeabletopullitoffwithastraightface,how-
ever, the blunder remains a blunder. Analysts who remember that managers

may be pursuing their own agendas will be ahead of the game. They will
be properly skeptical that management is genuinely making tough choices
designed to yield long-run benefits to shareholders, but which individuals
outside the corporation cannot envision.
Armed with the attitude that the burden of proof lies with those mak-
ing the disclosures, the analyst is now prepared to tackle the basic financial
statements. Methods for uncovering the information they conceal, as well
as that which they reveal, constitute the heart of the next three chapters.
From that elementary level right on up to making investment decisions with
the techniques presented in the final two chapters, it will pay to maintain an
adversarial stance at all times.

CHAPTER 2
The Balance Sheet
T
he balance sheet is a remarkable invention, yet it has two fundamental
shortcomings. First, while it is in theory quite useful to have a summary
ofthevaluesofalltheassetsownedbyanenterprise,thesevaluesfrequently
proveelusiveinpractice.Second,manykindsofthingshavevalueandcould
be construed, at least by the layperson, as assets. Not all of them can be
assigned a specific value and recorded on a balance sheet, however. For
example, proprietors of service businesses are fond of saying, “Our assets
go down the elevator every night.” Everybody acknowledges the value of a
company’s human capital – the skills and creativity of its employees – but
no one has devised a means of valuing it precisely enough to reflect it on the
balance sheet. Accountants do not go to the opposite extreme of banishing
allintangibleassetsfromthebalancesheet,butthedividinglinebetweenthe
permitted and the prohibited is inevitably an arbitrary one.
1
During the late 1990s, doctrinal disputes over accounting for assets
intensified as intellectual capital came to represent growing proportions of

today’s economy, and therefore traditional accounting systems are at a loss
to capture much of what goes on,” argued Baruch Lev of New York Uni-
versity. As examples, he cited the rise in value resulting from a drug passing
a key clinical test and from a computer software program being success-
fully beta-tested. “There’s no accounting event because no money changes
hands,” Lev noted.3
THE VALUE PROBLEM
The problems of value that accountants wrestle with have also historically
plagued philosophers, economists, tax assessors, and the judiciary. Moral
philosophers over the centuries grappled with the notion of a fair price for
merchantstocharge.Earlyeconomistsattemptedtoderiveaproduct’sintrin-
sic value by calculating the units of labor embodied in it. Several distinct
approaches have evolved for assessing real property. These includecapital-
ization of rentals, inferring a value based on sales of comparable properties,
and estimating the value a property would have if put to its highest and best
use. Similar theories are involved when the courts seek to value the assets
ofbankrupt companies, although vigorous negotiations among thedifferent
classes of creditors play an essential role in the final determination.
Withcommendableclarityofvision,theaccountingprofessionlongago
cut through the thicket of competing theories by establishinghistorical cost
as the basis for valuing nonfinancial assets. The cost of acquiring or con-
structinganassethasthegreatadvantageofbeinganobjectiveandverifiable
figure. As a benchmark for value, it is, therefore, compatible with accoun-
tants’ traditional principle of conservatism.
Whatever its strengths, however, the historical cost system also has dis-
advantages that are apparent even to the beginning student of accounting.
As already noted, basing valuation on transactions means that no asset can
be reflected on the balance sheet unless it has been involved in a transaction.
The most familiar difficulty that results from this convention involves
goodwill. Company A has value above and beyond its tangible assets, in the
form of well-regarded brand names and close relationships with merchants

The Balance Sheet 35
built up over many years. None of this intangible value appears on
Company A’s balance sheet, however, for it has never figured in a transac-
tion. When Company B acquires Company A at a premium to book value,
though, the intangibles are suddenly recognized. To the benefit of users of
financial statements, Company A’s assets become more fully reflected. On
the negative side, Company A’s balance sheet now says it is more valuable
than Company C, which has equivalent tangible and intangible assets but
has never been acquired.
The difficulties a person may encounter in the quest for true value are
numerous.Consider,forexample,apieceofspecializedmachinery,acquired
for $50,000. On the day the equipment is put into service, even before any
controversies surrounding depreciation rates arise, value is already a matter
of opinion. The company that made the purchase would presumably not
have paid $50,000 if it perceived the machine to be worth a lesser amount.
Asecuredlender,however,islikelytotakeamoreconservativeview.Forone
thing, the lender will find it difficult in the future to monitor the value of the
collateral through comparables, since only a few similar machines (perhaps
none, if the piece is customized) are produced each year. Furthermore, if the
lender is ultimately forced to foreclose, there may be no ready purchaser
of the machinery for $50,000, since its specialized nature makes it useful
to only a small number of manufacturers. All of the potential purchasers,
moreover, may be located hundreds of miles away, so that the machinery’s
value in a liquidation would be further reduced by the costs of transporting
and reinstalling it.
Theproblemsencountered inevaluatingone-of-a-kindindustrialequip-
ment might appear to be eliminated when dealing with actively traded com-
modities such as crude oil reserves. Even this type of asset, however, resists
precise, easily agreed-on valuation. Since oil companies frequently buy and
sell reserves in the ground, current transaction prices are readily available.
These transactions, however, are based on estimates of eventual production
from unique geologic formations, for there are no means of directly measur-
ing oil reserves. Even when petroleum engineers employ the most advanced
technology, their estimates rely heavily on judgment and inference. It is not
unheard of, moreover, for a well to begin to produce at the rate predicted
by the best scientific methods, only to peter out a short time later, ultimately
yielding just a fraction of its estimated reserves. With this degree of uncer-
tainty, recording the true value of oil reserves is not a realistic objective for
accountants. Users of financial statements can, at best, hope for informed
guesses, and there is considerable room for honest people (not to mention
rogues with vested interests) to disagree.
If anything, this particular valuation issue is becoming even more
problematic as the global economy moves toward greater reliance on

environmentally friendlier energy sources. Already, a largescale shift from
coal to natural gas, a cleaner fuel, has produced huge write-downs of asset
values. For example, the reported asset value of all of Peabody Energy’s
U.S. thermal coal mining assets dropped by 52 percent in the first half of
2020.

Thinking more broadly than just about the energy sector, a wide
range of companies are vulnerable to disruption in today’s economy. Scale
economies achieved through massive purchases of assets provide no sure
protection against inroads by new competitors armed with innovative
technologies or business models. Salvage values may be minimal on assets
dedicated to obsolete modes of operation. Accordingly, analysts must
closely monitor the returns that companies are earning on their assets to
ascertain whether the accounting-based values are durable.
COMPARABILITY PROBLEMS IN THE VALUATION OF
FINANCIAL ASSETS
The numerous difficulties of evaluating physical assets make historical cost
anappealing,ifimperfect,solutionbyvirtueofitsobjectivity.Somefinancial
assets are unaffected by those difficulties, however. They trade daily and
actively in well-organized markets such as the New York Stock Exchange. It
isfeasibletovaluesuchassetsonthebasisofmarketquotationsattheendof
the financial reporting period, rather than according to historical cost, and
achieve both objectivity and accuracy.
Analysts must keep in mind, however, that the values assigned to huge
amounts of financial assets on many companies’ balance sheets arenot ver-
ifiable on the basis of continuously quoted prices determined in deep, liquid
markets. Under Fair Value Accounting, an asset of this sort is valued at
the amount at which it currently could be bought or sold in a transaction
between willing parties, not including a liquidation sale. If no active market
for the asset exists, a company can determine its balance sheet value on the
basis of quoted prices for similar assets that do trade actively. In this case,
the company must make assumptions about how the market would adjust
for the fact that the actively traded and non-actively traded assets are not
identical. If no comparables exist, a company can use its own assumptions
about the assumptions market participants would use to offer or bid for the
asset it is valuing. Users of financial statements can reasonably expect that
some companies’ assumptions about assumptions will be on the liberal side,
potentially inflating the value of non-actively traded assets. Abuse of this
discretion was one element of the Enron fraud (see Chapter 11).

The Balance Sheet 37
Thankstomarketinnovationsofrecentdecades,alargecategoryofsub-
jectively valued financial assets consists of non-exchange-tradedderivatives.
(The collective term for these assets reflects that their valuations derive from
the values of other assets, such as commodities or indexes of securities.) In
a financial market crisis, the price at which such instruments can be bought
or sold is subject to violent swings. Companies understandably would pre-
fer that the investors who determine their stock prices not see or consider
such losses in value, which the companies invariably (but not always cor-
rectly) characterize as temporary. For a financial institution, an even bigger
worry is that its regulator will declare the institution insolvent, based on a
market-induced and genuinely temporary decline in the balance sheet value
of its derivatives.
Seeing these disadvantages to themselves, issuers of financial statements
have resisted the imposition of full-blown fair value accounting. Under
the compromise embodied in the 1993 Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) 115, financial instruments are valued according to
their intended use by the company issuing the financial statements. If the
company intends to hold a debt security to maturity, it records the value at
amortized cost less impairment, if any. (The amortization is the write-down
of a premium over face value or write-up of discount from face value, over
the remaining period to maturity. Impairment is a loss of value arising from
a clear indication that the obligor will be unable to satisfy the terms of
the obligation.) If the company intends to sell a debt or equity security in
the near term, hoping to make a trading profit, it records the instrument
at fair value and includes unrealized gains and losses in earnings. A third
option is for the company to classify a debt or equity security as neither
held-to-maturity or a trading security, but instead in the noncommittal
category of available for sale. In that case, the instrument is recorded at
fair value, but unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and
instead reported in other comprehensive income, a separate component of
shareholders’ equity. SFAS 157, issued in 2006, sought to clarify further the
fair value definition.
Theessentialpointisthatanassetmaybevaluedononecompany’sbal-
ance sheet at a substantially different value than an identical asset is valued

representations of their intentions.
It is even possible for an asset to be carried at two different values on a
single balance sheet. For instance, when equity values plummeted in 2008,

private equity funds that placed different values on the company. Under-
lying the value for those funds on the institution’s balance sheet would be
nonequivalent valuations of identical shares.
Inconsistent valuations can also undermine the integrity of an enter-
prise’s balance sheet without involvement of outside parties such as private
equity firms. An inquest into the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers found that each trading desk within the investment bank had its
own methodology for pricing assets. Methodologies differed even within
a single asset class, and the Product Control Group, which was supposed
to enforce standardization in valuation, was understaffed for the task.
Incidentally, some of the methodologies employed at Lehman Brothers
were dubious, to say the least. For example, the investment bank based its
second-quarter 2008 prices for one group of assets on a Morgan Stanley
research note published in the first quarter of that year.

INSTANTANEOUS WIPEOUT OF VALUE
Because the value of many assets is so subjective, balance sheets are prone
tosudden,arbitraryrevisions.Tociteoneexample,in2018GeneralElectric
wrote off $17 billion in value of the power equipment businesses purchased
in 2015 from France’s Alstom. The reduction in value exceeded the total
amount GE paid for the businesses, which was $10 billion. This apparent
anomaly arose from thegoodwill recorded in the acquisition.
When GE sorted out accounting for the acquisition a year after it was
completed, the company placed a value of $21 billion on the power busi-
nesses’ gross assets and valued its liabilities at $23 billion. After removing
some minority interests, GE concluded that the acquired operations had a
net worth of –$7 billion. The $17 billion difference between that figure and
the $10 billion purchase price constituted the goodwill that GE wrote down
ontheacquiredAlstombusinesses,justthreeyearsafterthedealclosed.The
company wrote down $6 billion of other assets at the same time.
In 2016 GE justified paying $10 billion for businesses with –$7 billion
ofbookvalueonthebasisofexpectedsynergy(possiblythemostdangerous
word in finance), including incremental revenue from cross-selling opportu-
nities.Thefollowingyear,GEchiefexecutiveofficerJohnFlanneryremarked
that if GE could go back in a time machine, it would pay far less than it
shelled out for the Alstom assets. Unfortunately, time machines were not
part of GE’s product line and Flannery was ousted as in conjunction with
the total $23 billion write-off.
Jonathan Ford of theFinancial Times suggested there was more than
bad timing or bad luck behind the swift evaporation of the asset value

attributed to the Alstom assets.6 Writing in 2018, Ford noted that the
total amount of goodwill on the balance sheets of S&P 500 companies
ballooned from $1.8 trillion to $2.9 trillion. He attributed this dramatic
rise to a protracted merger boom, combined with the economy’s shift from
manufacturing to services. Many leading companies, he pointed out, now
have little in the way of tangible assets, meaning that larger portions of
acquisition prices than formerly would be chalked up to goodwill.
Up until 2000 in the U.S. and 2005 in Europe, acquirers that paid more
than the purchased assets’ tangible value had to amortize the resulting
goodwill year-by-year. That reduced the reported profits generated by the
acquired business. With that requirement now removed, said theFinancial
Times columnist, corporate CEOs could “buy earnings” and thereby
increase their growth-based bonuses and report respectable profits even on
mediocre businesses acquired at excessive prices.
The game is up only when the accountants determine that the asset
in question has become impaired. Ford asserted that the test for a
write-down-triggering impairment, namely, deterioration in expected future
cash flows, can easily be gamed. The day of reckoning cannot be deferred
indefinitely, but in the meantime unwary investors will have an inflated
notion of the acquirer’s asset value.
Ideally, analysts will not wait for the accountants to make it official
that acquired assets have deteriorated in value. Instead, they will adjust a
company’s balance sheet to reflect telltale signs of overstatement. By paying
attention to these early warning signals, they can potentially avoid being
caught off guard by asset revaluations.
By way of illustration, on January 18, 2013, Caterpillar Inc. said
it was taking a noncash goodwill impairment charge of approximately
$580 million. The impaired assets came with the June 2012 acquisition of
Mining Machinery Limited (ERA), including its wholly owned subsidiary.
Zhengzhou Siwei Mechanical & Electrical Manufacturing Co., Ltd.,
commonly referred to as “Siwei.”
Caterpillar attributed the discrepancy between the value attributed to
theassetsatthetimeoftheacquisitionandthewritten-downvaluelessthan
a year later to “deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct”
bySiweiseniormanagers.
7 DuncanMavinofthe Wall Street Journalpointed
out, however, that due diligence prior to the acquisition “must have raised
red flags.”8 In Mavin’s view, ERA appeared to be headed for a working
capital crisis, based on a 37 percent jump in accounts receivable from 2010
to 2011, far exceeding the 10 percent increase in sales over the same period.
Inventories not yet shifted to customers meanwhile rose by 234 percent.

that rising raw material costs and swelling bad debt allowance would cause
it to miss a profit target. The hope was that being acquired by Caterpillar, a

customers credit and favorable terms in order to compete with state-owned

In many other instances, shareholders and bondholders have not been so
fortunate. Analysts can help investors avoid unpleasant surprises by paying
attention to the sort of early warning signals detailed by Mavin.
If this seems a daunting task, the reader may take encouragement from
thesuccessofthebond-ratingagenciesinsiftingthroughthefinancialreport-
ing folderol to get to the economic substance. The bursting of Tech Bub-
ble of the 1990s in 2001 produced numerous multibillion-dollar goodwill
write-offs. They did not, as one might have expected, set off a massive wave
of rating downgrades. As in many previous instances of companies writ-
ing down assets, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s did not equate changes
in accounting values with reduced protection for lenders. To be sure, if a
company wrote off a billion dollars’ worth of goodwill, its ratio of assets to
liabilities declined. Its ratio oftangible assets to liabilities did not change,
however. The rating agencies monitored both ratios but had customarily
attached greater significance to the version that ignored intangible assets
such as goodwill.
HOW GOOD IS GOODWILL?

Their earning power, so the story went, derived from inspired ideas and

which conventional accounting was designed. To adapt to the economy’s
changing profile, proclaimed the heralds of the new paradigm, the account-
ing rule makers had to allow all sorts of items traditionally expensed to be
capitalized onto the asset side of the balance sheet. Against that backdrop,
analysts who questioned the value represented by goodwill, an item long
deemed legitimate under GAAP, look conservative indeed.

In reality, the stock market euphoria that preceded some mind-boggling
write-offs illustrated in classic fashion the reasons for rating agency skepti-
cism toward goodwill. Through stock-for-stock acquisitions, the sharp rise

capitalizations. Amalgamator uses stock held in its treasury to acquire Con-
solidator for $80 million. The purchase price represents a premium of 331∕3
percent above the prevailing market price.
Letusnowexamineakeyindicatorofcreditquality.Priortotheacquisi-
tion, Amalgamator’s ratio of total assets to total liabilities (see Chapter 13)
is 1.25 times, while the comparable figure for Consolidator is 1.18 times.
The stock-for-stock acquisition introduces no new hard assets (e.g., cash,
inventories, or factories). Neither does the transaction eliminate any exist-
ing liabilities. Logically, then, Consolidator’s 1.18 times ratio should drag
down Amalgamator’s 1.25 times ratio, resulting in a figure somewhere in
between for the combined companies.
In fact, though, the total-assets-to-total-liabilities ratio after the deal
is 1.25 times. By paying a premium to Consolidator’s tangible asset
value, Amalgamator creates $20 million of goodwill. This intangible asset
represents just 1.4 percent of the combined companies’ total assets, but
that suffices to enable Amalgamator to acquire a company with a weaker
debt-quality ratio without showing any deterioration on that measure.
Ifthisoutcome seemsperverse, consider Scenario II.Asthescene opens,
anexplosivestockmarketrallyhasdrivenupbothcompanies’sharesto150
percent of book value. The ratio of total assets to total liabilities, however,
remains at 1.25 times for Amalgamator and 1.18 times for Consolidator.
Conservative bond buyers take comfort from the fact that the assets remain
on the books at historical cost less depreciation, unaffected by euphoria on
the stock exchange that may dissipate at any time without notice.
As in Scenario I, Amalgamator pays a premium of 33
1∕3 percent above
the prevailing market price to acquire Consolidator. The premium is calcu-
latedonahighermarketcapitalization,however.Consequently,thepurchase
price rises from $80 million to $120 million. Instead of creating $20 million
of goodwill, the acquisition gives rise to a $60 million intangible asset.
When the conservative bond investors calculate the combined compa-
nies’ ratio of total assets to total liabilities, they make a startling discovery.
Somehow, putting together a company boasting a 1.25 times ratio with
another sporting a 1.18 times ratio has produced an entity with a ratio of
1.28 times. Moreover, a minute of experimentation with the numbers will
show that the ratio would be higher still if Amalgamator had bought Con-
solidator at a higher price. Seemingly, the simplest way for a company to
improve its credit quality is to make stock-for-stock acquisitions at grossly
excessive prices.
Naturally, this absurd conclusion embodies a fallacy. In reality, the
receivables, inventories, and machinery available to be sold to satisfy
creditors’ claims are no greater in Scenario II than in Scenario I. Given that
the total-assets-to-total-liabilities ratio is lower at Consolidator than at

The Balance Sheet 43
Amalgamator, the combined companies’ ratio logically must be lower than
at Amalgamator. Common sense further states that Amalgamator cannot
truly have better credit quality if it overpays for Consolidator than if it
acquires the company at a fair price.
As it happens, there is a simple way out of the logical conundrum. Let
us exclude goodwill in calculating the ratio of assets to liabilities. As shown
in the exhibit, Amalgamator’s ratio oftangible assets to total liabilities fol-
lowing its acquisition of Consolidator is 1.23 times in both Scenario I and
ScenarioII.Thisistheoutcomethatbestreflectseconomicreality.Toensure
that they reach this commonsense conclusion, credit analysts must follow
the rating agencies’ practice of calculating balance sheet ratios both with
and without goodwill and other intangible assets, giving greater emphasis
to the latter version.
Calculating ratios on a tangibles-only basis is not equivalent to saying
that the intangibles have no value. Amalgamator is likely to recoup all or
mostofthe$60millionaccountedforasgoodwillifitturnsaroundandsells
Consolidator tomorrow. Such a transaction is hardly likely, however. A sale
several years hence, after stock prices have fallen from today’s lofty levels,
is a more plausible scenario. Under such conditions, the full $60 million
probably will not be recoverable.
Even leaving aside the possibility of a plunge in stock prices, it makes
eminent sense to eliminate or sharply downplay the value of goodwill in a
balance-sheet-basedanalysisofcreditquality.Unlikeinventoriesoraccounts
receivable, goodwill is not an asset that can be readily sold orfactored to
raisecash.Neithercanacompanyenterintoa sale-leaseback ofitsgoodwill,
as it can with its plant and equipment. In short, goodwill is not a separable
asset that management can either convert into cash or use to raise cash to
extricate itself from a financial tight spot. Therefore, the relevance of good-
will to an analysis of asset protection is questionable.
On the whole, the rating agencies appear to have shown sound judg-
ment during the 1990s by resisting the New Economy’s siren song. While
enthusiasm mounted for all sorts of intangible assets, they continued to gear
their analysis to tangible-assets-only versions of key balance sheet ratios. By
and large, therefore, companies did not alter the way they were perceived
by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s when they suddenly took an ax to their
intangible assets.
More generally, asset write-offs do not usually cause ratings to fall.
Occasionally, to be sure, the announcement of a write-off coincides with
the disclosure of a previously unrevealed impairment of value, ordinarily
arising from operating problems. That sort of development may trigger
a downgrade. In addition, a write-off sometimes coincides with a decision
to close down certain operations. The associated severance costs (payments

to terminated employees) may represent a substantial cash outlay that
does weaken the company’s financial position. Finally, a write-off can put
a company in violation of a debt covenant (see Chapter 12). Nervous
lenders may exploit thetechnical defaultby canceling the company’s credit
lines, precipitating aliquidity crisis. In and of itself, however, adjusting the
balance sheet to economic reality does not represent a reduction in credit
protection measures.
LOSING VALUE THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY
Goodwill write-offs by high-tech, asset-light companies make splashy head-
lines in the financial news, but they by no means represent the only way
in which balance sheet assets suddenly and sharply decline in value. In the
“Old Economy,” where countless manufacturers earn slender margins on
low-tech industrial goods, companies are vulnerable to long-run erosion in
profitability. Common pitfalls include fierce price competition and a fail-
ure, because of near-term pressures to conserve cash, to invest adequately in
modernization of plants and equipment. As the rate of return on their fixed
assets declines, producers of industrial commodities such as paper, chemi-
cals, and steel must eventually face up to the permanent impairment of their
reported asset values.

Indeed,thereisnoguaranteethatacompanywillfullycometogripswithits

value? If so, the implication is that investors are willing to own the com-
pany’s shares and accept a return of only 8 percent ($24 million divided by
$300 million), even though a 14 percent return is available on other stocks.
There is no obvious reason that investors would voluntarily make such a
sacrifice, however. Therefore, Company Z’s book value is almost certainly
overstated.

The Balance Sheet 45
A reasonable estimate of the low-profit company’s true equity value
would be the amount that produces a return on equity equivalent to the
going rate:
Company Z average earnings stream
X = Average return on equity
for U.S. corporations
$24 million
X = 14%
X = $171 million
Although useful as a general guideline, this method of adjusting the
shareholders’ equity of underperforming companies neglects a number of
important subtleties. For one thing, Company Z may be considered riskier
thantheaveragecompany.Inthatcase,shareholderswoulddemandareturn
higher than 14 percent to hold its shares. Furthermore, cash flow may be a
better indicator of the company’s economic performance than net income.
This would imply that the adjustment ought to be made to the ratio of
cash flow to market capitalization, rather than return on equity. Further-
more,investors’rate-of-returnrequirementsreflectexpectedfutureearnings,
rather than past results. Depending on the outlook for its business, it might
be reasonable to assume that Company Z will either realize higher profits in
the next five years than in the past five or see its profits plunge further. By
the same token, securities analysts may expect the peer group of stocks that
represent alternative investments to produce a return higher or lower than
14 percent in coming years. The further the analyst travels in search of true
value, it seems, the murkier the notion becomes.
TRUE EQUITY IS ELUSIVE
What financial analysts are actually seeking, but are unable to find in the
financialstatements,isequityaseconomistsconceiveofit.Inscholarlystud-
ies, the termequity generally refers not to accounting book value, but to the
present value of future cash flows accruing to the firm’s owners. Consider a
firm that is deriving huge earnings from a trademark that has no account-
ing value because it was developedinternally rather than acquired. The
presentvalueoftheprofitsderivedfromthetrademarkwouldbeincludedin
the economist’s definition of equity but not in the accountant’s, potentially
creating a gap of billions of dollars between the two.
The contrast between the economist’s and the accountant’s notions
of equity is dramatized by the phenomenon of negative equity. In the

46 THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
economist’s terms, equity of less than zero is synonymous with bankruptcy.
The reasoning is that when a company’s liabilities exceed thepresent value
of all future income, it is not rational for the owners to continue paying
off the liabilities. They will stop making payments currently due to lenders
and trade creditors, which will in turn prompt the holders of the liabilities
to try to recover their claims by forcing the company into bankruptcy.
Suppose, on the other hand, that the present value of a highly successful
company’s future income exceeds the value of its liabilities by a substantial
margin. If the company runs into a patch of bad luck, recording net losses
for several years running and writingoff selected operations, the book value
of its assets may fall below the value of its liabilities. In accounting terms,
the result is negative shareholders’ equity. The economic value of the assets,
however, may still exceed the stated value of the liabilities. Under such
circumstances, the company has no reason to consider either suspending
payments to creditors or filing for bankruptcy.
TheWesternUnionCompany’sSeptember2006spin-offfromFirstData
Corporationdemonstratedthatnegativeequityinanaccountingsenseisnot
synonymous with insolvency. In connection with the spin-off, the provider
of money transfer services distributed approximately $3.5 billion to First
Data in the form of cash and debt securities. Net of other events during
the period, shareholders’ equity fell to –$314.8 million on December 31,
2006, from $2.8 billion one year earlier. By producing solid earnings over
the next three years, Western Union boosted shareholders’ equity to $353.5
million by December 31, 2009. Anyone who mistook the year-end 2006
negative figure as an indication of Western Union’s economic value would

versus a decline of only 15.9 percent for Western Union.
BOOK VALUE MAY OVERSTATE REALITY
Just as book value can understate equity in an economic sense, it can
overstate it too. Consider Celadon Group, which at the time of the
events described here was the twelfth largest U.S. trucker focusing on
truckload shipments. As detailed in an April 5, 2017, report by Prescience
Point Research Group
9, securities analysts generally valued Celadon’s
shares at one times tangible book value (TBV), which is calculated by
subtracting goodwill from companywide book value (total assets minus
total liabilities). As reported by Celadon, TBV equated to $10.80 per
share at the time of Prescience Point’s report, implying that its shares were

k
The Balance Sheet 47
significantly undervalued at $6.25. The research firm maintained, however,
that Celadon’s true TBV was $0.42 per share.
Taking into account as well other signs of financial misreporting,
Prescience Point valued Celadon’s shares at zero. That price target was
not reached in the near term, but less than a month after publication of
the report the stock closed at $1.55, down by 75 percent. In the interim,
the company announced that Chief Operating Officer Eric Meek had
resigned after its auditor, BKD, LLP, determined that investors should not
rely on the fiscal 2016 financial statements. By the end of 2019 Celadon
had filed for bankruptcy and its shares, long since delisted by the New York
Stock Exchange, were quoted at less than $0.02. In addition, the former
president of a former Celadon subsidiary had pleaded guilty to a fraud by
which Celadon avoided disclosing substantial losses and misrepresented its
financial condition. Two of his superiors were under indictment.
Among the factors that pointed to a vast overstatement of tangible
book value was an exhibit in a Securities and Exchange Commission 10-Q
filing.Itconcerneda50/50off-balancesheetjointventure(JV)thatCeladon
formed with Element Fleet Management. The transaction’s background
was that under terms of its sales of tractors (which pull the semi-trailers in
tractor-trailer units) to Element, Celadon agreed to cover up to 10 percent
of Element’s losses on its purchases. (These losses arose if the prices Element
obtained in the used tractor market were less than the tractors’ depreciated
cost.)Inaddition,Celadonagreedtocover,onaninterimbasis,anyshortfall
on lease payments from Element’s operators. Element was obligated to
repay these “lease shortfall advances” at some point.
These arrangements became very costly for Celadon when used tractor
prices and lease utilization rates began to plummet in late 2015. Cash flow
turned negative as Celadon shelled out $74 million to cover Element’s losses
on its purchased tractors and $31.9 million for lease shortfalls. Under the
new JV arrangement Cedalon would no longer have to make up shortfalls
at Element.
Element contributed $100 million of equity to the JV, consisting of
$667.5 million of equipment and $567.6 million of debt. Celadon likewise
contributed $100 million of equity – $36.4 million in cash and $63.6
million of equipment. Based on those reported values, Celadon valued its
50 percent stake in the $200 million joint venture at $100 million.
Prescience Point questioned that valuation. To begin with, Celadon rep-
resented that just before the JV was formed it recovered $31.8 million of
previous lease shortfall advances from Element. According to the JV sub-
scription agreement included as an exhibit in Celadon’s 10-Q filing, how-
ever, Element made a $31.8 million “Daylight Loan” to the JV, which in
turn advanced the money to Celadon. That was the source of the cash that

48 THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Celadon contributed to the JV, which immediately used it to repay the Day-
light Loan. Prescience Point concluded that the transactions constituted a
sham loan designed to create the false appearance of recovery by Celadon
of its earlier lease shortfall advances. With $31.8 million of Celadon’s sup-
posed $100 million equity contribution going to repay the Daylight Loan
made a short while earlier, Celadon’s actual equity contribution was just
$68.2 million, said Prescience.
As for the other partner’s ostensible $100 million equity contribution,
Prescience Point argued that the equipment valued at $567.6 million by Ele-
ment was under-depreciated by $171.5 million. In the 1.7 years in which
Element had owned equipment purchased from Celadon, it had recorded
$80.9millionindepreciationon$740.0millionofequipment.Thatequated
to 6.4 percent annual depreciation, implying that Element was assuming a
15-yearaverageusefullife,whichPresciencePointdeemednotevenremotely
consistent with tractors’ actual useful lives. Celadon was assuming a use-
ful life of only four years and a 40 percent salvage value, resulting in a
much higher 15 percent annual depreciation rate. Two peer companies were
applying 15 percent and 17 percent rates. The $171.5 million by which
Prescience Point estimated that Element’s contributed equipment was over-
valued exceeded the sum of Element’s stated $100 million equity contribu-
tion and the $68.2 million valid portion of Celadon’s nominal $100 million
equity contribution. (The nominal amount was reduced by the $31.8 mil-
lion that was quickly shuffled in and out). That left the joint venture with
no actual equity value. Fifty percent of nothing is nothing, leading to the
conclusion that the $100 million joint venture stake on Celadon’s balance
sheet was overstated by $100 million.
Celadon further inflated its TBV by increasing the useful lives of
both its tractors and its trailers. Separate from that balance sheet effect,
PresciencePointspiedanotherredflaginthecompany’sfiringofthetop-tier
audit firm KPMG in 2013, a year after KPMG required Celadon to restate
its financials. KPMG’s replacement was a regional auditor, BKD LLP.
Between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2016 Celadon’s annual audit fees increased
by 179.6 percent. Prescience Point noted that in two of the largest financial
frauds in history, Enron (see Chapter 11) and Satyam, outsized audit fees
compromised the auditors’ ability or willingness to carry out their duties
adequately.
Predictably, Celadon’s management brushed off Prescience Point’s
criticisms, alleging that the research firm was short its stock. One securities
analyst sprang to the company’s defense, urging investors to buy Celadon’s
stock on the dip. That proved an ill-timed recommendation in light of the
one-day 55 percent drop that followed on May 2. Users of financial state-
ments should expect – and regard with skepticism – reflexive and sometimes

come to light.
PROS AND CONS OF A MARKET-BASED EQUITY FIGURE
Relying on market capitalization is the practical means by which finan-
cial analysts commonly estimate the economists’ more theoretically rigor-
ous definition of equity as the present value of expected future cash flows.
Monumental difficulties confront anyone who instead attempts to arrive at
the figure through conventional financial reporting systems. The problem is
that traditional accounting favors items that can be objectively measured.
Unfortunately, future earnings and cash flows are unobservable. Moreover,
calculating present value requires selecting adiscount raterepresenting the
company’s cost of capital.Determining the cost of capital is a notoriously
controversialsubjectinthefinancialfield,complicatedbythornytaxconsid-
erations and risk adjustments. The figures needed to calculate economists’
equity are not, in short, the kind of numbers accountants like to deal with.
Their ideal value is a price on an invoice that can be independently verified
by a canceled check.
Market capitalization has additional advantages beyond its compara-
tive ease of calculation. For one thing, it represents the consensus of large
numbers of analysts and investors who constantly monitor companies’
future earnings prospects as the basis for their evaluations. In addition, an
up-to-the-minute market capitalization can be calculated on any day that
the stock exchange is open. This represents a considerable advantage over
the shareholders’ equity shown on the balance sheet, which is updated only
once every three months. Market capitalization adjusts instantaneously
to news such as a surprise product launch by a competitor, an explosion
that halts production at a key plant, or a sudden hike in interest rates by
the Federal Reserve. In contrast, these events may never be reflected in
book value in a discrete, identifiable manner. Ardent advocates of market
capitalization cannot conceive of any more accurate estimate of true
equity value.
Againsttheseadvantages,however,theanalystmustweighseveraldraw-
backs to relying on market capitalization to estimate a company’s actual
equity value. For one thing, while the objectivity of a price quotation estab-
lished in a competitive market is indeed a benefit, it is obtainable only for
corporations with publicly traded stocks. For privately owned companies,
the proponents of market capitalization typically generate a proxy for true
equitythroughreferencetoindustry-peerpubliccompanies.Forexample,to
calculate the equity of a privately owned paper producer, an analyst might

multiply the publicly traded peer group’s average price-earnings ratio (see
Chapter14)bytheprivatecompany’searnings.Often,thepeer-groupmulti-
pleisbasedon EBITDA (seeChapter8)ratherthannetincome.Thismethod
can expand the peer group to include companies no longer publicly traded
but recently acquired in leveraged buyouts. A limitation of the peer-group
approach is that it fails to capture company-specific factors and therefore
does not reap one major benefit of using market capitalization as a gauge of
actual equity value.
Even if analysts restrict their reliance on market capitalization to
publicly traded companies, they will still encounter pitfalls. Consider, for
example,thatonMonday,February5,2018,the Dow Jones Industrial Aver-
age plunged by 1,175 points, or 4.6 percent. The price of Dow component
Boeing dropped by 5.7 percent, representing a $20 billion loss in market
value. No major negative news was reported about the aerospace company
that day and stock analysts had recently raised their earnings-per-share
estimates on the company. Just ten days later, with the stock market gauge
on the rebound, Boeing’s shares had more than fully recovered their Friday,
February 2, 2018, value.
Notwithstanding the theoretical arguments for regarding market capi-
talization as a company’s true equity value, short-run changes of the mag-
nitude experienced by Boeing on February 5, 2018, raise a caution. In a
literal interpretation, even a huge, sudden swing in market capitalization
indicates a change in a company’s earnings prospects. In extreme cases,
though, a temporary shift in the aggregate value of a company’s shares can
appear to reveal more about the dynamics of the stock market. An infer-
encealongthoselinesissupportedbyextensiveacademicresearchconducted
under the rubric of behavioral finance. Incontrast to more traditional finan-
cial economists, the behavioralists doubt that investors invariably process
information accurately and act on it according to rules of rationality, as
defined by economists. Empirical studies by adherents of behavioral finance
show that instead of faithfully tracking companies’ intrinsic values, market
pricesfrequentlyoverreacttonewsevents.Eventhoughinvestorssupposedly
evaluate stocks on the basis of expected future dividends (see Chapter 14),
the behavioralists find that the stock market is far more volatile than the
variability of dividends can explain.
10
To be sure, these conclusions remain controversial. Traditionalists have
challenged the empirical studies that underlie them, producing a vigorous
debate. Nevertheless, the findings of behavioral finance lend moral support
to analysts who find it hard to believe that the one-day erasure of billions
of market capitalization must automatically be a truer representation of the
company’s change in equity value than a figure derived from financial state-
ment data.

Market capitalization, then, is a useful tool but not one to be heeded
blindly.Intheend,trueequityremainsanelusivenumber.Insteadofstriving
fortheoreticalpurityonthematter,analystsshouldadoptaflexibleattitude,
using the measure of equity value most useful to a particular application.
Forexample,statedbalancesheetfigures,derivedmainlyfromhistorical
cost, are the ones that matter in estimating the risk that a company will
violate a loan covenant requiring maintenance of a minimum ratio of debt
to net worth (see Chapter 12). The historical cost figures are less relevant to
a liquidation analysis aimed at gauging creditors’ asset protection. That is,
if a company were sold to pay off its debts, the price it would fetch would
probablyreflectthemarket’scurrentvaluationofitsassetsmorenearlythan
the historical cost of those assets.
Neither measure, however, could be expected to equate precisely to
the proceeds that would actually be realized in a sale of the company.
Between the time that a sale was decided on and executed, its market
capitalization might change significantly, purely as a function of the stock
market’s dynamics. By the same token, the current balance sheet values of
certainassetscouldbeoverstated,throughtardyrecognitionofimpairments
in value, or understated, reflecting the prohibition on writing up an asset
that has not changed hands.
THE COMMON FORM BALANCE SHEET
Deterioration in a company’s financial position may catch investors by
surprise because it occurs gradually and is reported suddenly. It is also
possibleforanincreaseinfinancial risktosneakuponanalystseventhough
it is reported as it occurs. Many companies alter the mix of their assets, or
their methods of financing them, in a gradual fashion. To spot these subtle
yet frequently significant changes, it is helpful to prepare a common form
balance sheet.
Also known as the percentage balance sheet, the common form balance
sheetconvertseachassetintoapercentageoftotalassetsandeachliabilityor
component of equity into a percentage of total liabilities and shareholders’
equity. Exhibit 2.2 applies this technique to the 2019 balance sheet of WEC
Energy, a generator and distributor of natural gas.
The analyst can view a company’s common form balance sheets over
several quarters to check, for example, whether inventory is increasing sig-
nificantly as a percentage of total assets. An increase of that sort might
signalinvoluntary inventory buildupresultingfromanunforeseenslowdown
in sales. Similarly, a rise in accounts receivable as a percentage of assets
may point to increasing reliance on the extension of credit to generate sales

CONCLUSION
Bycloselyexaminingtheunderlyingvaluesreflectedinthebalancesheet,this
chapter emphasizes the need for a critical, rather than a passive, approach
to financial statement analysis. The concepts and case studies underscore
the chapter’s dominant theme, the elusiveness of true value. Mere tinkering
with the conventions of historical cost cannot bring accounting values into
line with equity as economists define it and, more to the point, as financial
analysts would ideally like it to be. Market capitalization probably repre-
sents a superior approach in many instances. Under certain circumstances,
however, serious questions can be raised about the validity of a company’s
stock price as a standard of value. In the final analysis, users of financial
statements cannot retreat behind the numbers derived by any one method.
They must instead exercise judgment to draw sound conclusions.

CHAPTER 3
The Income Statement
T
he goal of analyzing an income statement is essentially to determine
whether the story it tells is good, bad, or indifferent. To accomplish this
objective, the analyst draws a few initial conclusions, then puts the income
statement into context by comparing it with income statements of earlier
periods, as well as statements of other companies. These steps are described
in the section of this chapter titled “Making the Numbers Talk.”
Simple techniques of analysis can extract a great deal of information
from an income statement, but the quality of the information is no less
a concern than the quantity. A conscientious analyst must determine how
accurately the statement reflects the issuer’s revenues, expenses, and earn-
ings. This deeper level of scrutiny requires an awareness of imperfections in
the accounting system that can distort economic reality.
The section titled “How Real Are the Numbers?” documents the inde-
fatigability of issuers in devising novel gambits for exploiting these vul-
nerabilities. Analysts must be equally resourceful. In particular, students of
financial statements must keep up with innovations in transforming rising
stock values into revenues of dubious quality. Abuses in reporting supple-
mentary, non-GAAP numbers frequently facilitate such chicanery.
MAKING THE NUMBERS TALK
By observing an income statement in its raw form, the reader can make sev-
eral useful, albeit limited, observations. Jack in the Box’s income statement
for 2019 (Exhibit 3.1) shows, for example, that the company was prof-
itable rather than unprofitable. The statement also provides some sense of
the firm’s cost structure. Cost of goods sold (COGS) was the largest com-
ponent of total costs, at about nine times selling, general, and administra-
tive expenses (SG&A). Depreciation and amortization, essentially a fixed
expense in the short run, was a minor factor.

Based on these observations, we can infer that Jack in the Box’s prof-
itabilityishighlysensitivetochangesinthepricesofmaterialsandlaborthat
are included in COGS. Companies generally have limited control over those
costs. Management has more discretion with SG&A, but changes in that
category have a proportionally smaller impact on profits.

Jack in the Box’s income statement is void in a category that is a sig-
nificant cost item for many other companies – research and development
(R&D). For pharmaceutical producers and companies that create and mar-
ket electronics and computer software, R&D is generally a significant cost
element.
Evenwithinanindustry,thebreakdownofexpensescanvaryfromcom-
pany to company as a function of differing business models and financial
policies. This is illustratedby Exhibit 3.2, which compares the income state-
ments of Jack in the Box and two other restaurant chains, Shake Shack and
Yum! Brands. To facilitate the comparison, the exhibit converts the compo-
nents of the companies’ income statements to percentages of revenues. Note
that percentage breakdowns are also helpful for comparing a single com-
pany’s performance with its results in previous years and for comparing two
different companies on the basis of their effectiveness in controlling costs.
Despite being in the same general line of business, the three companies’
businessprofilesdifferinsignificantways.LikeJackintheBox,ShakeShack
emphasizesburgersinitsmenu,buttheformatofitsrestaurantsisfastcasual
rather than fast food. Yum! Brands differs from the other two by operating
under multiple fast food brands, namely KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell.
Another important difference among the three companies is the percentage
of restaurants that they franchise rather than operate directly. For Shake
Shack it is 3 percent, for Jack in the Box 65 percent, and for Yum! Brands
98 percent.
The divergent levels of franchising contribute to the three restaurant
companies’ dissimilar cost structures. For chains that franchise high per-
centages of their restaurants, franchise fees constitute a large portion of
revenues and items such as ingredients and labor represent comparatively
small portions of their costs. Accordingly, COGS (excluding depreciation
and amortization) ranges from a low of 46.76 percent at mostly franchising
Yum! Brands to a high of 75.12 percent at Shake Shack, which relies the
least on franchising among the three companies. The larger components of
COGS at Shake Shack and Jack in the Box make their profit margins more
sensitive than Yum! Brands’s to increases in food and labor costs.
Differences in cost sensitivities among companies in the same industry
can occur at a more micro level as well. For example, as the U.S. economy
emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, CEO Dave Boennighausen

COGScostcomponentmeansthatothercosts,particularlySG&A,represent
a larger portion of total costs and expenses. Yum! Brands, with the lowest
COGS percentage, has the highest SG&A percentage, 16.38 percent, twice
the level of Jack in the Box, at 8.04 percent. As noted, SG&A expenses may
be more controllable than COGS during business downturns, conferring an
advantageoncompanieswithahigherconcentrationofthecostsideoftheir
business in SG&A.
Shake Shack stands out in the category of interest expense, which
accounts for just 0.07 percent of its sales. That compares with 6.20 percent
for Jack in the Box and 8.95 percent for Yum! Brands. With their greater
reliance on debt financing, the latter two companies’ profitability is more
sensitive than Shake Shack’s to fluctuations in interest rates.
Another factor that may give rise to differences in cost structures within
an industry is the availability of economies of scale, as discussed later.
Greater size does not invariably confer an advantage in profitability. In this
particular comparison, however, pretax margin is highest on the company
with the largest revenue (Yum! Brands) and lowest on the one with the
smallest revenue (Shake Shack).
Costs as percentages of sales also vary among competitors within an
industry for reasons other than differences in business models. Some com-
panies operate more efficiently than others, generating more revenue from
eachdollarofexpenditures.Whereacompanystandsinitslifecyclecanalso
make a difference. A long-established restaurant chain can reach the point
of saturating its market. A younger chain’s profitability may be helped by
not having to choose more marginal locations in order to maintain the pace
of new store openings.

take a difference that is actually a function of business strategy as evidence
of inferior or superior management skills.

The Income Statement 61
Segment reporting data in the notes to financial statements can provide
a measure of insight into the underlying differentiators of profit margins
among companies that tend to be grouped together. Unfortunately, com-
panies have considerable discretion in defining their segments, resulting in
a lack of standardization that often makes comparisons difficult. In such
cases, an analyst must dig deeper for an understanding of the competitors’
cost structures by obtaining as much information as theirinvestor relations
officers will divulge and drawing on industry sources.
HOW REAL ARE THE NUMBERS?
Many individuals are attracted to business careers not only by monetary
rewards but also by the opportunity, lacking in many other professions, to
be measured against an objective standard. The personal desire to improve
the bottom line, that is, a company’s net profit, challenges a businessperson
in much the same way that an athlete is motivated by the quantifiable goal
of breaking a world record. The income statement is the stopwatch against
which a company runs; net profit is the corporation’s record of wins and
losses for the season.
Theanalogy between businessandathleticsextends tothefact,whichis
apparent to any close observer, that superior skills and teamwork alone do
not win championships. A baseball manager can intimidate the umpire by
heatedly protesting a call on the base paths, hoping thereby to have the next
close ruling go in his team’s favor. A corporation has the power to fire its
auditor and may use that power to influence accounting decisions that are
matters of judgment rather than clear-cut reporting standards. A baseball
team’s front office can shorten the right-field fence in its home stadium to
favor a lineup stocked with left-handed power hitters; a corporation’s man-
agement can select the accounting method that shows its results in the most
favorable light. Collectively, the team owners can urge the rules committee

all the ways that companies can manipulate the accounting rules to inflate
their earnings. Instead, the following examples should convey to the reader
the thought process involved in this rule bending. Equipped with an under-
standing of how the rule benders think, users of financial statements will be
able to detect other ruses they are sure to encounter.
Not All Sales Are Final
“Take care of the top line and the bottom line will take care of itself.” So
goes a business bromide that was popularized by Apple co-founder Steve
Jobs. It underscores the importance of revenues (the top line) to net income
(the bottom line). The point is that if a company wants to cure an earnings
problem, it should concentrate on bringing in more sales.
Generally, this is sound advice, as long as the requisite sales are brought
inbythesalesforce.Acompanycanultimatelyworsenitsoperatingtroubles
if the financial staff makes up the shortfall in revenues through accounting
gimmicks.Somerevenue-inflatingtricksareachievablewithinGAAPbound-
aries, while others clearly fall outside the law. They all produce similar ill
effects, however. Enhancements to reported sales boost reported earnings
without increasing cash flow commensurately.
Often, a company’s earnings and cash flow diverge to an extent that
becomes unsustainable. The eventual result is an abrupt adjustment to the
financial statements of previous periods. In the process, earnings and cash
flow come back into alignment, but management’s credibility plummets.
Even when no such shock occurs, the practice of pumping up revenues
through discretionary accounting decisions represents a hazard for analysts.
At a minimum, it reduces the comparability of a company’s financial
statements from one period to the next.
Additional Reasons to Be Skeptical about Revenues
Unfortunatelyforanalysts,companiesdonotalwaysspelloutinthenotesto
financial statements the means by which they have artificially inflated their
revenues. A company might lower the credit standards it applies to prospec-
tive customers without simultaneously raising the percentage of reserves it
establishes for losses on receivables. The result would be a rise in both rev-
enues and earnings in the current period, with the corresponding increase
in credit losses not becoming apparent until a later period. Alternatively, a
manufacturer may institute short-term discounts that encourage its dealers

sales and earnings will be higher in the current quarter than they would be
in the absence of the incentives, but the difference will represent merely a
shifting of revenues from a later to an earlier period. Analysts will face dis-
appointment if they extrapolate from the inflated quarterly data to project
future revenues.
Although the current-period income statement may offer no clues that
these gambits have been used, several techniques can help the analyst detect
artificial expansion of revenues. On a retrospective basis, a surge in credit
lossesoranunexpectedshortfallinrevenuesmayindicatethatrevenueswere
inflated in an earlier period with the techniques described in the preceding
paragraph.(Hindsightofthiskindisnotwithoutvalue;ananalystwhofinds
a historical pattern of hyperbolized sales at a company will be appropriately
skeptical about future income statements of that company looking surpris-
ingly strong.) On a current basis, analysts should take notice if a company
posts a substantially greater sales increase than its competitors. If discus-
sionswiththecompanyandotherindustrysourcesfailtoelicitasatisfactory
explanation (such as the introduction of a successful new product), artificial
methods may be the root of the matter. Industry sources can also provide
direct testimony about tactics being used to shift revenues from future peri-
ods to the present.

any large loss suffered by the company was somehow outside the normal

is to say, adverse events that could very well be repeated are made to seem
aberrant by people who stand to benefit from unwary analysts producing
unrealistically high earnings forecasts and thereby propelling the company
to a higher valuation than it truly deserves.
FASB’s pre-2015 rules prohibited certain items from being classified as
extraordinary:
■ Write-offs of receivables and inventories.
■ Gains or losses on foreign currency translation (even when they result
from major devaluations or revaluations).
■ Gains or losses on disposal of a segment of a business or the sale or
abandonment of property, plant, or equipment.
Because these items did not meet FASB’s standard for being character-
ized as especially far outside the normal course of business, analysts should
be particularly wary of treating them as unique events, to be ignored when
thinking about possible disruptions to future earnings. Allegedly nonrecur-
ring items have a nasty habit of recurring.

The Income Statement 65
may be able to take credit for a turnaround, based on an improvement in
earnings relative to a large loss that can be conveniently attributed to the
predecessor regime.
Even more insidiously, companies sometimes write off larger sums than
warranted by their actual economic losses on a failed business. Corporate
managers commonly perceive that the damage to their stock price will be
no greater if they take (for sake of argument) a $1.5 billion write-off than if
they write off $1.0 billion. The benefit of exaggerating the damage is that in
subsequent years, the overcharges can be reversed in small amounts that do
not generate any requirement for specific disclosure. Management can use
these gains to supplement and smooth the corporation’s bona fide operating
earnings.
The most dangerous trap that users of financial statements must avoid,
however, is inferring that the termrestructuring connotes finality. Some cor-
porations have a bad habit of remaking themselves year after year. For such
companies, the analyst’s baseline for forecasting future profitability should
be earnings after, rather than before, restructuring charges.
Procter & Gamble (P&G) is a case in point. As of April 2001, the
consumergoodscompanyhadbookedrestructuringchargesinsevenconsec-
utivequarters,aggregatingto$1.3billion.Moreover,managementindicated
thatitplannedtocontinuetakingtheseostensiblynonrecurringchargesuntil
mid-2004, ultimately charging off approximately $4 billion.
Defending its reporting, P&G said that Securities and Exchange Com-
mission (SEC) accounting rules precluded it from taking one huge charge
at the outset of the restructuring program launched in June 1999. Instead,
the company was required to record the charges in the periods in which it
actually incurred them. Granting the point, the SEC did not compel Procter
& Gamble to segregate the costs of closing factories and laying off workers
from its other operating expenses. Indeed, the arguments were stronger for
treating the charge-offs as normal costs of operating in P&G’s highly com-
petitive consumer goods business, where countless products fail or become
obsolete over time.
Abstract issues of accounting theory, however, had little impact on
brokerage house securities analysts’ treatment of P&G’s earnings record.
All 14 analysts who followed the company and submitted earnings per
share forecasts to Thomson Financial/First Call excluded the restructuring
charges from their calculations, and P&G management was bound to like
Wall Street’s interpretation of the numbers. Including all of the ostensibly
unusual gains and losses, operating income declined in all four quarters
of 2000. Leaving out all the items deemed aberrant by management, net
income rose in all quarters but the first. The latter interpretation surely

earlier unanimously chose to include in their “core net earnings” figures the
gains that Procter & Gamble classified as nonrecurring or extraordinary,
even as they excluded the extraordinary and nonrecurring losses.
A Shortcut to Higher Sales
At the same time that corporate managers have been supplementing their
traditional tactics with new adjustments to earnings, they have also concen-
trated in recent years on applying their ingenuity to revenues. This focus
is understandable in the context of huge stock market valuations for many
youngtechcompaniesthathaveyettoachievepositiveGAAPearnings.One
metric applied to such companies is the price-to-sales ratio, as opposed to
the more conventional price-to-earnings ratio. Even for more conventional
companies, reporting rapid sales growth can foster investor confidence that
impressive profit growth will follow in due course.
Amassing sales is a vital business task, but not easily achieved. Com-

ucts and generate cost savings that it can pass along to customers. Stepping
up expenditures on advertising or expanding the sales force can also lead
to increased revenues. Along with effective execution of product design or
marketing plans, however, another option exists. Management can boost
sales through techniques that qualify as corporate finance rather than sales
or marketing.
Raising the rate of revenue increases through mergers and acquisitions
is the most common example. A corporation can easily accelerate its sales
growth by buying other companies and adding their sales to its own. Cre-
ating genuine value for shareholders through acquisitions is more difficult,
although unwary investors sometimes fail to recognize the distinction.
In the fictitious example in Exhibit 3.3, Big Time Corporation’s
sales increase by 5 percent between Year 1 and Year 2. Small Change, a
smaller, privately owned company in the same industry, also achieves 5
percent year-over-year sales growth. Suppose that at the end of Year 1, Big
Time acquires Small Change with shares of its own stock. The Big Time

68 THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
income statements under this assumption (“Acquisition Scenario”) show
a 10 percent sales increase between Year 1 and Year 2. (Note that Year 1
is shown as originally reported, with Small Change still an independent
company, while in Year 2, the results of the acquired company, Small
Change, are consolidated into the parent’s financial reporting. Analysts
might also examine a pro forma income statement showing the levels of
sales, expenses, and earnings that Big Time would have achieved in Year 1,
if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of that year.)
On the face of it, a company growing at 10 percent a year is sexier than
onegrowingatonly5percentayear.Observe,however,thatBigTime’sprof-
itability, measured by net income as a percentage of sales, does not improve
as a result of the acquisition. Combining two companies with equivalent
profit margins of 3 percent produces a larger company that also earns 3
percent on sales. Shareholders do not gain anything in the process, as the
supplementary figures in Exhibit 3.3 demonstrate.
If Big Time decides not to acquire Small Change, its number of
shares outstanding remains at 75.0 million. The earnings increase from
$150.0 million in Year 1 to $157.5 million in Year 2 raises earnings per
share from $2.00 to $2.10. With the price-earnings multiple constant at 14
times, equivalent to the average of the company’s industry peers, Big Time’s
stock price rises from $28.00 to $29.40 a share.
In the Acquisition Scenario, on the other hand, Big Time pays its
industry-average earnings multiple of 14 times for Small Change, for a
total acquisition price of $7.1 million× 14 = $99.4 million. At Big Time’s
Year 1 share price of $28.00, the purchase therefore requires the issuance
of $99.4 million÷ $28.00 = 3.6 million shares. With the addition of Small
Change’snetincome,BigTimeearns$165.0millioninYear2.Dividingthat
figurebytheincreasednumberofsharesoutstanding(78.6million)produces
earnings per share of $2.10. At a price-earnings multiple of 14 times, Big
Time is worth $29.40 a share, precisely the price calculated in the Non-
acquisition Scenario. The mere increase in annual sales growth from
5percentto10percenthasnotbenefitedshareholders,whosesharesincrease

Analysts should note that this analysis is sensitive to the assumptions
underlyingthescenarios.Suppose,forinstance,thatinsteadofissuingstock,
Big Time finances the acquisition of Small Change with borrowed money.
Let us suppose that Big Time must pay interest at a rate of 4 percent on the
$99.4 million of new borrowings. Interest expense in Year 2 of the Acquisi-
tionScenarioisnow$72.0million,ratherthan$68.0million.Pretaxincome
therefore falls from $208.9 million to $204.9 million, reducing net income
from $165.0 million to $161.9 million at the company’s effective tax rate
of 21 percent. Only 75.0 million shares are outstanding at the conclusion

of the transaction, however, rather than the 78.6 million observed in the
acquisition-for-stock case. As a result, Big Time’s earnings per share rise to
$161.9 million÷ 75.0 million= $2.16.
Assuming the market continues to assign a multiple of 14 times to
Big Time’s earnings, the stock is now worth $30.24, a 3 percent increase
over the Non-acquisition Scenario. In practice, though, the investors may
reduce Big Time’s price-earnings multiple slightly to reflect the heightened
risk represented by its decreased interest coverage. (Following the for-
mulas laid out in Chapter 13, income before interest and taxes declines
from$276.9million ÷$68.0million =4.1timesinthestock-acquisitioncase
to$276.9million ÷$72.0 million= 3.8 timesinthedebt-financed-acquisition
case.) If the price-earnings multiple falls only from 14 to 13.61 times as a
result of this decline in debt protection, Big Time’s stock price in this variant
againcomesto$29.40,equivalenttotheYear2priceintheNon-acquisition
Scenario. As in the case of Big Time paying with stock for the acquisition
of Small Change, shareholders do not benefit if Big Time instead borrows
the requisite funds, assuming investors are sensitive to the impact of the
company’s increased debt load on its credit quality.
Internal versus External Growth
More important than the fine-tuning of the calculations is the principle that
a company cannot truly increase shareholders’ wealth by accelerating its
revenue growth without also improving profitability. This does not dissuade
companies from attempting to mesmerize analysts with high rates of sales
growthgeneratedbygraftingothercompanies’salesontotheirownthrough
acquisitions. Analysts may fall for the trick by failing to distinguishbetween
internal growthand external growth.
Internal growth consists of sales increases generated from a company’s
existing operations, while the latter represents incremental sales brought in
through acquisitions. An internal (or organic) growth rate greater than the
averagerecordedfortheindustryimpliesthatthecompanyisgainingmarket

On the other hand, if Company A generates external growth by acquiring
Company B and neither Company A nor its new subsidiary increases its
profitability, then the intrinsic value of the merged companies is no greater
than the sum of the two companies’ values.
External growth can increase shareholders’ wealth, however, if the
mergers and acquisitions lead to improvements in profitability. This effect

is commonly referred to assynergy. It is a term much abused by companies
thatpromisetoachieveoperatingefficiencies,withoutofferingmanyspecific
examples, through acquisitions that appear to offer few such opportunities.
Nevertheless, even analysts who have grown cynical after years of seeing
purported synergies remain unrealized will acknowledge the existence of
several bona fide means of raising a company’s profit margins through
external growth.
For one thing, a company may be able to reduce its cost per unit by
increasing the size of its purchases. Suppliers commonly offer volume dis-
counts to their large customers, which they can service more efficiently than
customers who order in small quantities. If the cost of materials, fuel, and
transportation required to produce each widget goes down while the selling
priceofwidgetsremainsunchangedinastablecompetitiveenvironment,the
company’s gross margin increases.
Another way to increase profitability through external growth involves
economies of scope. In a simple illustration, a manufacturer of potato chips
hasasalesforcecallingonretailstores.Muchoftheassociatedexpenserep-
resents the time and transportation costs incurred as the salespeople travel
from store to store, as well as the salespeople’s health insurance and other
benefits. Now suppose that the potato chip manufacturer acquires a pretzel
manufacturer. For the sake of explication, assume that the pretzel company
formerly relied on food brokers rather than an in-house sales force. The
acquiring company terminates the contracts with the brokers and adds pret-
zels to its potato chip sales force’s product line. Revenues and gross profits
per sales call rise with the addition of the pretzel line. The number of sales
calls per salesperson remains essentially constant, because taking orders for
the additional product consumes little time. Accordingly, time and trans-
portation costs per sales call do not rise materially, while the cost of health
insurance and other benefits does not rise at all. Adding it all up, the prof-
itability of selling both potato chips and pretzels through the same distribu-
tion channel is greater than the profitability of selling one snack food only.
Analysts should be forewarned that claims of potential economies of
scope often prove, in retrospect, to be exaggerated. Over a period of several
decades, for example, banks, brokerage houses, and insurance companies
havefrequentlyproclaimedtheadventofthefinancialsupermarket,inwhich

combining businesses are, the less certain it is that the hoped-for economies
of scope will be realized. When disparate companies combine in pursuit
of novel synergies, analysts should treat with extreme caution the margin
increases shown in pro forma income statements produced by management.
Capturing Economies of Scale
Finally, and perhaps most famously, mergers can genuinely increase prof-
itability and shareholder wealth through economies of scale. As illustrated
in Exhibit 3.4, Central Widget is currently utilizing only 83.3 percent of its
productive capacity. At the present production level, the company’sfixed
costs amount to $300 million÷ 250 million units= $1.20 per unit, or 12
percent of each sales dollar. These irreducible costs represent a major con-
straint on the company’s net profit margin, just 2.0 percent, and in turn its
return on equity (see Chapter 13), which is an unexciting 11.1 percent.
Central Widget spies an opportunity in the form of its smaller com-
petitor, Excelsior Widget. Because the two companies operate in the same
geographic region, it would be feasible to consolidate production in Central
Widget’s underutilized factories. Management proposes a merger premised
on achieving economies of scale.
Excelsior’s cost structure is similar to Central’s, except that its general
and administrative expense is higher as percentage of sales (6.7 percent ver-
sus 3.0 percent). The problem is that certain costs (such as the upkeep on a
headquarters building and salaries of senior executives) are nearly as great
for Excelsior as for Central, but Excelsior has a smaller base of sales over
which to spread them. As a result, Excelsior is running at a loss at current
operatinglevels.Itsboardofdirectorsthereforeacceptstheacquisitionoffer.
Central pays $23.40 worth of its own stock (0.72 shares) for each share of
Excelsior, a 30 percent premium to Excelsior’s prevailing market price.
Unlike the acquisition of Small Change by Big Time depicted in
Exhibit 3.3, this transaction not only increases the acquiring company’s
sales but also improves its profitability. Following the acquisition, on a
pro forma basis, Central Widget’s fixed cost per unit is $299.0 million÷
280 million = $1.07, down from $1.15. The net margin is up from 2.0
percent to 2.6 percent, while earnings per share have jumped from $2.50 to
$3.33, pro forma. If the market continues to assign a multiple of 13 times
to Central’s earnings, the stock should theoretically trade at $56.03, up
from $44.98 before the transaction. Realistically, that increase probably
overstates the actual rise that Central Widget shareholders can expect.
Aside from severance costs not shown in the pro forma income statement,
investors may reduce the price-earnings multiple to reflect the myriad
uncertainties faced in any merger, such as potential loss of key personnel

and the predictable traumas of melding distinct corporate cultures. After all

Scale economies become available for a variety of reasons. Technologi-
cal advances can make a sizable portion of existing capacity redundant. For

example, the advent of computerization increased the productivity of finan-
cial services workers engaged in clearing transactions.Consolidation in the
banking and brokerage industries was hastened by cost savings achievable
through handling two companies’ combined volume of transactions with
fewerbackofficeworkersthanthecompaniespreviouslyemployedinaggre-
gate. In retailing, mergers have sometimes produced savings by enabling
distribution centers to serve larger numbers of stores.
Economies of scale also arise through consolidation of a mom-and-pop
business, that is, an industry characterized by many small companies oper-
ating within limited market areas. For example, waste hauling has evolved
from a highly localized business to an industry with companies operating
on a national scale. Among the associated efficiencies is the ability to reduce
garbage trucks’ idle time by employing them in several adjacent municipali-
ties. “Rollup” consolidations of this sort have also merged large numbers of
medical practices.
Behind the Numbers: Fixed versus Variable Costs
As synergies go, projections of economies of scale in combinations of com-
panies within the same business tend to be more plausible than economies
of scope purportedly available to companies in tangentially connected busi-
nesses. The existence of chronically underutilized capacity is apparent to
operations analysts within corporations and to outside management con-
sultants. Word inevitably spreads from there until the possibility of achiev-
ing sizable efficiencies through consolidation becomes common knowledge
among investors. Companies’ published financial statements typically pro-
videtoolittledetailtodirectlyquantifythepotentialforrealizingeconomies
of scale.
Companies do not generally break out their fixed andvariable costsin
the manner shown in Exhibit 3.4. Instead, they include a combination of
variableandfixedcostsincostofgoodssold.Somewhathelpfully,theessen-
tially fixed costs of depreciation and interest appear as separate lines. On
the whole, however, a company’s published income statement provides only
limited insight into itsoperating leverage,or the rate at which net income
escalates once sales volume rises above thebreakeven rate.This is unfortu-
nate, because a breakout of fixed and variable costs would be immensely
helpful in quantifying the economies of scale potentially achievable through
a merger. More generally, such information would greatly facilitate the task
of forecasting a company’s earnings as a function of projected sales volume.
Exhibit 3.5 uses data from the Central Widget example to plot the rela-
tionship between sales volume and pretax income (income before income
taxes). The company breaks even at a sales volume of 200 million units, the

level at which the $1.50 per unitcontribution (margin of revenue over vari-
able cost) exactly offsets the $300 million of fixed costs. Once fixed costs
are covered, the contribution on each incremental unit sold flows directly
to the pretax income line. At full capacity, 300 million units, Central Wid-
get earns $150 million before taxes. (Note that analysts can alternatively
remove interest expense from the calculation and base a breakeven analysis
on operating income.)
In theory, an analyst can back out the fixed and variable components
of a company’s costs from reported sales and income data. The object is to
produce a graph along the lines of the one shown in Exhibit 3.5, while also
estimating the contribution per unit. At that point, the analyst can create a
table like that shown in the exhibit and establish the sensitivity of profits to
the portion of capacity being utilized.
Exhibit 3.6 presents the fictitious case of West Coast Whatsit. The top
graph plots the company’s reported unit sales volume versus pretax income
for each of the past 12 years. (West Coast is debt-free and has no other
nonoperating income or expenses, so the company’s operating income is
equivalenttoitspretaxincome.)Observethattheplottedpointsareconcen-

the company’s breakeven sales volume is 400 million units, that is, the point
on the diagonal line that corresponds to zero on the horizontal scale (pretax
income). Although West Coast Whatsit has not utilized 100 percent of its
capacity in any of the past 10 years, the graph indicates that at that level
(600 million on the vertical scale), pretax income would amount to $400
million.
To complete the analysis, the analyst must also plot the reported unit
sales volume versus dollar sales for the past 10 years, as shown in the lower

According to the known data, the increase in pretax income between
the breakeven volume (400 million units) and a volume of 500 million units
is $200 million. That dollar figure must represent the contribution on 100
million units. Dividing $200 million by 100 million yields the contribution
per unit of $2.00, enabling the analyst to fill in that whole column. Dividing

any figure in the sales column by its corresponding number of units (e.g.,
$2.5 billion and 500 million) provides the unit price of $5.00, which goes
oneverylineinthatcolumn.Variablecostperunit,bysubtraction,is$3.00.
Atthebreakevenlevel(pretaxincome =$0),thecontributiontotals400
million units times $2.00= $800 million. The analyst can put that number
on every line in the entire “Fixed Costs” column. All that remains is to fill
in the “Contribution” column by multiplying each remaining line’s number
of units by the $2.00 contribution per unit figure.
Regrettably, the elegant procedure just described tends to be highly
hypothetical, even though it is useful to go through the thought process. To
begin with, companies engaged in a wide range of products do not disclose
the explicit unit volume figures that the analysis requires. Relating their
sales volumes to prices and costs is more complicated than in the case of
a producer of a basic metal or a single type of paper. The management
discussion and analysis section of a multiproduct company’s financial
report may disclose period-to-period changes in unit volume, but not
absolute figures, by way of explaining fluctuations in revenues. A rise or
drop in revenue, however, may also reflect changes in the sales price per
unit, which may in turn be sensitive to industrywide variance in capacity
utilization. In addition, revenue may vary with product mix. When a
recession causes consumers to turn cautious about spending on major
appliances, for example, they may trade down to lower-priced models that
provide smaller contributions to the manufacturers. Finally, multiproduct
companies’ product lines typically change significantly over periods as long
as the 12 years assumed in Exhibit 3.6.
For all these reasons, analysts generally cannot back out fixed and vari-
able costs in practice. When projecting a company’s income statement for
the coming year, they instead work their way down to the operating income
line by making assumptions about cost of goods sold (COGS) and selling,
general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) as percentages of sales (see
Chapter 12). They try in some sense to take into account the impact of fixed
and variable costs, but they cannot be certain that their forecasts are inter-
nally consistent.
In Exhibit 3.6, total pretax costs are equivalent to the sum of COGS
and SG&A. (Remember that West Coast Whatsit has no interest expense or
other nonoperating items.) An analyst who projects that the two together
will represent 92 percent of sales is making a forecast consistent with sales
volume of 500 million units, or 83 percent of capacity. At that unit volume,
variablecoststotal500million ×$3.00=$1.5billion,whichwhenaddedto
fixedcostsof$800million,producestotalcostsof$2.3billion,or92percent
of sales measuring $2.5 billion. The assumption of a total pretax cost 92
percent ratio would be too pessimistic if the analyst actually expected West

78 THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Coast to operate in line with the whatsit industry as a whole at 90 percent
of capacity. That would imply unit sales of 540 million, resulting in variable
costs of $1.62 billion and total costs of $2.42 billion. The ratio of operating
expenses to sales of $2.7 billion (540 million units @ $5.00) would be only
90 percent. Observe that not only operating income but also the operating
margin rises as sales volume increases.
Estimating COGS and SG&A as percentages of sales is an imperfect,
albeit necessary, substitute for an analysis of fixed and variable costs.
Conscientious analysts must strive to mitigate the distortions introduced by
the shortcut method. They should avoid the trap of uncritically adopting
the projected COGS and SG&A percentages kindly provided by companies’
investor relations departments. Analysts who do so risk sacrificing their
independent judgment. After all, the preceding paragraph demonstrates
that a forecast of the operating margin must reflect an implicit assumption
about sales volume. Accordingly, a company’sguidance regarding COGS
and SG&A percentages necessarily incorporates management’s assumption
about the coming year’s sales volume. At the risk of stating the obvious,
management’s embedded sales projection will often be more optimistic than
the analyst’s independently generated forecast.
Readers should not infer from the absence of disclosure about fixed and
variable costs that the information is unimportant to understanding com-
panies’ financial performance. On the contrary, a company’s fixed-variable
mix can be a dominant factor in analyzing both its credit quality and its
equity value (see Chapters 13 and 14, respectively). A company with rela-
tively large fixed costs has a high breakeven level. Even a modest economic
downturn will reduce its capacity utilization below the rate required tokeep
the company profitable. A cost structure of this sort poses a substantial risk
of earnings falling below the level needed to cover the company’s interest
expense. On the other hand, if the same company has low variable costs,
its earnings will rise dramatically following a recession. Each incremental
unit of sales will contribute prodigiously to operating income. Two real-life
examples demonstrate the analytical company’s cost structure, even though
it may not be feasible to document the mix precisely from the financial
statements.
As an amusement park operator, Cedar Fair exemplifies the high-
fixed-cost company. Attendance (and therefore revenue) shows wide sea-
sonal variations, but the company’s costs are concentrated in categories that
do not vary with attendance. Examples include occupancy, depreciation on
rides, insurance, and wages of employees who must be on site whether the
parks are full or nearly empty.
A time series of the company’s cost of sales as a percentage of sales
(see Exhibit 3.7) shows wide quarterly fluctuations, largely reflecting

extreme seasonality in the company’s business. In 2019, for example, the
warm-weather second and third calendar quarters accounted for 78 percent
of the year’s sales. Profit margins are highest during the third quarter,
essentially the summer months. Cedar Fair generally reports losses in the
first quarter.
Archer Daniels Midland (see Exhibit 3.8) represents the opposite
extreme of cost structures. Seasonality is not a material factor for the food
processor and commodities trader, as demand for its products is steady.
In the five-year period depicted in Exhibit 3.8, ADM’s cost of goods sold
as a percentage of sales never strayed outside the range of 92 percent
to 95 percent. The ratio remained inside those bounds even during the
pandemic-wracked, recession year of 2020.
Notwithstanding the generally stable pattern of margins depicted in
Exhibit 3.8, Archer Daniels Midland experienced a sharp earnings drop-off
in 2016. Net income as a percentage of sales fell from 2.73 percent to 2.05
percent and basic earnings per share from continuing operations fell by 27
percent. Contributing factors included compressed grain handling margins
in the first half of the year, low market volatility that limited forward
merchandising opportunities, weak barge demand and lower freight rates in

soybean and corn crops than in 2015.
Those results demonstrate that even in a business with built-in safe-
guards against wide period-to-period swings, events beyond management’s
control may periodically cut down the bottom line. Even so, credit analysts
generally perceive greater risk in the pattern exemplified by Cedar Fair. For
highlyseasonalcompanies,classicallyrepresentedbytoymanufacturersand
general merchandisers, a lackluster winter holiday sales season can drive
operating income below the level required to cover interest expense.
Playing with Price-Earnings Multiples Vigilance, as exemplified by the need to
watch for earnings discontinuities, has been a recurring theme throughout
this exploration of the ins and outs of income statements. Other pitfalls to
watchout forinclude unrealizable synergies and company-furnished projec-
tions of cost ratios that incorporate management’s assumptions regarding
sales volume. Before moving on, vigilant analysts should familiarize them-
selves with a device that companies have developed to get around the gen-
eral proposition that mergers do not increase value unless they increase
profitability.
Turning back to the fictitious acquisition case presented in Exhibit 3.3,
let us change one assumption (see Exhibit 3.9). As a comparatively small
company within its industry, Small Change probably will not command as
highaprice-earningsmultipleasitslargerindustrypeers.Therefore,weshall
assume that Big Time is able to acquire the company for only 12 times earn-
ings, rather than 14 times, as assumed in Exhibit 3.3.

82 THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our revised assumption does not alter the income statements in
either year under either the Acquisition Scenario or the Non-acquisition
Scenario. The acquisition price, however, falls from $99.4 million to $7.1
million×12=$85.2million.BigTimeissuesonly$85.2million ÷$28.00=
3.0 million shares to pay for the acquisition, rather than 3.6 million under
the previous assumption. Consequently, Big Time has 78.0 million shares
outstanding at the end of Year 2 under the Acquisition Scenario, instead of
78.6 million. Earnings per share come to $165.0 million÷ 78.0 million=
$2.12. At a price-earnings multiple of 14 times, Big Time’s stock is valued
at $29.68 a share following the Small Change acquisition, slightly higher
than the $29.40 figure shown in the Non-acquisition Scenario. Big Time
could vault its share price to a considerably loftier level by making a series
of acquisitions on a similar basis.
In contrast to the outcome depicted in Exhibit 3.3, Big Time increases
thevalueofitsstockthroughtheacquisitionofSmallChange.Thecompany
achieves this effect without realizing operating efficiencies through the com-
bination. Following the transaction, Big Time’s ratio of net income to sales
is 3 percent, unchanged from its preacquisition level.
The rational explanation of this apparent alchemy lies in Big Time’s
ability to exchange its stock for shares of privately owned Small Change
on highly favorable terms. By acquiring the smaller company at a price of
12 times earnings with stock valued at a multiple of 14 times, Big Time
spreads Small Change’s earnings across fewer shares than would be the case
if the market valued the two companies at the same multiple. The effect,
achieved purely through financial engineering, is a parody of the economies
ofscalerealizedinmergerspremisedinsteadonimprovementsinoperations.
In fairness to the many real-world companies that have exploited
disparities in price-earnings multiples over the years, Big Time’s
share-price-enhancing acquisition rests squarely within the bounds of
fair play. Companies legitimately take advantage of favorable currency
exchange rates when deciding whether to purchase materials and equip-
ment domestically or overseas. If the dollar is high relative to the euro,
companies based in the United States can source goods more economically
in Europe than at home. In principle, it is no less appropriate or beneficial
to shareholders to buy earnings with a highly valued acquisition currency,
that is, its own stock.
Furthermore, as shareholders of a private company, Small Change’s
owners do not have to be coerced to sell out to Big Time. The disparity
in price-earnings multiples is justified by the private company’s owners’
opportunity to exchange an illiquid investment for public stock, for which
a deep and active trading market exists. If anything, the difference between
Big Time’s multiple of 14 times and Small Change’s 12 times understates the

The Income Statement 83
valuation gap between the public and private shares. Lacking a secondary
market that would reward higher reported income with a higher share
price, private owner-managers commonly extract compensation through
perquisites that their companies can lawfully account for as business
expenses. The result is lower net income than comparably successful public
companies would report, but with the value of the perks delivered on
a pretax basis. Instead of buying cars with dividends distributed from
after-tax income, the owner-managers can drive fancier, more expensive
company-provided cars purchased with pretax dollars. After adjusting
Small Change’s reported income for expenses that would not be incurred
at a public company such as Big Time, the $85.2 million acquisition price
might represent a multiple of only 10 or 11 times, rather than 12 times.
In short, there is nothing inherently unsavory about paying for
low-multiple companies with high-multiple stock. Why, then, does the
technique warrant special focus in a chapter covering the broad subject of
income statements? The answer is that like many other legitimate financial
practices,exploitingdisparitiesinprice-earningsmultiplesispronetoabuse.
Capitalizing on disparities in price-earnings multiples can lead to trouble in
several ways.
Tobeginwith,supposeahigh-multiplecompanyacquiresalow-multiple
company during a period of exceptionally wide dispersion in valuations. In
a shift from normal conditions to a two-tiered market, the respective mul-
tiples might go, for the sake of example, from 15 and 12 to 25 and 10.
Selling stockholders of the low-multiple company would probably consider
it a fair exchange to accept payment in shares of the high-multiple com-
pany at the prevailing market price. Their feelings would probably change
dramatically,however,ifthetwo-tieredmarketabruptlyendedwiththepur-
chaser’s stock receding from 25 times earnings to a more ordinary 15 times.
Sellers who retained the acquiring company’s shares would discover that
their value received had suddenly fallen by 40 percent. (It is reasonable to
assume that many shareholders would have held on to the shares, because
doing so would ordinarily delay the incurrence of capital gains taxes on the
sale. Unlike cash-for-stock transactions, stock-for-stock acquisitions gener-
ally qualify as tax-free exchanges.)
Readers might accuse the selling shareholders of being crybabies. After
all, they knew when they accepted the acquiring company’s shares as pay-
mentthattheywouldbeexposedtostockmarketfluctuations,muchasthey
were prior to the deal. The difference, however, is that if they had held on
to their low-multiple stock, their loss would not have been 40 percent, but
only 17 percent; that is, from 12 times to 10 times earnings. (A complete
comparison must also take into account any premium over the previously
prevailing stock price received by the selling shareholders.)

84 THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Financial statement analysis would not have warned the selling share-
holders of the impending marketwide drop in price-earnings (P/E) multi-
ples. Careful scrutiny of the acquiring company’s income statement might
very well have determined, however, that its shares were susceptible to a
sharp decline. Over the years, many voracious acquirers have temporarily
achievedstratosphericmultiplesontheiracquisitioncurrencythroughfinan-
cial reporting gimmicks that hard-nosed analysts were able to detect before
the share prices fell back to earth.
In some instances, the basis for an exaggerated P/E multiple is rapid
earnings per share (EPS) growth achieved through financial engineering
ratherthanbonafidesynergies.Startingwithamodestmultipleonitsstock,
a company can make a few small acquisitions of low-multiple companies to
get the earnings acceleration started. Each transaction may be too small
to be deemed material in itself. That would eliminate any obligation on the
company’s part to divulge details that would make it easy for analysts to
quantify the impact of the company’s exploitation of disparities in P/E
multiples. As quarter-to-quarter percentage increases in EPS escalate, the
company’s equity begins to be perceived as a high-growth glamour stock.
Obliging investors award the stock a higher multiple, which increases the
company’s ability to buy earnings on favorable terms. Management may
succeed in pumping up the P/E multiple even further by asserting that it can
achieve economies of scope through acquiring enterprises outside, yet in
some previously unrecognized way, complementary to the company’s core
business.
The conglomerate craze of the 1960s relied heavily on these techniques,
and with variations, they have been reused in more recent times. Massive
declines in the share prices of the insatiable acquirers’ stock prices have
frequently resulted. Contributing to the downslides have been the practi-
cal problems of integrating the operations of diverse companies. Deals that
work on paper have often foundered on incompatible information systems,
disparate distribution channels, clashes of personality among senior execu-
tives,andcontrastingcorporatecultures.Inaddition,theprocessofboosting
earnings per share through acquisition of lower-multiple companies may
prove unsustainable. For example, if competition heats up among corpo-
rations seeking to grow through acquisition, the P/E gap between acquirers
and target companies may narrow. That could get in the way of the contin-
uous stream of acquisitions needed to maintain EPS growth in the absence
of profit improvements. Inevitably, too, the voracious acquirer will suffer a
normal cyclical decline in the earnings of its existing operations. The com-
pany’s price-earnings multiple may then decline relative to the multiples of
its potential targets, interrupting the necessary flow of acquisitions.

The Income Statement 85
It is no small task to dissect the income statement of a corporation that
makes frequent acquisitions and discloses as few details as possible. Never-
theless, an energetic analyst can go a long way toward segregating ongoing
operations from purchased earnings growth. Acquisitions of public compa-
niesleaveaninformationtrailintheformofregulatoryfilings.Conscientious
searching of the media, including the industry-specialized periodicals and
local newspapers, may yield useful tidbits on acquisitions of private com-
panies. Such investigations will frequently turn up the phrase “terms of the
acquisition were not disclosed,” but reliable sources may provide informed
speculation about the prices paid. Finally, the acquirers may furnish general
information regarding the range of earnings multiples paid in recent deals.
If an analysis of the available data indicates that management is expanding
its empire without creating additional value through genuine economies of
scale or scope, the prudent action is to sell before the bottom falls out.
CONCLUSION
At several points in this chapter, analysis of the income statement has posed
questions that could be answered only by looking outside the statement.
Mere study of reported financial figures never leads to a fully informed
judgment about the issuer. Financial statements cannot capture certain non-
quantitative factors that may be essential to an evaluation. These include
industry conditions, corporate culture, and management’s ability to antici-
pate change and respond effectively.

CHAPTER 4
The Statement of Cash Flows
T
he present version of the financial statement that traces the flow of funds
in and out of the firm, the statement of cash flows, became mandatory,
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) 95, for issuers
with fiscal years ending after July 15, 1988. Exhibit 4.1, the 2019 cash
flow statement of Motorola Solutions, illustrates the statement’s division
into cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing
activities. The predecessor of the statement of cash flows, the statement of
changes in financial position, was first required under Accounting Principles
Board (APB) opinion 19, in 1971.
Prior to 1971, going as far back as the introduction ofdouble-entry
bookkeepinginItalyduringthefifteenthcentury,financialanalystshadmud-
dled through with only the balance sheet and the income statement. Anyone
with a sense of history will surely conclude that the introduction of the cash
flow statement must have been premised by expectations of great new ana-
lyticalinsights.Suchaninferenceisinfactwellfounded.Theadvantagesofa
cashflowstatementcorrespondtotheshortcomingsoftheincomestatement
and, more specifically, the concept of profit. Over time, profit has proven so
malleable a quantity, so easily enlarged or reduced to suit management’s
needs, as to make it useless, in many instances, as the basis of a fair compar-
ison among companies.
An example of the erroneous comparisons that can arise involves the
contrasting objectives that public and private companies have in preparing
their income statements.
For financial-reporting (as opposed to tax-accounting) purposes, a pub-
licly owned company generally seeks to maximize its reported net income,
which investors use as a basis for valuing its shares. Therefore, its incentive
in any situation where the accounting rules permit discretion is to minimize
expenses. The firm will capitalize whatever expenditures it can and depre-
ciate its fixed assets over as long a period as possible. All that restrains the
public company in this respect (other than conscience) is the wish to avoid

a lower market valuation of its reported earnings. Using depreciation sched-
ules much longer than those of other companies in the same industry could
give rise to such a perception.
In contrast, a privately held company has no public shareholders to
impress. Unlike a public company, which shows one set of statements
to the public and another to the Internal Revenue Service, a private
company typically prepares one set of statements, with the tax authorities
foremost in its thinking. Its incentive is not to maximize, but to minimize
the income it reports, thereby minimizing its tax bill as well. If an analyst
examines its income statement and tries to compare it with those of public
companies in the same industry, the result will be an undeservedly poor
showing by the private company.

92 THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
by putting up a comparatively small amount of equity and borrowing the
balance (70 percent in this example) of the purchase price. As a result of
this highly leveraged capital structure, interest expense is so large that the
formerly quite profitable company reports a reduced net income in its first
year as an LBO (2020). Hardly an attractive investment, on the face of it,
and one might also question the wisdom of lenders who provide funds to
an enterprise that is assured of becoming less profitable.
A closer study, however, shows that the equity investors are no fools.
In 2020, the company’s sales are expected to bring in $1,543 million in
cash. Cash outlays include cost of sales ($864 million); selling, general, and
administrative expense ($309 million); and interest expense ($71 million),
for a total of $1,244 million. Adding in depreciation of $108 million pro-
duces total expenses of $1,352 million, which when subtracted from sales
results in a $191 million pretax profit. The amount attributable to depre-
ciation, however, does not represent an outlay of cash in the current year.
Rather, it is a bookkeeping entry intended to represent the gradual reduc-
tion in value, through use, of physical assets. Therefore, the funds generated
by the leveraged buyout firm equal sales less the cash expenses only. (Note
that the assumed tax rate in this projection is 21 percent.)
Viewed in terms of cash inflows and outflows, rather than earnings, the
leveraged buyout begins to look like a sound venture. In 2024, net income
has increased by only 8 percent since 2020, despite a 26 percent advance in
sales, but the company is generating cash and has reduced its borrowings.
(Note that in this illustration, the equity investors take no dividends but
instead dedicate any surplus cash generated to debt reduction.)
The story improves further in subsequent years. As sales grow at an
8 percent annual rate, the projected income statement shows a steady
increase in operating income. In addition, the paydown of debt causes inter-
est expense to decline, so net income increases over time. With depreciation
rising as well, funds from operations in this example keep ahead of the
growing capital expenditure requirements.
If the projections prove accurate, the equity investors will, by the end of
2024, own a company with $2.1 billion in sales and $357 million of oper-
ating income, up from $1.4 billion and $243 million, respectively, in 2019.
They will have captured that growth without having injected any additional
cash beyond their original $600 million investment.
Suppose the investors then decide to monetize the increase in firm
value represented by the growth in earnings. Assuming they can sell the
company for the same multiple of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,

94 THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
oftheLBOproposalwouldmissthepointiftheyfocusedonearningsrather
than cash flow.
The same emphasis on cash flow, rather than reported earnings, is
equally important in analyzing the downside in a leveraged buyout.
As one might expect, the equity investors do not reap such spectacu-
lar gains without taking substantial risk. There is a danger that everything
will not go according to plan and that they will lose their entire investment.
Specifically, there is a risk that sales and operating earnings will fall short
of expectations, perhaps as a result of a recession or because the investors’
expectations were unrealistically high at the outset. With a less debt-heavy
capital structure, a shortfall in operating earnings might not be worrisome.
In a leveraged buyout, however, the high interest expense can quickly turn
disappointing operating income into a sizable net loss (Exhibit 4.3). The
loss may be so large that even after depreciation is added back, the com-
pany’s funds generated from operations may decline to zero or to a negative
figure. (Note that the shortfall shown here resulted from a 10 percent drop
in sales from 2019 and deviations of just 10 percent each in the projections
for cost of sales, and selling, general, and administrative expense, shown in
Exhibit 4.2.)

if they cannot cut costs sufficiently, are unappealing. One option is for the
investors to inject more equity into the company. This will cause any profits
they ultimately realize to represent a smaller percentage return on the equity
invested, besides possibly straining the investors’ finances. Alternatively, the
existingequityholderscansellequitytoanewgroupofinvestors.Thedisad-
vantage of this strategy is that anyone putting in new capital at a time when
the venture is perceived to be in trouble is likely to exact terms that will
severely dilute the original investors’ interest and, possibly, control. Compa-
rably harsh terms may be expected from lenders who are willing (if any are)
to let the company try to borrow its way out of its problems. A distressed
exchangeoffer,inwhichbondholdersacceptreducedinterestorapostpone-
ment of principal repayment, may be more attractive for the equity holders
but is likely to meet stiff resistance.
If all these options prove unpalatable or infeasible, the leveraged com-

bankruptcy, which could result in a total loss for the equity investors. Alter-
natively,thelendersmayagreetoreducetheinterestratesontheirloansand
postpone mandatory principal repayments, but they will ordinarily agree to
such concessions only in exchange for a larger say in the company’s man-
agement. In short, once cash flow turns negative, the potential outcomes
generally look bleak to the equity investors.
The key point here is that the cash flow statement, rather than the
income statement, provides the best information about a highly leveraged
firm’s financial health. Given the overriding importance of generating (and
retaining) cash to retire debt, and because the equity investors do not seek
dividends, there is no advantage in showing an accounting profit, the main
consequence of which is incurrence of taxes, resulting in turn in reduced
cash flow. Neither are there public shareholders clamoring for increases
in earnings per share. The cash flow statement is the most useful tool for
analyzing highly leveraged companies because it reflects the true motivation
of the firm’s owners− to generate cash, rather than to maximize reported
income.
ANAL YTICAL APPLICATIONS
Although privately held and highly leveraged companies illustrate most
vividly the advantages of the cash flow statement, the statement also has
considerable utility in analyzing publicly owned and more conventionally
capitalized firms. One important application lies in determining where a
company is in its life cycle, that is, whether it is taking off, growing rapidly,
maturing, or declining. Different types of risk characterize these various

stages of the life cycle. Therefore, knowing which stage a company is in
can focus the analyst’s efforts on the key analytical factors. A second use of
the cash flow statement is to assess a company’sfinancial flexibility.T h i s
term refers to a company’s capacity, in the event of a business downturn, to
continue making expenditures that, over the long term, minimize its cost of
capitalandenhanceitscompetitiveposition.Finally,thecashflowstatement
is the key statement to examine when analyzing a troubled company. When
a company is verging on bankruptcy, its balance sheet may overstate its
asset value, as a result of write-offs having lagged the deterioration in
profitability of the company’s operations. On the other hand, the balance
sheet may fail to reflect the full value of certain assets recorded at historical
cost, which the company might sell to raise cash. The income statement
is not especially relevant in the context of pending bankruptcy. For the
moment, the company’s key objective is not to maintain an impeccable
earnings record, but to survive. The cash flow statement provides the most
useful information for answering the critical question: Will the company
succeed in keeping its creditors at bay?
Cash Flows and the Company Life Cycle
Business enterprises typically go through phases of development that are in
many respects analogous to a human being’s stages of life. Just as children
are susceptible to illnesses different from those that afflict the elderly, the
risks of investing in young companies are different from the risks inherent
in mature companies. Accordingly, it is helpful to understand which portion
of the life cycle a company is in and which financial pitfalls it is therefore
most likely to face.
Revenues build gradually in the introductory phase, when the company
is just organizing itself and launching its products. From a small base, rev-
enuesacceleraterapidlyduringthegrowthphase,asthecompany’sproducts
penetrate the market and production reaches a profitable scale. In the matu-
rity phase, sales opportunities are limited to the replacement of products
previously sold, plus new sales derived from growth in the population. Price
competition often intensifies at this stage, as companies seek sales growth
through increased market share (a larger piece of a pie that is growing at
a lesser rate). The decline stage does not automatically follow maturity,
but over long periods, some industries do get swept away by technological
change. Sharply falling sales and earnings, ultimately resulting in corporate
bankruptcies, characterize industries in severe decline.

curve peaks in the earlier (introductory-growth) portion of the life cycle,
while the operating and investing curves peak in the later (maturity-decline)
portion. A crossover occurs in the maturity phase as cash flows from oper-
ating and investing begin to exceed cash flows from financing.
Introductory stage companies subsist primarily on financing as they
build their operations toward the point at which they will begin to generate
cash. Growth companies can be highly profitable, but they require extensive
external capital to keepfunding their expansion. Mature companies may
achieve less impressive profit margins, but as their need to invest levels off,
they become self-funding and, ultimately, net generators of cash. This is
indicated in the graph by the financing curve falling into negative territory.
Companies that throw off cash can be good leveraged buyout candidates.
Alternatively, they may seek to bolster profits through industry consolida-
tion (i.e., mergers and acquisitions that reduce the number of competitors)
to achieve economies of scale. Declining companies reach a point at which
deteriorating cash flows from operating and investing activities cause them
to become net cash users. They cannot fill the gap with external financing
(as shown by the financing curve moving into the negative zone), because
they represent poor credit risks and offer unattractive returns to equity
investors.

pany in the introductory phase of its life cycle (Exhibit 4.5). This biotech

company, founded in 2014, engages in research and clinical development of
gene editing therapies for patients with genetically based diseases. The com-
pany was privately owned during the initial period shown in the exhibit,
going public only in May 2016.
Intellia recorded negative net income throughout the period shown.
Book losses are not unusual for companies at the introductory stage. In
the case of capital-intensive manufacturing companies, it may take several
years for sales to reach a level sufficient to cover the substantial fixed costs
that are essential to operations.
During the period shown in Exhibit 4.5, Intellia was at a relatively early
stage of developing therapies from its CRISPR gene editing technology. As
lateas2019,thecompany’sresearchanddevelopmentexpensewas2.5times
its revenue. The profits and cash flow from operations sought by sharehold-
ers were still to come, keeping Intellia dependent on raising outside funds.
Afteritsinitialpublicofferingthecompanycontinuedtoraisecashfrom
common stock offerings in 2017, 2018, and 2019. In those years, the com-
pany had modest expenditures for property and equipment. Much of the
cash raised by the stock offerings was used in the purchase and sale of mar-
ketable securities, likely in anticipation of negative operating cash flow.
Carvana (Exhibit 4.6) is an example of a rapidly growing company
that has emerged from its introductory phase. It was founded in 2012 as
an e-commerce platform that buys and sells used cars. The company went
public in 2015 and over the five years depicted in the cash flow statements

year-to-yearsalesincreasesderivefromrisingpopularityofitsservice,rather
than mere population growth, as is the case with a mature company.
As Carvana’s sales grew, so did its reported losses, leading to increas-
ingly negative cash flow from operating activities. (In an illustration of the
weakening link between GAAP income and equity valuations discussed in
Chapter5,investorsawardedCarvanaa marketcapitalization of$14billion
asoftheendoffiscal2019.)Investingactivities,primarilypurchasesofprop-
erty and equipment, rendered cash flow even more negative before taking
into account financing activities. In 2015–2017 Carvana financed its grow-
ing operations mainly with a floor plan facility, which consists of short-term
loans provided to a big-ticket retailer by a traditional bank, specialty lender,
or finance arms of a manufacturer and then repaid as the inventoried items
are sold. As the scale of operations grew, the company relied mostly on
revolving credit, long-term debt, and equity offerings.

pany in the decline phase of its life cycle. Founded in 1984 as Research in
Motion (RIM), this Canadian company enjoyed huge success as the early
leader in smartphones. Even after Apple introduced its first iPhone in 2007,

Losses in fiscal years 2020 and 2021 put the company in the red for the
full period. Net cash provided by operating activities dropped off sharply
after fiscal 2018. BlackBerry’s business does not require substantial capital
spending (“Acquisition of property, plant and equipment”). Nevertheless,
thecompany’s cashbalance declinedatarateof$212millionayearinfiscal
years 2019–2021.
Note that business setbacks do not always evolve into downward spi-
raling cash flows. As detailed in Exhibit 4.9a, in 2015 Microsoft suffered a
largest-ever quarterly loss. A year earlier the company had acquired Nokia’s
handsetunitinanattempttoturnarounditsownmoney-losingsmartphone
business. The deal did little to gain ground with mobile phone users, how-
ever, and Microsoft wrote off most of the purchase cost of the acquisition.
In addition to that non-cash charge, the company incurred large restructur-
ingcostsassociatedwithterminating7,800employeesandotherintegration

Net cash from operations declined in fiscal 2015. As shown in
Exhibit 4.9b, however, that performance measure rebounded strongly in
fiscal 2016 and grew strongly in each of the subsequent three years. This

experience highlights an important point about financial forecasting: It is
essential to analyze a company’s business prospects, rather than simply
extrapolate recent results and account for the business cycle.
The Concept of Financial Flexibility
Besides reflecting a company’s stage of development, and therefore the cat-
egories of risk it is most likely to face, the cash flow statement provides
essentialinformationaboutafirm’sfinancialflexibility.Bystudyingthestate-
ment, an analyst can make informed judgments on such questions as:
■ How safe (likely to continue being paid) is the company’s dividend?
■ Couldthecompanyfunditsneedsinternallyifexternalsourcesofcapital
suddenly become scarce or prohibitively expensive?
■ Would the company be able to continue meeting its obligations if its
business turned down sharply?
Exhibit 4.10 provides a condensed format that can help answer these
questions. At the top is basic cash flow, defined as net income (excluding
noncashcomponents),depreciation,anddeferredincometaxes.Thisformat
helps the analyst quantify the company’s capacity fordiscretionary outlays.
In difficult times, when a company must cut back on various expen-
ditures to conserve cash, management faces many difficult choices. A key

objective is to avoid damage to the company’s long-term health. Financial
flexibility is critical to meeting this objective.
Walmart,theworld’slargestretailer,exhibitedexceptionalfinancialflex-
ibility in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019. Cash generated by oper-
ations, at a robust $27.8 billion, easily covered the company’s ambitious
$10.3billioncapitalspendingprogram.Internallygeneratedfundsalsocov-
ered the company’s $6.1 billion of dividends, which, as discussed below,
represent an expenditure made at the board’s discretion.
Even after those uses, Walmart generated $11.3 billion of cash that was
available for $7.4 billion of stock repurchases. Walmart had the flexibility
to make that highly discretionary outlay because it was self-sufficient with
respect to its non-discretionary expenditures. The company needed external
funding, in the form of debt, mainly because it chose to make $14.7 billion
of acquisitions.
Walmart’s ability to self-finance itsorganic growthconstitutes a huge
competitive advantage. At times, new financing becomes painfully expen-
sive,asafunctionofhighinterestratesordepressedstockprices.Duringthe
credit crunches that occasionally befall the business world, external financ-
ing is unavailable at any price.
Underlying Walmart’s lack of dependence on external funds is a highly
profitable discount store business. If this engine were to slow down for
a time, as a result of an economic contraction or increased competitive
pressures, the company would have two choices. It could reduce its rate of
store additions and profit-enhancing investments in technology, or it could
become more dependent on external financing. The former approach could
further impair profitability, while the latter option would earmark a greater
portion of Walmart’s EBITDA for interest and dividends, meaning less
would be available for investments to maintain or enhance competitiveness.
Loss of financial flexibility, in short, leads to further loss of financial
flexibility.
If a corporation’s financial strain becomes acute, the board of directors
may take the comparatively extreme step of cutting or eliminating the
dividend. (About the only measures more extreme than elimination of
the dividend are severe retrenchment, entailing a sell-off of core assets to
generate cash, and cessation of interest payments, or default.) Reducing
the dividend is a step that corporations try very hard to avoid, for fear of
losing favor with investors and consequently suffering an increase in cost
of capital. Boards sometimes go so far as to borrow to maintain a dividend
at its existing rate. This tactic cannot continue over an extended period,
lest interest costs rise while internal cash generation stagnates, ultimately
leading to insolvency.

120 THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notwithstandingthelengthstowhichcorporationssometimesgotopre-
serve dividends, reducing the dividend must be viewed as a potential means
of maintaining financial flexibility in a period of depressed earnings. After
all, the termdiscretionary,applied to the cash flow that remains available
afteroperatingexpensesandcapitalexpenditures,emphasizesthatdividends
are not contractual payments, but disbursed at the board’s discretion. When
preservation of the dividend jeopardizes a company’s financial well-being,
shareholders may actually urge the board to cut thepayout as a means of
enhancing the stock value over the longer term.
To gauge the safety of the dividend, analysts can calculate the margin
by which discretionary cash flow covers it. In Walmart’s case, the ratio is a
comfortable $16.971 billion÷ $6.102 billion= 2.78×. In fact, if Walmart
had earned zero profit for the year, its discretionary cash flow still would
have more than sufficed to make the intended dividend payment.
Walmart’sdegreeoffinancialflexibilityisexceptional.Asignificantdrop
inthenetincomeofmanyothercompanieswouldreducetheirdiscretionary
cash flow below the level of planned dividend payments. These companies
typically have an additional cushion, however, in the form of potential cut-
backs in their capital budgets. A retailer could not only reduce the pace
of store additions but also defer planned refurbishment of existing stores.
The latter measure, though, could cut into future competitiveness. Retail-
ers find that their sales drop off if their stores start to look tired. Simi-
larly, an industrial company can lose its competitive edge if it drops back
to maintenance-level capital spending for any extended period. This is the
amount required just to keep existing plant and equipment in good working
order, with no expenditures for adding to capacity or modernizing facili-
ties to enhance productivity. Incidentally, analysts should seek independent
confirmation of the figure that management cites as the maintenance level,
possibly from an engineer familiar with the business. Companies may exag-
gerate the extent to which they can reduce capital spending to conserve cash
in the event of a downturn.

working capital. Unlike conventional working capital (current assets minus
current liabilities), this figure excludes notes payable, as well as cash and
short-term investments. A company’s inventories and receivables generally

much of that cash need by increasing its trade payables (credit extended
by vendors). External financing may be required, however, if accumulation
of unsold goods causes inventories to rise disproportionately to sales.
Similarly, if customers begin paying more slowly than formerly, receivables
can widen the gap between working capital requirements and trade credit
availability.

The Statement of Cash Flows 121
The resulting deterioration in credit quality measures (see Chapter 13),
in turn, may cause vendors to reduce the amount of credit they are will-
ing to provide. Once again, loss of financial flexibility can feed on itself.
Exhibit 4.10 shows that Walmart was well insulated against such problems
in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019. The company generated $295
million of cash by increasing accounts payable and other short-term liabili-
ties by more than the amount by which accounts receivable and inventories
grew to support sales growth.
IN DEFENSE OF SLACK
Conditionsaretoughenoughwhencreditisscarce,eitherbecauseofgeneral
conditions in the financial markets or as a result of deterioration in a com-
pany’s debt quality measures. Sometimes the situation is much worse, as a
company finds itself actually prohibited from borrowing. Bank credit agree-
ments typically impose restrictive covenants, which may include limitations
on total indebtedness (see “Projecting Financial Flexibility” in Chapter 12).
Beyond a certain point, a firm bound by such covenants cannot continue
borrowing to meet its obligations.
A typical consequence of violating debt covenants or striving to head
off bankruptcy is that management reduces discretionary expenditures to
avoidlosingcontrol.Manyitemsthatacompanycancutwithoutdisrupting
operations in the short run are essential to its long-term health. Advertising
and research are obvious targets for cutbacks. Their benefits are visible only
in future periods, while their costs are apparent in the current period. Over
many years, a company that habitually scrimps on such expenditures can
impair its competitiveness, thereby transforming a short-term problem into
a long-term one.
Avoiding this pattern of decline is the primary benefit of financial flexi-
bility.Ifduringgoodtimesacompanycangeneratepositivecashflowbefore

122 THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
shareholders. The only alternative is to invest it in low-return projects (or
possibly even lower-return marketable securities), thereby preventing share-
holders from earning fair returns on a portion of their capital. Left to their
own devices, argue the proponents of this view, managers will trap cash in
low-return investments because their compensation tends to be positively
related to the growth of assets under their control. Therefore, management
should be encouraged to remit all excess cash to shareholders. If encourage-
ment fails to do the trick, the threat ofhostile takeovershould be employed,
say those who minimize the value of financial flexibility.
The argument against retaining excess cash flow certainly sounds logi-
cal. It is supported, moreover, by numerous studies4 indicating the tendency
ofcompaniestocontinueinvestingevenaftertheyhaveexhaustedtheirgood
opportunities. Growing as it does out of economic theory, though, the argu-
ment must be applied judiciously in practice. Overinvestment has unques-
tionablyled,inmanyindustries,toprolongedperiodsofexcesscapacity,pro-
ducinginturnchronicallypoorprofitability.Inretrospect,thefirmsinvolved
would have served their shareholders better if they had increased their divi-
dendpayoutsorrepurchasedstock,insteadofconstructingnewplants.That
judgment, however, benefits from hindsight. Managers may have overin-
vested because they believed forecasts of economic growth that ultimately
proved too optimistic. Had demand grown at the expected rate, a firm that
had declined to expand capacity might have been unable to maintain its
market share. In the long run, failing to keep up with the scale economies
achieved by more expansion-minded competitors could have harmed share-
holders more than a few years of excess capacity. The financial analyst’s job
includes making judgments about a firm’s reinvestment policies – without
the benefit of hindsight – and does not consist of passively accepting the
prevailing wisdom that low returns in the near term prove that an industry
has no future opportunities worth exploiting.
A subtler point not easily captured by theorists is that financial flexibil-
ity can translate directly into operating flexibility. Keeping cash trapped in
marketable securities can enable a firm to gain an edge over lean-and-mean
competitors when tight credit conditions make it difficult to finance work-
ing capital needs. Another less obvious risk of eschewing financial flexibility
is the danger of permanently losing experienced skilled workers through
temporary layoffs occasioned by recessions. Productivity suffers during the
subsequent recovery as a consequence of laid-off skilled employees find-
ing permanent jobs elsewhere. It may therefore be economical to continue
to run plants, thereby deliberately building up inventory, to keep valued
workers on the payroll. This strategy is difficult to implement without some
capability of adjusting to a sudden increase in working capital financing

The Statement of Cash Flows 123
CONCLUSION
Over the past five decades, the statement of cash flows has become a valu-
able complement to the other statements. It is invaluable in many situations
where the balance sheet and income statement provide only limited insight.
For example, the income statement is a dubious measure of the success of
a highly leveraged company that is being managed to minimize, rather than
maximize, reported profits. Similarly, it is largely irrelevant whether the bal-
ance sheet of a company with an already substantially depleted net worth
shows 10 percent lower equity in the current quarter than in the previous
one.Theprimaryconcernoftheinvestororcreditoratsuchtimesiswhether
the company can buy enough time to solve its operating problems by con-
tinuing to meet its near-term obligations.
The cash flow statement does more than enrich the analysis of com-
panies encountering risks and opportunities that the income statement and
balancesheetarenotdesignedtoportray.Italsohelpstoidentifythelifecycle
categories into which companies fit. At all stages of development, financial
flexibility is essential to meeting the types of challenges that typically arise.
Thecashflowstatementisthebesttoolformeasuringflexibility,which,con-
trary to a widely held view, is not merely a security blanket for squeamish
investors. In the hands of aggressive but prudent management, a cash flow
cushion can enable a company to sustain essential long-term investment
spending when competitors are forced to cut back.

CHAPTER 5
What Is Proﬁt?
P
rofits hold an exalted place in the business world and in economic the-
ory. The necessity of producing profits imposes order and discipline on
business organizations. It fosters cost-reducing innovations, which in turn
promote the efficient use of scarce resources. The profit motive also encour-
ages savings and risk taking, two indispensable elements of economic devel-
opment. Finally, profitability is a yardstick by which businesspeople can
measure their achievements and justify their claims to compensation.
In view of all these essential economic functions, one might suppose
that users of financial statements would have long since devised a univer-
sally agreed-upon definition of profit. This is the case, however, only at the
following, extremely rudimentary level:
Profit = Revenue− Costs
Defining profit in such a manner merely stirs up questions, however:
What is revenue? Which costs count? Or, more precisely, which costs count
now, and which count later? Because these questions can be answered in
many different ways, countless definitions of profit are in common use. For
analysts of financial statements, the most important distinction to under-
stand is between bona fide profits and accounting profits.
BONA FIDE PROFITS VERSUS ACCOUNTING PROFITS
Indefining bonafideprofits ,thesimpleformula,revenueminuscosts,repre-

services purchased, depreciation of equipment, and taxes. No matter how

meticulously the analyst carries out these computations, however, no calcu-
lation of profit can be satisfactory unless it passes a litmus test:
After a company earns a bona fide profit, its owners are wealthier
thantheywerebeforehand.
To underscore the point, there can be no bona fide profit without an
increase in wealth. Bona fide profits are the only kind of profits that truly
matter in financial analysis.
As for accounting profits, generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) define voluminous rules for calculating them with extraordinary
precision. For financial analysts, however, the practical definition of an
accountingprofit is simple:
Anaccountingprofitiswhatevertheaccountingrulessayitis.
If, during a stated interval, a business adds nothing to its owners’
wealth,buttheaccountingrulesstatethatithasearnedaprofit,thatisgood
enough. An accounting profit that reflects no genuine increase in wealth is
certainly sufficient for many stock market investors. They cheerfully assign
a price-earnings multiple to any number that a reputable accounting firm
waves its magic wand over and declares to be a profit.
What Is Revenue?
Suppose,forexample,thatanentrepreneurlaunchesarestaurant-franchising
business. The fictitious Salsa Meister International does not operate any
Salsa Meister restaurants. It merely sells franchises to other entrepreneurs
and collects franchise fees.
Thefranchisedrestaurants,sadtosay,consistentlylosemoney.Thatfact
has no bearing on Salsa Meister International’s accounting profit, however.
Therestaurants’operationsarenotpartofSalsaMeisterInternational,their
revenues are not its revenues, and their costs are not its costs. Salsa Meis-
ter International’s income consists entirely of franchise fees, which it earns
by rendering the franchisees such services as developing menus, providing
accounting systems, training restaurant employees, and creating advertising
campaigns.
An astute analyst will ask how money-losing franchisees come up with
cash to pay fees. The diagram in Exhibit 5.1 answers this riddle. Salsa Meis-
ter International sells stock to the public and then lends the proceeds to
the franchisees. The franchisees send the cash right back to Salsa Meister
International under the rubric of fees. Salsa Meister International gratefully

has not earned a bona fide profit either, regardless of what GAAP may say
about accounting profits.
Sooner or later, investors will come to this realization. When that hap-
pens, the company will lose its ability to manufacture accounting profits by
raising new funds in the stock market. Salsa Meister’s stock price will then
fall to itsintrinsicvalue—zero. Investors will suffer heavy losses, which they
could have avoided by asking whether the company’s reported profits truly
reflected increases in wealth. Moreover, the investors will continue making

WHICH COSTS COUNT?
Thewillingnesstotakeaccountingprofitsatsomethingotherthanfacevalue
is an essential element of genuinely useful financial statement analysis. It is
likewise imperative that analysts exercise care in deciding what to substi-
tute for a GAAP definition of profit. Once they leave the GAAP world of
agreed-upon rules, analysts enter a free market of ideas, where numerous
parties hawk competing versions of earnings.
Corporations have vastly increased their promulgation of non-GAAP
numbers in this century. By 2017, the independent research provider Audit
Analytics found that fully 97 percent of S&P 500 companies included some
self-produced measures in their earnings releases, up from a little over
half two decades earlier. Between 1996 and 2016 the average number of
non-GAAP items in those statements rose from just over two to more than
seven.
1
Analysts need to be discriminating in their use of these alternative
presentations of reality, but the same can be said of GAAP numbers.
Economist Andrew Smithers found that in the ten-year periods ending 1957
to 2002, the reported earnings of the companies constituting the S&P 500
were about as volatile as the top-down corporate earnings drawn from U.S.
national accounts. In subsequent years, Smithers found, the companies’
reported earnings were five times more volatile than the after-tax profits
reported in the national accounts.
2
Smithers deemed it highly unlikely that the national accounts data had
become unreliable. The other explanation for his findings was that account-
ing reforms of the 1990s rendered GAAP earnings much more volatile than
formerly. Shifting numerous items fromhistorical cost accounting to fair
valueaccounting was meant to promote more efficient allocation of capital.
The unintended effect was to make reported earnings more procyclical,
as asset prices incorporated estimates of future profits as well as currently

realizedearnings.Thiswasonereasonreportedearningsbecamelessclosely
correlated with movements in stock prices. Analysts who deployed their
skills within investment organizations had little choice but to pay greater
attention to companies’ non-GAAP figures, notwithstanding the underlying
calculations’ lack of standardization.
Many of the deviations from GAAP hang on the question of which
costs to eliminate from the calculations. While some of the popular income
statement variants offer insight into knotty problems of financial statement
analysis, others have the opposite effect of obscuring the facts. Many issuers
of financial statements attempt to exploit dissatisfaction with GAAP by
encouraging analysts to adopt earnings measures that make their own
profits appear higher than either their accounting profits or their bona
fide profits.
In 2020, some companies broke new ground by adding back costs
imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. German manufacturer Schenck Pro-
cess turned a 16 percent year-over-year earnings decline in that year’s first
quarter into an increase of nearly 20 percent by steering analysts toward
its EBITDAC, i.e., earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization,
and coronavirus.
3
Not surprisingly, corporations’ stepped-up use of non-GAAP has
attracted regulators’ attention. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s
Regulation G does not prohibit companies from presenting non-standard
numbers in their earnings releases. In those releases, however, companies
are required to explain why they are providing a non-GAAP metric and
quantitatively reconcile it with the most directly comparable GAAP metric.
Companies must also present the comparable GAAP metric at least as
prominently as the non-GAAP one.
The archetype for many alternative earnings measures is a version that
adds back depreciation. As far back as 1930, one investment expert urged
investors to ignore accounting-based earnings in the following words:

give effect to depreciation charges. But depreciation, after all, is a

forthe investor to obtain, ifpossible, earnings before depreciation,

Observe that the author does not dispute the relevance of depreciation
to the calculation of earnings. Rather, he objects that it is too malleable.5
The issuer of the statements can raise or lower its reported earnings simply

by using its latitude to assume shorter or longer average lives for its depre-
ciable assets.
It is fair to assume, in the case of financial statements that companies
present to potential investors, that “such net earnings as are desired” are
higherthanthecompany’sbonafideprofits.Therefore,thenecessaryadjust-
ment is toincrease depreciation and therebyreduce earnings. The author
agrees with today’s boosters of alternative earnings measures that proper
analysis requires adjustments to reported income, but he is very far from
urging analysts to ignore depreciation altogether.
Promoters of many companies with negligible reported earnings, on the
otherhand,arenotbashfulabouturginginvestorstodisregarddepreciation.
This audacious assault on the very foundations ofaccrual accountingdraws
itsinspirationfromtheworldofprivatelyowned real estate,where thelogic
of managing a public company is turned upside down. Instead of exploiting
every bit of latitude in the accounting rules to maximize reported earnings,
private owners of real estate strive to minimize reported income and, by
extension, income taxes. Accordingly, when a private investor acquires a
building (a depreciable), the investor typically attributes a large portion and
the land that it sits on (which is not depreciable), they typically attribute
as large a portion of the purchase price as possible to the building. That
treatment maximizes the depreciation expense and minimizes the owner’s
taxes.
Let us suppose that annual rental revenue on the building offsets the
landlord’s out-of-pocket expenses, such as maintenance, repairs, property
taxes, and interest on the property’s mortgage. The owner, in other words,
is breaking even, before taking into account the noncash expense of depre-
ciation. Including depreciation, the property shows an annual loss, which

the owner sells the land and building. After paying of the mortgage bal-

to the tendency of real estate values to rise over time.

chasing the building. According to our definition, the investor has realized
a bona fide profit, despite reporting losses every single year. Adding to the
paradox is the investor’s success in selling the property for a gain. Economic
theory states that an investment has value only because it produces prof-
its. By extension, the value can increase only if the profits increase. In this

red ink.
Naturally, these curious events have a rational explanation. The rate at
which the tax code allows owners to write off property overstates actual
wear and tear. Over the typically very long life of a building, it may get
depreciated several times over for tax purposes. The disparity between eco-
nomic depreciation and tax-based depreciation may be viewed as a subsidy
for socially productive investment. Alternatively, it can be seen as a testa-
ment to the real estate operators’ influence over the legislators who write
the tax code.
Either way, a conventional income statement provides a cockeyed view
of the profitability of buying and selling buildings. A closer approximation

of the investment and take out a bigger sum at the end, while also generat-

building.
How Far Can the Concept Be Stretched?
Toalimitedextent,aprofitabilityanalysisthatignoresdepreciationisappli-
cable outside the world of real estate. In the broadcasting business, compa-
nies typically record depreciation and amortization expense that far exceeds
physical wear and tear on assets. For example, when a company buys a
radio or television station, the price reflects a comparatively small compo-
nentofplantandequipment.Thelargerportionofthestation’svaluederives

Clearly, the deliberate neglect of depreciation is an analytical option
that should be used with discretion. In many industries, fixed assets con-
sist mainly of machines or vehicles that really do diminish in value through

use.Themajorriskofanalyticalerrordoesnotarisefromthepossibilitythat
reported depreciation expense will substantially exceed economic deprecia-
tion, but the reverse.
Through a false analogy with real estate and broadcasting, any
marginally unprofitable company in a capital-intensive business can declare
itself to be in the black. The trick is simply to proclaim that analysts should
no longer consider depreciation. Supposed earnings generated in such
fashion qualify as neither accounting profits nor bona fide profits, however.
CONCLUSION
Despite the critical importance of measuring profit, businesspeople can-
not produce a definition that is satisfactory in every situation. Even the
simple formula of revenue minus costs founders on the malleability of
accounting-based revenues and costs. As Chapters 6 and 7 demonstrate,
these basic measures of corporate performance are far too subject to
manipulation and distortion to be taken at face value. Also, our brief
discussions of real estate and leveraged buyouts show that net earnings can
be calculated in perfect accordance with GAAP yet bear little relation to an
investor’s rate of return.
Inlightofsuchobservations,financialanalystsmustwalkafineline.On
the one hand, they must not lose touch with economic reality by hewing to
accounting orthodoxy. On the other hand, they must not accept the version
of reality that seekers of cheap capital would like to foist on them. Analysts

CHAPTER 6
Revenue Recognition
E
xperience teaches that it can be dangerous to accept reported revenues
at face value, even if they have been audited. Many corporations employ
highly aggressive recognition practices that comply with GAAP yet distort
the underlying economic reality. Sometimes, executives hell-bent on making
their numbers will cross the line into fraudulent revenue recognition. Often,
outward signs of exceptional success indicate in reality a high probability of
downwardrevisionsofpreviouslyreportedrevenues.Underintensepressure
to maintain their stock prices, companies characterized by extremely rapid
sales growth seem particularly prone to taking liberties.
MAKING IT UP AT GOWEX
Gowex had a lot to celebrate in March 2014. Since its initial public offer-
ingfouryears earlier,theSpanish provider ofwi-fihotspotsandsupportser-
vices for mobile phone carriers had seen its stock rise by 2,700 percent. On
March20thecompany announced itspreliminaryconsolidatedsalesfigures
for 2013, which it described as “more than outstanding.”
1 At €182.8 mil-
lion, sales were up by 60 percent over 2012 and exceeded the company’s
own forecasts by 7.53 percent.
Lavish outside recognition had accompanied Gowex’s financial success.
In 2011 the company won the Internet Day prize for Best Company. Two
years later the first European Small & Mid-Cap Awards honored Gowex
as the Best New Listed Company. In 2014 the Spanish government added
its Start-Ex award to the company’s plaudits. On March 28 Gowex’s stock
reached an all-time high of €26.00, up from just €4.32 one year earlier. On
June25,2014,founderandChiefExecutiveOfficerJenaroGarciapredicted
thatGowexwouldsoonbeprovidingwi-fiserviceto20percentoftheearth’s

The following week, in an astounding reversal of fortune, Gowex’s
shares plunged by 60 percent in just two days, closing at €7.92 on July 2.

136 A CLOSER LOOK AT PROFITS
(The stock had already fallen by 23 percent from its March 28 peak.)
Gowex stock was suspended from trading on July 3.
On July 5 CEO Garcia resigned after admitting that he had falsified
Gowex’s financial statements by overstating revenues for at least the last
four years. A few days later he acknowledged that the fakery dated back
to at least 2005. The company announced that it would file for insolvency.
On July 16 Santander Private Banking Gestion reported that it had placed a
valueofzeroontheGowexsharesinthreeinvestmentfundsthatitmanaged.
Clues to the fraudulent accounting responsible for Gowex’s downfall
were detectable by astute financial analysts. In fact, it was a report
2
alleging a tenfold overstatement of revenues, published on July 1, 2014, by
Gotham City Research LLC, that precipitated the stock price collapse. The
short-selling firm’s analysis concluded that Gowex’s actual revenues were
no more than 10 percent of what the company reported.
In a classic response, Garcia initially denied the research report’s accu-
sations, calling it “categorically false”
3 and “defamatory.”4 He threatened
legal action against Gotham City. The company’s auditor made jokes about
the comic book character Batman, who lives in the fictitious Gotham City.
Beforelong,however,Garciaconcededthatthechargesweretrue.Court
testimony by Chief Financial Officer Francisco Martinez Marugan detailed
Garcia’s orders to employees to falsify financial data and engage in dou-
ble billing. Garcia admitted that Gowex had created fictitious customers,
in one instance by paying his maid €300 to sign papers creating a bogus
company.
Gowex’s share price began its slide before Gotham City’s bombshell
landed, even as Garcia conducted a cross-European roadshow with insti-
tutional investors. Analysts worried that the shares had gotten overvalued
and also expressed concerns about the company’s transparency. Two ana-
lysts said they had never managed to meet with or speak to the company’s
investor relations manager – CEO Garcia’s wife, Florencia Mate Garabito.
In eight months of intensive research, digging into publicly available
information and speaking to Gowex executives and the company’s com-
petitors, Gotham City uncovered additional reasons for skepticism. For
example, Gowex said it was receiving €7.5 million for a contract with New
York City, but then told Gotham that the payment was €2 million. The
New York Economic Development Corp. said the true figure was just
$245,000, equivalent to roughly €179,000 on July 1, 2014.
Gotham City found another discrepancy in statements made at vari-
ous times about Gowex’s revenue. In 2003 Garcia stated that the company
clearedalargeprofitonturnover(revenue)of€42.0millionin2002.Accord-
ingtoGowex’sIPOofferingcircularin2010,however,revenuestotaledonly
€2.7 million in 2003.

Revenue Recognition 137
Further doubts about the integrity of Gowex’s financial reporting arose
from the fact that its audit fee totaled only 0.04 percent to 0.06 percent
of revenues during 2011–2013. Gotham showed that over the same period,
five comparable companies’ fees collectively averaged 0.77 percent to 0.94
percentofrevenues.Gowex’sauditfee,byGothamCity’sreckoning,implied
a business 5 to 10 percent its supposed size.
Gowex’s auditor constituted another red flag. As Gotham pointed out,
it is very rare for a company with $1 billion to $2 billion of market value
to select an obscure auditor. Gowex’s appeared to be the only public com-
pany client of M&A Auditores, S.L., a name largely unknown even within
Spain. M&A’s office was a small room in an apartment complex. The audi-
tor’s business card did not contain a business email address, so he wrote his
personal Gmail address on the back of the card he provided to Gotham’s
research staff.
Gotham’s 93-page research report concluded that Gowex’s revenues
were 90 percent less than reported and that its true stock value was zero.
Its investigations found that 90 percent of the company’s Telecom revenue
originated from undisclosed, related parties. Gowex Telecom’s website had
not been updated in years, suggesting to Gotham that it was no longer in
business.
Troublingly, too, Gowex did not publicly disclose such basic metrics as
itshotspotcountorsegmentdetailsofitswirelessrevenue.Whenpressedby
Gotham, Garcia said Gowex’s hotspots numbered in the 100,000s. Another
analystsaidGarciaquotedhimafigureof200,000.ExaminationofGowex’s
hotspot map produced a count of only 5,530.
Just one example of Gotham’s methodology involved Gowex’s listing of
Telefonica among its largest customers. Gotham confirmed that there was
a contract between the two companies but established that no payments
were going from Telefonica to Gowex. Gowex was making payments to
Telefonica for purposes that Gotham could not determine.
Gotham’s deep dive into the underlying facts clearly established that
Gowex’s reported numbers were not credible. On a completely different
track, Messod Daniel Beneish of the Kelley School of Business at Indiana
University analyzed the company’s reported numbers with a model he
devised to ferret out evidence of earnings manipulation. Shortly before
the revelations of fraudulent reporting devastated the company’s market
value, Beneish’s model indicated a 71.3 percent probability that Gowex
was manipulating its financials. That meant, by Beneish’s reckoning, that
Gowex was 103.3 times as likely to be a fraud than the average firm in the
market.
Beneish’s model is described in a 1999 Financial Analysts Journal
article.

are shown below. “High” levels for variables 3, 4, and 7 are in comparison
to averages of industry peer companies.
1. Days’ sales in receivables index. Definition: Current year’s ratioofdays’
salesinreceivablesdividedbypreviousyear’s.Ifdays’salesinreceivables
increases sharply, it may indicate that the company is booking fictitious
sales on which cash is not being collected.
2. Gross margin index.Definition:Previousyear’sgrossmargindividedby
current year’s gross margin. If this ratio exceeds 1x, gross margin has
deteriorated. That is a sign that a company’s prospects are worsening,
potentially tempting management to manipulate its earnings.
3. Asset quality index. Definition: Current year’s ratio of noncurrent
assets other than property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) to total assets,
divided by previous year’s ratio. The future benefits of non-PP&E assets
are potentially less certain than those of PP&E assets. A rise in the
asset quality index is a hint that the company may be increasingly defer-
ring, rather than expensing, costs, which would imply an overstatement
of current earnings.
4. Sales growth index. Definition: Ratio of current year’s sales to previous
year’s sales. High sales growth does not automatically imply manipula-
tion. High-growth companies, however, often experience intense pres-
sure to achieve earnings targets. Knowing that the first indication of a
slowdown will deal a severe blow to itsstock price, such a company has
a greater incentive to manipulate earnings than one for which investors
expect only sales growth in line with nominal (inflation-included) Gross
Domestic Product.
5. Sales, general, and administrative expenses index. Definition: Current
year’s ratio of sales, general, and administrative expenses to sales,
divided by previous year’s ratio. A high level of this index suggests poor
prospects for the company, hence a strong incentive for manipulation.
6. Leverage index. Definition: Current year’s ratio of total debt to total
assets, divided by previous year’s ratio. If this index is greater than
one, indicating rising leverage, the company may have an incentive to
manipulate its earnings in order to avoid triggering a default on its debt
covenants.
7. Total accruals to total assets. Definition: Change in working capital
accountsotherthancashlessdepreciation,dividedbytotalassets.Ifthis

GLOBO’S FORESEEN FALL FROM GRACE
Globo, an Athens-based producer of mobile-device software, suffered a
seemingly sudden reversal of fortune in 2015. From its 2014 year-end price
of£40.00thecompany’sstocksoaredto£62.25onJune10.Ninedayslater,
Standard & Poor’s assigned the proposed $180 million senior secured note
offeringbyGlobo’sU.S.subsidiaryaBB–rating,acomparativelyhighgrade
within the speculative category. The rapidly expanding company planned
to use the proceeds of the debt sale primarily to fund acquisitions. On
August 18, the International Data Corporation’s 2014 report on Worldwide
Enterprise Mobility Management noted that Globo’s latest year-over-year
116.9 percent revenue increase measured more than four times the industry
growth rate. A little more than two months later, however, the company
requested a suspension of trading in its shares. By then the stock price was
less than half the June 10 peak, at £28.25. On October 26, Standard &
Poor’s downgraded the company from BB– to CCC and withdrew its rating
on Globo’s still uncompleted bond offering.
The event that triggered Globo’s swift fall from grace was the
October 22, 2015, publication of a research report, authored by hedge
fund firm Quintessential Capital Management, labeling the company a
fraud. Predictably, Globo initially denied all of the report’s allegations. On

140 A CLOSER LOOK AT PROFITS
To observers not previously familiar with Globo, its demise appeared
to be an overnight event. Long before October 2015, however, there were
numerous clues that something was amiss. To begin, with, in 2014’s first
quarter Globo fired its auditor. In a letter to shareholders dated March 6,
2014, CEO Papadimitrakopoulos stated that the board had decided to
replace BDO with Grant Thornton because BDO’s proposed cost of its
audit was not competitive. In a statement under Section 519 of the U.K.’s
Companies Act of 2006, however, BDO said that it was asked to resign
because of an inability to agree on the scope of the audit. BDO specified
that under Globo’s terms it would not have sufficient involvement in the
work of component auditors, without which it could not obtain sufficient
information on which to base its opinion.
Even prior to the appearance of that classic red flag, however, Ennis-
more Fund Management detected several trouble signs in Globo’s finan-
cial statements. To begin with, Globo’s 2013 Interim Results announcement
reportedthat€10millionofit€30milliontotalrevenuesfortheperiodcame
from its GO!Enterprise product, an app by which a company’s employees
can obtain remote access to work servers from their own personal mobile
devices.(ThisproductcategorygoesbytheacronymBYOD,for“bringyour
own device.”) Of the €10 million of GO!Enterprise revenues, said Globo,
57 percent came from license sales. Globo declined Ennismore’s request to
name any GO!Enterprise customers. The London-based investment man-
agement firm attempted to contact most of the corporate customers named
in Globo results and presentations. None of them confirmed that they were
GO!Enterprise BYOD product licensees and some stated that they were not,
although some apparently used other Globo products or services.
Globo reported in its 2012 final results that GO!Enterprise had a total
of 250,000 active licensees through two license schemes. Revenue growth
reported for the first half of 2013 implied a significant increase in active
licensees during that period. The company’s investor relations department
confirmedtoEnnismorethatendusersaccessed theGO!Enterprisesoftware
via download from Apple’s AppStore or Android Market, with two-thirds
of users utilizing Google’s Android operating system.
According to Ennismore, the company mentioned no other download
method in its September 2012 discussions. Yet as of August 29, 2013, the
GO!Enterprise app had been downloaded from Google Play, the largest app
store by far for Android users, only 1,000 to 5,000 times. By Ennismore’s
calculation, that amounted to less than 5 percent of the end users implied
by the product’s reported revenue. By contrast, Good Technology’s compa-
rable BYOD product had been downloaded 500,000 to 1,000,000 times on
Google Play, supporting the notion that downloading from app stores is the
industry-standard distribution method.

Ennismore also noted that Globo had not generated positive free cash
flowinanyyearsince2004,thefirstyearforwhichfinancialstatementswere
available. The firm’s report further stated that “from the growth in receiv-
ables, it appears that little revenue has been collected over the past year.”
Precisely pinning down the increase in trade receivables was not feasible
because the figure reported by Globo did not adjust for the disposal of 51
percent of the company’s Greek subsidiary near the end of 2012. Ennismore
calculated, however, that if the subsidiary’s year-end 2012 trade receivables
approximated those of June 30, 2012, then trade receivables for continuing
operationsrosebyabout150percentin2012,anamountroughlyequivalent
to all of the year’s reported GO!Enterprise revenue.
Internally, Ennismore conducted further analysis that compared Globo
with mobile products industry peers on a variety of financial ratios. The
companies displayed in Exhibit 6.1 include both the industry leader, Good
Technology Corporation, and the field’s one other listed company, Mobile-
Iron,Inc.Theotherthreeshowninthetablearelargecompanieswithmobile

142 A CLOSER LOOK AT PROFITS
Strong margins in a business in which direct competitors were losing money
justified skepticism about the validity of the profits Globo was reporting.
Further evidence that Globo’s sales were inflated appeared in the form
of its 164 days sales outstanding (DSO) of trade receivables. That was
almost double the level reported by industry leader Good Technology.
Bloated receivables balances are a classic red flag, indicating that sales
are not turning into cash receipts – possibly because they are fictitious.
Furthermore, software companies do not ordinarily generate large receiv-
ables. They typically sell their products through licenses, with cash paid in
advance, or by subscription.
Globo’s way-outside-the-mainstream accrued income as a percentage
of revenues raised similar concerns. This item refers to revenue that the
company has already recognized but for which customers have not yet been
billed. Even more troubling, Globo showed only a negligible 4 percent of
unearned income as a percentage of revenue. That contrasted radically with
Good Technology’s 201 percent and MobileIron’s 43 percent. Unearned
income is generally a large item for software companies, which have an
obligation to provide services for which they have already been paid.
As a result of its high DSO and low unearned income, Globo required
substantial outside funding of its working capital. Its peers, on the other
hand,generated sizablefundsfromworkingcapital,asindicatedinthetable
by negative working capital funding as a percentage of revenue.
To seasoned analysts, Globo’s sharp divergences from industry norms
on all of these ratios raised questions about the validity of its balance sheet.
Globo drew down roughly €25 million of a revolving credit facility in the
first half of 2015, even though it reported that it ended 2014 with €82 mil-
lion in cash and €40 million in net (of debt) cash. Ennismore noted that
revolvers are there to be drawn when needed. Why would the company
incur significant interest costs when it supposedly had as much cash as it
required sitting in the bank? That troubling question helps to explain why
the 2015 Quintessential Capital Management report that precipitated the
company’s collapse was titled, “Our Final Opinion: It’s a Greek Parmalat.”
(See Chapter 11. A major red flag prior to that company’s bankruptcy was
its heavy borrowing despite claiming to have a huge cash balance.)
Based on its findings, Ennismore sold Globo’s shares short, as disclosed
in its January 22, 2014, report. Short-selling, to be sure, is not part of every
investor’s repertoire. Applying the techniques detailed in Ennismore’s report
can, however, benefit long-only market players. They may avoid future col-
lapses of stocks that skyrocketed with the help of misleading or even fraud-
ulent financial reporting.

CHANNEL-STUFFING IN THE DRUG BUSINESS
On April 3, 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb shares plummeted by as much as
14 percent in after-hours trading after the company said first-quarter earn-
ingsfromoperations wouldbe$0.44to$0.47ashare.Analystssurveyed by
Thomson Financial/First Call had been expecting $0.56. For the full year,
saidthepharmaceuticalproducer,earningswoulddropbyatleast25percent

Inthewakeofthenegativesurprise,ChiefExecutiveOfficerPeterDolan
assumed direct responsibility for the worldwide medicines business. The
previous head of the unit left the company. Two weeks later, the company
announced that its chief financial officer would step down as well.
The explanation for the sudden drop in projected earnings was that in
2001 Bristol-Myers gave wholesalers discounts to induce them to buy its
products at a much faster rate than necessary to fill prescriptions at phar-
macies. That boosted revenues for certain drugs in 2001, as sales to whole-
salers ran above end demand by consumers. In 2002, however, instead of
reordering, wholesalers worked down their bloated inventories to supply
theirpharmacycustomers.Bristol-Myers’ssalestowholesalersconsequently
slackened. Dolan told analysts and investors that the company was cutting
back shipments and that 2002 profits would depend on how quickly the
wholesalers’ inventory levels could be reduced.
Channel-stuffing is a security analysts’ term for the financial reporting
gimmick that Bristol-Myers employed to accelerate future revenues to the
current period. Drug wholesalers were happy to hold more inventory than
they needed, as long as the discounts they received were large enough to
cover the relatedcarrying costs. Expiration dates for the drugs they took
into inventory were typically about two years in the future, so there was
little risk that the products would lose their value while sitting in the whole-
salers’ warehouses. Furthermore, wholesalers that bought extra drugs at the
current price stood to gain from subsequent increases in the retail price by
themanufacturer.Thepricehikeswouldallowthemtotakehighermarkups
on inventory purchased at the old price.
Why, though, would Bristol-Myers bother to stuff its wholesale distri-
bution channels, especially considering that the discounts represented sales
dollarsforgoneandnevertoberecovered?Wholesalerscouldabsorbonlyso
much redundant inventory. Sooner or later, the scheme would have to end,
making it apparent that the company had overstated earnings by borrowing
sales from future periods.
That is exactly what happened to Bristol-Myers. On March 10, 2003,
the company restated its financial statements for 1999 through 2001 to

correct “errors and inappropriate accounting.” The company chopped
earnings from continuing operations by about $900 million, partially offset
by an upward revision for 2002. Earlier, the company had told investors
that its planned restatement would merely shift reported revenues from
earlier periods to 2002 and 2003. As it turned out, however, the company
deleted $2.5 billion from the earlier years and booked only $1.9 billion
in the later years, explaining that the disappearance of $0.6 billion was
“primarily due to changes in accruals from sales returns, rebates,”
6 and
accounting changes. Bristol-Myers stock, which had reached a peak of
$70.37 at the end of 2000, closed at $22.51. Even after this damage to
investors, Bristol-Myers was not done with its revisions. On March 16,
2004, the company restated its 1999 through 2002 earnings and its 2003
earnings upward.
Background of a Doomed Scheme
Thestock’sprecipitousdeclineduring2001and2002helpedtoexplainwhy
Bristol-Myers manipulated its earnings in a manner that was sure to prove
unsustainable. Along with other pharmaceutical producers, Bristol-Myers
was feeling profit pressures due to difficulties in developing new drugs to
replace sales of products on which patent protection was expiring. The
company had not generated a single major drug from billions of research
dollars since the 1989 merger of Bristol-Myers and Squibb. Management’s
biggest hope, the hypertension drug Vanlev, failed to obtain Food and Drug
Administration approval in 2000 after adverse side effects were discovered.
In 2001, the company suffered embarrassment when it agreed to pay
$2 billion for cancer drug Erbitux, a discovery of biotechnology company
ImClone Systems that later failed to obtain Food and Drug Administration
approval.
In 1996, then-CEO Charles Heimbold Jr. promised investors 12 percent
annualearningsgrowththrough2000.Thattargetprovedelusiveasindustry
competition escalated and a low-priced generic alternative threatened sales
of a top-selling Bristol-Myers cancer drug. Following a late 1999 meeting,
Heimbold replaced Donald Haydon Jr., the head of the medicines group.
According to past and present company executives interviewed by theWall
Street Journal,
7 Haydon was known for speaking candidly about Bristol-
Myers’sdeclining salesprospects. Consequently, hisreassignment was taken
as a message that executives must meet their sales quotas at all costs. At
that point, the medicines group began offering wholesalers discounts to
induce them to order at higher levels than expected pharmacy prescriptions
justified.

In addition, according to the interviewed executives, Bristol-Myers
started to pump up the bottom line by taking into earnings portions of
restructuring reserves created in earlier periods. This was contrary to
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accounting policy, reiterated
in a 1999 bulletin, requiring that such reserves be used exclusively for
specified purposes and prohibiting them from being taken into earnings
in small amounts over time. Also suspect was Bristol-Myers’s repeated
practice of establishing restructuring reserves that exactly equaled gains
on asset sales. In addition, the executives said, the company frequently
added a penny or two to earnings per share (EPS) through gains on sales of
small product lines, without reporting the divestments or highlighting them
as one-time events. The SEC frowned on withholding information about
such transactions on claims of immateriality and stated that even if one
small transaction could be legitimately ignored, failing to disclose a number
of them could be materially misleading. Finally, some of the interviewed
executives contended that in mid-2001, Bristol-Myers overstated the
portion of its $7.8 billion acquisition of DuPont’s drug business that was
attributable to in-process research and development and therefore qualified
for immediate write-off under GAAP. The SEC had long claimed that
companies were overvaluing in-process R&D to minimize the amount of
goodwill that might cause a subsequent write-down. Executives interviewed
by the Wall Street Journal contended that the company overstated the
in-process R&D write-off to create the possibility of reversing portions of
it in the future, as yet one more way to tweak reported earnings.
Company officials strenuously denied that its accounting policies were
gearedtowardmanagingearningsor,byextension,maximizingthecompen-
sationofseniorexecutiveswhosecompensationwaslinkedtothecompany’s
stock price. Bristol-Myers’s March 10, 2003, write-down, however, came in
thecontextofacceleratingSECandFederalBureauofInvestigationinquiries
into senior management’s role in the improper accounting.
In August 2004, Bristol-Myers agreed to pay $150 million to settle
SEC charges of accounting fraud. This was followed in June 2005 by a
$300 million settlement of Justice Department charges that also arose from
inventory manipulation. The company further agreed that CEO Dolan
would surrender the title of chairman and pledged to endow a chair in
businessethicsatSetonHallUniversityLawSchool. ChristopherJ.Christie,
theU.S.attorneyinNewarkwhowassubsequentlyelectedgovernorofNew
Jersey, said the scheme reflected a corporate culture that emphasized higher
sales at all costs. “These people had knowledge which they should have
disclosed to the investing public, which they did not,” Christie commented.
“It’s not a channel-stuffing case. It’s a failure-to-disclose case.”

Detecting Excessive Inventory
Not everyone was caught entirely off guard by Bristol-Myers’s revelation of
clogged-updistributionchannels.Severaldaysbeforethecompany’sApril3,
2002, announcement, Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Tighe wrote that the
inventory in the wholesale distribution chain for the company’s top 10 core
retailbrandscouldtotal$500millionto$800million.
9 Thatwouldapprox-
imate 2.42 times average weekly sales, an abnormally high level. Tighe esti-
mated that the resulting sales deceleration would penalize Bristol-Myers
earnings per share by $0.02 to $0.03 in 2002’s first quarter.
The analyst derived his estimate of wholesale inventories for Bristol
Myers’s10majordrugs,representing50percentofpharmaceuticalrevenues,
from price and prescription statistics of IMS Health, a vendor of health care
data. For example, IMS reported that pharmacy-level sales of Pravachol, a
cholesterol-reducing drug, grew by 8 percent in 2001 and the retail price
increased by 6 percent. Bristol-Myers reported a 21 percent sales gain for
the year, implying a gap of 7 percent versus the sell-through at pharma-
cies.10 The largest such sales disparity, amounting to $1.7 billion, involved
Glucophage, an oral antidiabetic. According to IMS, prescriptions declined
by 8 percent, offsetting an 8 percent retail price increase, yet Bristol-Myers
recorded an 18 percent sales gain. Tighe reckoned that Glucophage whole-
sale inventories equaled a staggering 78 percent of his estimated 2002 sales
for the brand.
It turned out that the inventory bloat and resulting earnings impact
were even greater than Tighe’s analysis suggested. Still, the detection of
channel-stuffing was an alarm bell for the impending stock price decline.
More impressively still, UBS Warburg analyst C. J. Sylvester warned of
excess inventory on the order of $550 million in September 2001, half a
year before the company dropped its bombshell.
Unfortunately for most users of financial statements, annual subscrip-
tions to the data required for this sort of analysis, provided by companies
such as IMS and NDCHealth, run into tens of thousands of dollars. The
Bristol-Myers Squibb case study nevertheless illustrates the value of testing
a company’s reported earnings against independently provided information.
Publicly available statistics for sales in certain industries, such as automo-
biles and casinos, can provide a helpful check.

have that ability.

These are not the words of a career criminal, but of one of the many
devotees ofGrand Theft Auto 3,a video game produced byTake-Two Inter-
active Software. Another way that players score in the hugely popular game
is to have sex with a prostitute, then murder her and steal her money. Other
popular strategies consist of shooting random pedestrians and bludgeoning
them with a baseball bat. Such features have earnedGrand Theft Auto 3the
distinction of being banned in Australia.
Less brutal, but nonimaginary, misdeeds won Take-Two a place in the
annals of financial misrepresentation. The story began to unfold after the
company’s share price more than doubled in less than six months. Even
at that, some experts considered the stock undervalued relative to industry
peers such as Electronic Arts and Activision, giving rise to speculation that
Take-Two might be an attractive candidate for acquisition by Microsoft.
Near-term dreams of continued upward momentum in the stock were
shattered on December 14, 2001. Take-Two plunged by $4.72 to $10.33,
a 31 percent drop, on rumors that the company might have to restate its
earnings.Therumorsprovedonthemark.Take-TwoannouncedonDecem-
ber17thatitwouldrestateitsearningsforthefirstthreequartersofthefiscal
year ending October 31, 2001. According to management, the adjustment
arose because the company recorded revenue on some games it sold to “cer-
tain independent third-party distributors,” but which were later returned
to or repurchased by Take-Two. The company estimated that earnings per
share for fiscal 2000 would be restated from $0.88 to $0.75–$0.77.
Surprisingly to some observers, Take-Two’s stock rose by $3.23 to
$13.56, a 31 percent gain, on December 17. To short seller Marc Cohodes
of Rocker Partners, the company’s announcement was evidence that it was
relying on accounting gimmickry. As he characterized it, Take-Two had
been selling products to itself and including those sales in its revenues.
12
President Paul Eibeler, however, complained that the restatements were
overshadowingTake-Two’s“underlyingstrength” 13 andthatthecompany’s
prospects for fiscal 2002 were strong. Some Wall Street analysts shared
that view. Wedbush Morgan Securities’s Miguel Iribarren reiterated his buy
recommendation with a one-year price target of $25. Commerce Capital
Markets’ Richard Zimmerman confirmed his strong buy with a target
of $20.
For the next few months, the financial reporting news got worse. On
January 22, 2002, Take-Two announced that it would postpone the release
of its fourth quarter and fiscal year-end results. The Nasdaq stock market
promptlyhaltedtradinginTake-Two’sshares.OnFebruary12,thecompany
restated its fiscal year 2001 earnings per share from $0.88 to $0.23, while
also slightly reducing its reported per-share loss for the first nine months of
fiscal 2002 from ($0.11) to ($0.09). In addition, Take-Two disclosed that
the SEC had launched an investigation of its accounting. The following day,

another classic red flag appeared, as the company’s chief financial officer,
Albert Pastino, resigned.
Despite these adverse developments, when trading in Take-Two shares
resumed on February 15, some analysts remained upbeat. Morgan Keegan’s
Bob DeLean commented, “On the negative side, management has no cred-
ibility and you have historically aggressive accounting. But going forward,
theyarehavingsuccesswithacoupleofbighitsandthebalancesheetisgoing
to look a lot better.”14 He rated the stock outperform, with a six-month tar-
get of $30–$35. Rocker Partners’ Cohodes remained the skeptic, arguing,
“The numbers have been made up, that we know for sure. Everything else
is speculation.”15
In this instance, contrary to the lesson taught by many other cases of
financial misreporting, it paid to accept the discredited management’s assur-
ances that the company’s business prospects looked bright. Analyst Iribar-
ren’s target of $20 by December 2002 was achieved in April of that year,
with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index nearly unchanged over the period.
The lower end of DeLean’s six-month target of $30–$35 by August 2002
was likewise reached, albeit tardily, in November 2002, notwithstanding a
15 percent drop in the S&P.
All this good news for shareholders came despite the fact that the rev-
enue recognition misreporting ultimately turned out to be more extensive
than the company disclosed in 2002. On January 31, 2004, Take-Two
announced it would restate earnings back as far as fiscal 1999. The latest
discrepancies involved the recording of reserves for price concessions.
On June 9, 2005, Take-Two agreed to a penalty of $7.5 million to settle
SEC charges of accounting fraud. Former Chairman Ryan Brant consented
to a penalty of $500,000 and disgorgement and prejudgment interest of
$3.1million,representingbonusesbasedontheoriginallyreportedearnings.

MAKING THE NUMBERS AT M/A-COM
On February 2, 2015, M/A-Com Technology Solutions Holdings reported
sales of $114.9 million, meeting (just barely) Wall Street analysts’ expec-
tations of around $114 million. Investors noticed, however, that the semi-
conductor producer cleared the hurdle only with the help of a well-timed
accounting change. Instead of holding firm in acknowledgement that expec-
tations had been met, M/A-Com’s share price dropped by 0.6 percent on a
day when the Russell 3000 Technology Index rose by 0.9 percent.
Theaccounting change, disclosedinconjunction withM/A-Com’searn-
ings release, involved sales to distributors, which represented nearly 25 per-
cent of total sales in the previous year. Formerly, the company recognized
revenuewhenthedistributorssoldM/A-Com’sproductstoendusers.Under
the newly instituted procedure, M/A-Com recognized revenue upon selling
to distributors and established a reserve against future returns.

Analyst Sam McBride of independent research firm New Constructs
pointed out that the newly adopted “sell-in” method raised the possibility
that channel-stuffing was occurring. That is, under pressure to meet quar-
terly sales targets, M/A-Com might have overloaded its distributors with
more inventory than they could possibly sell. The company would make its
numbers for the quarter, but might subsequently experience large returns,
resulting in a reversal of previously booked revenue. Earnings could take a
further hit from distributors requiring larger pricing adjustments or refunds
than M/A-Com had reserved for, giving investors an unpleasant surprise.
Worryingly, M/A-Com’sdays sales outstanding(DSO) increased to 65
days in the fiscal second quarter ending April 3, 2015, from 57 days one
year earlier. This kind of rise, coinciding with a shift to “sell-in,” could be a
signofchannel-stuffing,whichisotherwisedifficulttodetect.Companiesare
not required to disclose the amount of their products sitting in distributor
inventories.
Journalist Vito Racanelli detailed this financial reporting concern in
Barron’s in June 2015. He also questioned M/A-Com’s calculation of
non-GAAP earnings per share, which the company asserted was a better
reflection of its operations than the GAAP figures. Racanelli noted that the

non-GAAP results excluded various expenses that seemed recurring for a
tech company relying partly on acquisitions for its growth. Specifically,
he cited share-based compensation, some cash compensation, merger and
acquisition costs, and earn-out costs. The Barron’s columnist also drew
attention to the ongoing dilution of existing shareholders, pointing out that
shares outstanding had more than quadrupled over the proceeding four
years. Racanelli concluded, “The shares could be vulnerable to a selloff if
revenue disappoints.”18

ance for the fourth quarter of $0.45–$0.50, well below the bottom range of

19 percent below consensus forecasts. M/A-Com’s stock plunged by 20 per-
cent at the opening on August 2, 2017, while the Russell 3000 Technology
Index was down by less than 0.2 percent.
By the end of the day, M/A-Com shares had fallen by 25 percent. The
company blamed weakness in China for its disappointing results. Accord-
ing to Cowen analyst Paul Silverstein, recent channel checks indicated that
M/A-Com’s inventory buildup in China exceeded previous market expecta-
tions.ThisfindingdidnotnecessarilyprovethatM/A-Comhadbeenstuffing
the channels, but it was consistent with that explanation.
Reviewing these events a few years later, analyst McBride (then no
longer at New Constructs) cast some doubt on M/A-Com’s explanation
of its third-quarter disappointment. He cited a press release by Oclaro, a
key M/A-Com customer, concerning its own third-quarter 2017 results.
The manufacturer of optical components said that softness in its Chinese
revenues was in line with expectations. This implies that the slowdown
in demand that M/A-Com blamed for its surprisingly low fourth-quarter
guidance should have been baked into its revenue outlook well before the
beginning of August.
McBride identified one other possible indication that M/A-Com’s num-
bers leading up to the third-quarter 2017 bombshell were not completely

Revenue Recognition 151
On April 11, 2019, M/A-Com dropped by 11 percent versus a 0.2
percent gain for the tech index. That day the company announced the
resignation of its chief financial officer. M/A-Com’s management deemed it
necessary to specify that the CFO’s sudden departure was unrelated to any
matters involving its financial statements or accounting practices.
Many factors other than the quality of a company’s financial reporting
influence its share price. M/A-Com’s stock might have declined as much as
it did between 2017 and 2019 even if the company had been lauded for
its accounting practices instead of having its revenue recognition practices
questioned by skeptical analysts. Even so, investors’ experience with numer-
ous companies over many years teaches that it is worth paying attention to
issues like those raised by McBride and Racanelli in 2015.
ASTRAY ON LAYAWAY
On August 9, 2000, Wal-Mart Stores (as Walmart Inc. was then known)
reported a 28 percent year-over-year increase in net income for its fiscal
second quarter ending July 31. At $0.36, earnings per share (diluted) were
up by 29 percent. Sales rose by a healthy 20 percent, climbing 5 percent at
Wal-Mart units open for more than one year.
Inlightoftheseresults,whichoneanalystcharacterizedas“averygood
quarter,” the discount chain’s share price might have been expected to rise.
At the very least, investors would have expected the stock to hold steady,
given that the EPS increase was in line with Wall Street analysts’ consen-
sus forecast, as reported by First Call/Thomson Financial. As it turned out,
however, Wal-Mart’s shares fell by $4.375 to $53.125. That represented an
8 percent decline on a day on which the Dow Jones Industrial Average
changed only modestly (down 0.6 percent).
Both the Wall Street Journal
19 and the Bloomberg newswire20 linked
the paradoxical drop in Wal-Mart’s stock to an accounting change that was
expected to reduce the following (third) quarter’s earnings. The retailer’s
management advised analysts to lower their earnings per share estimates
for the August-to-October period by 1.5 to 2 cents, to reflect a shift in the
company’s method of accounting for layaway sales. In such transactions,
customers reserve goods with down payments, then make additional pay-
ments over a specified period, receiving their merchandise when they have
paid in full. Prior to the change in accounting practice, which Financial
Accounting Standard (FAS) 101 made mandatory, Wal-Mart booked lay-
away sales as soon as it placed the merchandise on layaway. Under the new
and more conservative method, the company began to recognize the sales

only when customers completed the required payments and took possession
of the goods.
According to one analyst, Wal-Mart’s 8 percent stock price decline rep-
resented “somewhat of an overreaction.” In reality, the price drop was an
overreaction in its entirety. Changing the accounting method altered nei-
ther the amount of cash ultimately received by the retailer nor the timing of
its receipt. The planned change in Wal-Mart’s revenue recognition process
therefore entailed no loss in time value of money. Lest anyone mistakenly
continue to attribute economic significance to the timing of the revenue
recognition, Wal-Mart explained that the small reduction in reported earn-
ings in the third fiscal quarter would be made up in the fourth. On top of
everything else, management had already announced the accounting change
prior to its August 9 conference call.
An institutional portfolio manager spoke truly when he called the mar-
ket’s reaction to the supposed news “more confusion than anything else.” If
taken at face value, the press reports indicate that investors bid the shares
down on so-called news that was both dated and irrelevant. Alternatively,
investors may have had other reasons for driving down the shares. For one
thing, store traffic declined in the three months ended July 31 from the
preceding quarter’s level. Additionally, German operations posted a larger
loss than management had forecast. If these events were the true causes of
Wal-Mart’s slide, then theWall Street Journaland theBloomberg newswire
erred in attributing the sell-off to an accounting change with no real eco-
nomic impact. Either way, confusion reigned; the only question is whether
it was the investors or the journalists who were confused.
RECOGNIZING MEMBERSHIP FEES
Bally Total Fitness provided another case in which questions about revenue
recognition contributed to an unfavorable stock market reaction to seem-
inglyupbeatearningsnews.OnJuly30,1998,thehealthclubchainreported
diluted earnings per share of $0.08, up from a year-earlier loss of $0.59.

fluctuated in a range of 3 percent to 5 percent.

Revenue Recognition 153
InvestorswereunwillingtoacceptBally’searningsincreaseatfacevalue
because of the company’s growing reliance on memberships that it financed,
asopposedtosellingforcash.Bally’sfinancedcustomers’initialmembership
fees, which ranged from $600 to $1,400, for up to 36 months, charging
annual interest rates of 16 percent to 18 percent.22 (Ongoing dues repre-
sented just 27.9 percent of net revenues, with approximately 90 percent of
members paying an average of only about $7 a month in 1998.) On the
whole, the company’s reported profit margins benefited from the increase in
financed memberships as a percentage of total revenues. The reported earn-
ings, however, rested on assumptions regarding the percentage of customers
who would ultimately fail to make all of the scheduled installments.
Even under the best of circumstances, a considerable portion of any
health club’s new members let their memberships lapse, despite paying an
initial fee. As New York University accounting professor Paul Brown notes,
“People have little to lose from walking away from a health-club member-
ship.It’snotahealth-careplanwe’retalkingabout,orevenacar,whichthey
might need for transportation.”
23
To be sure, Bally set aside reserves for uncollectible amounts, consistent
with good accounting practice. The size of the reserves, however, required
judgment about the credit quality of the new members. Because financed
memberships were not entirely new to Bally, management had some
experience on which to base its assumptions. In addition, the company had
succeeded in increasing the use of an electronic funds transfer payment
option in recent years. Collection rates were higher for members whose
credit cards or bank accounts were automatically charged for fees than
for those billed through monthly statements. There were risks, though, in
stepping up reliance on customers who needed to borrow in order to join.
As in any sales situation, aggressive pursuit of new business could result in
acceptance of more marginally qualified customers. On average, the newer
members might prove to be less financially capable or less committed to
physical fitness than the previous purchasers of financed memberships. If
more members failed on their payments than management assumed, Bally
would prove inhindsight to have been too aggressive inrecognizing revenue
and would have to rescind previously reported income.
By taking the second-quarter 1998 earnings with a grain of salt, users
of financial statements were not necessarily casting aspersions on Bally’s
management.Rather,theywereunderstandablyapplyingcautioninevaluat-

sion staff’s behest in July 1997. Previously, Bally had fully recognized initial

membership fees at the time that the memberships were sold. A health club
operator could abuse this approach by using high-pressure tactics to book
financed memberships for individuals who were highly unlikely to keep up
theirpayments.Outsidersrelyingonthefinancialstatementswouldperceive
agrowthinrevenuesthatmust,intime,proveunsustainable.Underthenew
accounting treatment, Bally spread the revenues from the initial fees over
the expected membership lives – 36 months for sales made for cash on the
barrelhead and 22 months for financed sales.
The SEC’s urging of Bally to spread out its recognition of membership
fees was part of a broader effort extending beyond the health club industry.
There was no change in the accounting principle, namely, the matching con-
cept. In the case of a health club, members’ upfront fees represent payments
for services received over the term of their membership. Club operators
should therefore recognize the revenue over the period in which they ren-
der the service. During the late 1990s, the underlying theory underwent no
change, but the SEC intensified its focus on membership fees after determin-
ing that some companies were interpreting the rules too liberally. Among
the industries that came under increased scrutiny were the membership club
retailers. In this type of operation, consumers pay upfront fees for the priv-
ilege of shopping at stores that sell discounted merchandise.
On October 19, 1998, BJ’s Wholesale Club switched from immediate
recognition of its annual membership fee (typically $35 for two family
members) to incremental recognition of the fee over the full membership
term, generally 12 months. In conjunction with the change in accounting
policy, BJ’s restated its net income for the fiscal first half ending August 1
to $10.4 million. That was down 64 percent from the previously reported
$28.6 million. The restatement reflected a one-time charge for the account-
ing change’s cumulative effect on preceding years, as well as a $1.1 million
after-tax charge arising from a change to more conservative accounting for
new-store preopening expenses.
Just a month and a half before these events, BJ’s had issued a press
release asserting that its practice of immediately recognizing annual mem-
bership fees was consistent with GAAP.
24 Management had also argued
that no deferral was required, on the grounds that BJ’s offered its members
the right to cancel and receive refunds for only 90 days after enrollment.
A mere 0.5 percent of members actually requested refunds. In contrast to
the situation at Bally Total Fitness, moreover, membership fees represented
a minor portion of BJ’s revenues, 98 percent of which derived from mer-
chandise sales.
Under GAAP, however, the general requirement was to spread member-
ship fees over the full membership period. If a company offered refunds,
it could not bookany of the revenue until the refund period expired, unless

have entitled the company to begin booking the fees on the date that mem-
bersenrolled.Spreadingtherevenuerecognitionoverthemembershipperiod
would have been mandatory in any case.
25
In December 1999, the SEC staff clarified the point by issuing “Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 – Revenue Recognition in Financial State-
ments” (SAB 101). The staff stated its preference that companies not
book membership fees until refund privileges expired. MemberWorks, a
provider of membership programs offering services and discounts in
a wide range of fields including health care, personal finance, and travel,
altered its accounting in response to SAB 101, effective July 1, 2000. A one-
time noncash charge of $25.7 million resulted, reflecting the deferral of
previously recognized membership fees.
26
A POTPOURRI OF LIBERAL REVENUE
RECOGNITION TECHNIQUES
By intensifying its enforcement of established revenue recognition rules in
SAB 101, the SEC put a stop to techniques that the staff considered overly
aggressive. Professional Detailing, a recruiter and manager of sales staff for
pharmaceutical companies, hadtostopincludinginrevenues thereimburse-
ments that it received from clients for placing help-wanted ads. Within a
month, the company’s share price fell by 31 percent. Physician & Hospi-
tal Systems & Services, a unit of National Data Corporation, abandoned
its long-standing policy of booking revenues for its back-office services not
merelybefore itcompleted thework, but before itmailedout bills.National
Data ended the practice and took a $13.8 million one-time charge to cor-
rect the previous pumping up of revenues. First American Financial took a
cumulative $55.6 million charge when it embraced the matching principle
by beginning to book revenues for loan services over the loan’s duration,
rather than immediately.
27
Percentage-of-Completion Method
Undercertaincircumstances,acompanyengagedinlong-termcontractwork
can book revenue before billing its customer. This result arises from GAAP’s
solution to a mismatch commonly observed at construction firms. A variety
of service companies, defense contractors, and capital goods manufacturers
come up against the same accounting issue.
Typically, the company agrees to bill its customers in several install-
mentsoverthelifeofthecontract.Thebillingmaylagbehindthecompany’s

incurring of expenses to fulfill its obligations. Without some means of cor-
recting this mismatch, reported profit will be inappropriately high in the
contract’s early stages and inappropriately low in the late stages.
The percentage-of-completion method is how GAAP addresses the
problem. It permits the company to recognize revenue in proportion to
the amount of work completed, rather than in line with its billing. The
percentage-of-completion method can rectify the mismatch but may also
entail considerable subjectivity. This is particularly so when the company
specializes in finding creative solutions to particular companies’ unique
problems, a sort of work that cannot be readily measured by engineering
standards.Managementcanspeeduprevenuerecognitiononsuchcontracts
by making assumptions that are liberal yet difficult for the auditors to reject
on objective grounds. As is generally the case with artificial acceleration,
taking liberties with the percentage of completion borrows future revenues,
making a surprise shortfall inevitable at some point.
Crossing the Line
Intheforegoingcases,theregulatorsmerelycomplainedthatthecompanies’
existing revenue recognition policies painted too rosy a picture, but in other
instances,managementhasbeenaccusedofmisrepresentation.Forexample,
in 1996, the SEC claimed that computer manufacturer Sequoia Systems and
four former executives engaged in a “fraudulent scheme” aimed at inflat-
ing the company’s revenue and income. According to the complaint filed
in U.S. District Court in Washington, the ex-chairman and three other offi-
cials booked letters of intent as revenue, backdated some purchase orders,
and granted customers special terms that Sequoia never disclosed. Further-
more, charged the SEC, the executives profited from the scheme by selling
stock before a true picture of the company’s financial condition emerged.
The company and its former officials settled the SEC’s civil charges without
admitting or denying guilt.

FATTENING EARNINGS WITH EMPTY CALORIES
Doughnut maker Krispy Kreme went public at $21 a share in April 2000.
Its stock soared by 76 percent to $37 on the first day of trading. That put
its price-earnings ratio at 78 times, more than triple the multiple on the
Standard & Poor’s Food Index of around 23 times.
Notwithstanding the undeniably addictive quality of its doughnuts,
some analysts thought Krispy Kreme’s shares had risen too high. Investors
were encouraged, however, by a growth rate far in excess of the typical

food company.Same-store sales had jumped by 14 percent in fiscal 2000
(endedJanuary30).Thenumberofstoreshadvaulted20percentto144–58
company-owned and 86 franchised – since the end of fiscal 1998. Whenever
a new store was slated to launch, eager customers lined up in droves to
satisfy their cravings the instant the doors opened. Propelled by consumers’
sugar high, Krispy Kreme shares continued to surge, reaching $108.50 in
November 2000.
The mania could not last forever. In 2003, the pace of new store open-
ings slackened, throwing into question Krispy Kreme’s valuation as a super
growthstock.Atthispoint,accordingtoaSecuritiesandExchangeCommis-
sion complaint released in 2009, Krispy Kreme revised its senior executive
compensation plan.29 Henceforth, officers would receive no bonuses unless
the company reported earnings in each quarter that exceeded its earnings
per shareguidance by at least $0.01.
To continue to clear the bar that it set for itself, the SEC said, manage-
ment began to manipulate certain expense accruals to produce EPS at least
one penny above the guidance. Ultimately, Krispy Kreme strung together
13 consecutive quarters in which it exceeded that threshold. In addition,
said the SEC, Krispy Kreme improperly recorded questionable transactions
involving company purchases of franchised stores.
The Long Slide Begins
On May 7, 2004, the company issued a first-ever profit warning, telling
investors that its earnings would be 10 percent lower than it previously
expected.KrispyKremeblameditsfalteringprofitsonthenewpopularityof
low-carbohydrate diets, but some analysts suspected that the real problem
was overexpansion. They noted that there was no sign of carb conscious-
ness hurting business at rival Dunkin’ Donuts. Krispy Kreme shares, which
had split twice in 2001, suffered a one-day, 29 percent decline on the news.
Later that month, theWall Street Journaldetailed questionable aspects of
the franchise repurchases, based on information by a person familiar with
the transactions.30
In 2003, according to the account, Krispy Kreme began a negotiation
to buy back its struggling seven-store Michigan franchise. Dough-Re-Mi
reportedly owed Krispy Kreme several million dollars for franchise fees,
equipment,andingredientsandwasdelinquentonitspayments.The Journal
reported that the parties reached a preliminary agreement in which Krispy
Kreme asked its franchisee to absorb the cost of closing down two under-
performing stores and to repay past-due interest. Then, according to the
Journal’s informant, Krispy Kreme agreed to increase the purchase price by
the amount of these additional costs.

158 A CLOSER LOOK AT PROFITS
WhywouldKrispyKremetrytorecoverthestore-closingcostsandover-
due interest, only to pay it right back? The motivation might have been to
increase reported earnings. If the transaction was structured as theJournal
stated, the extra money paid out to Dough-Re-Mi became part of an intan-
gible asset, reacquired franchise rights, which would not amortize. That is,
no scheduled, bit-by-bit write-down would reduce future earnings. On the
other hand, when the very same dollars came back to Krispy Kreme, they
wouldberecordedasinterestincome.Inessence,accordingtothe Wall Street
Journal’s story, Krispy Kreme manufactured earnings by taking money out
of one pocket and putting it into another.
ThemoneygiventoDough-Re-Mitocovertheclosingcostsalsobecame
an intangible asset, again assuming theJournal’s account was accurate. Had
Krispy Kreme instead repurchased the franchises and then closed the stores,
it would have incurred an expense. The catch is that an asset is supposed to
be something that creates future economic value. Terminated stores would
not seem to satisfy that definition.
Krispy Kreme’s defense of its accounting was a classic of the genre.
To begin with, said the company, the auditor approved its handling of the
items. This was not a strong justification, judging by the many borderline
actions that corporations’ auditors approve every year. Second, argued
Krispy Kreme, Dough-Re-Mi’s interest payment was unrelated to the
acquisition. By a remarkable coincidence, however, it occurred on the very
same day, and it was deducted from Krispy Kreme’s final remittance to the
franchise seller.
There was yet another strange aspect to the deal. Originally, Krispy
Kreme said it would pay the equivalent of $24.5 million for the Michi-
gan franchise. Later on, the price jumped by 26 percent to $32.1 million.
The company’s chief financial officer claimed that the disparity arose from
an initially incomplete assessment of the costs of the transaction. Krispy
Kreme, he said, should have included in the price the potential added costs
of a promissory note that Dough-Re-Mi’s top executive and major share-
holder took in exchange for agreeing to defer his portion of the purchase
price while he stayed on as a Krispy Kreme employee. Krispy Kreme, how-
ever, dismissed the executive soon after the transaction closed, triggering
a payment $5 million greater than the amount originally attributed to the
promissory note. This extra money, too, became part of the nonamortiz-
ing, intangible asset known as reacquired franchise rights. The shortness
of the interval between the transaction and the increased payment raised
the question whether at least a portion of the disbursement was in sub-
stance a severance payment to the executive. If it had been booked that way,
Krispy Kreme would have realized an immediate expense. Krispy Kreme’s
dubious rebuttal was that the payment was not severance because it went to
Dough-Re-Mi, rather than directly to the executive.

FurtherundercuttingKrispyKreme’scredibilityweredetailsofasecond
franchise repurchase, in northern California. The 10-K filed in May 2002
reported that as of January 2001 CEO Scott Livengood held a 3 percent
share of the franchise. In reality, his stake amounted to 6 percent, but in
August 2001 he ceded 3 percent to his wife as part of a separation agree-
ment. The couple divorced in June 2002. A Krispy Kreme spokeswoman
blamed the 10-K discrepancy on a proofreading error, but the company had
a potential motive for wanting to state as low a figure as possible. Allowing
executives to hold nontrivial stakes in franchises was unusual. Some other
franchised food companies prohibited the practice, viewing it as a conflict
of interest.
On July 29, 2004, Krispy Kreme disclosed that the SEC had opened an
informal inquiry intoitsaccounting practices. The company’s stockplunged
by 16 percent on the news. One focus of the investigation was franchise
repurchases. Camelback Research Alliance noted that Krispy Kreme’s prac-
ticeofnotamortizingthereacquiredrightswasnonstandardinthefranchis-
ing industry. The company parried that it believed the franchise rights had
indefinite lives and therefore should not be written off over time.
Camelback co-founder Donn W. Vickrey also suggested that Krispy
Kreme had paid inflated prices in some franchise repurchases.
31 He noted
that in 2003 the company paid $67.5 million for franchises in Dallas
and Shreveport owned by two former directors. The assets included five
stores and one commissary, a production facility that served off-premises
customers. At the same time, Krispy Kreme was declining to buy back a
southern California franchise that was for sale for a reported $80 million
and held 22 stores. Vickrey questioned whether the California stores
could truly be so much less valuable. The questions about valuation of
the franchise repurchases raised the specter of questionable transactions
with related parties. Taking into account all of Krispy Kreme’s accounting
practices, Camelback gave the company an F for earnings quality, a
designation the research firm customarily awarded only to companies with
three characteristics:
1. Flat or declining fundamentals, providing a motivation to prettify the
financials.
2. Visible evidence of unusual or improper accounting or transactions.
3. Evidence of weak corporate governance.
The Heat Goes Up
Vickrey’s criticisms proved astute. Krispy Kreme’s chief operating officer
resigned less than a month later, a top-level executive change that analyst
Skip Carpenter of Thomas Weisel Partners viewed as a sign of more

problems to come.32 A major earnings disappointment followed later the
same month. The company declined to provide earnings guidance, which is
usually a reason to worry. David Rocker of Rocker Partners further noted
that most, if not all, of the cash on Krispy Kreme’s balance sheet appeared
to have come from a sale-and-leaseback transaction, rather than from

Krispy Kreme could no longer pin its troubles on the low-carbohydrate

company with carelessness in selecting new store locations and failure to
train new franchisees properly. In addition, the company had saturated the

of a long line of customers camped out in sleeping bags, the manager of a

Kreme outlets, and its doughnuts were being sold in Albertsons and H-E-B

A Midwestern franchisee exercised an option to sell 11 percent of its shares

doubtful accounts from two franchisees.
On December 16, 2004, Krispy Kreme conceded that some of the

completion of the ongoing investigation by a special committee of the board
and the outside law firm.
It quickly became clear that the company was not yet out of the woods.
On January 4, 2005, Krispy Kreme said it would reduce its previous year’s
reportedprofitandthatitwouldbeindefaultonits$150millionbankcredit

saidKrispyKreme,itwouldbeunabletohonoritsguaranteesoffranchisees’

that it needed additional credit by the end of March to remain in business.
Bythistime,morethanadozenshareholderlawsuitshadpiledup,including
one alleging that Krispy Kreme had tried to meet investors’ expectations for
earnings growth by ordering some employees to ship more doughnuts than
wholesale customers had ordered.
In response to its deteriorating situation, Krispy Kreme replaced chief
executive Scott Livengood with a turnaround specialist. On February 24,
2005, the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York
launched an investigation on top of the SEC’s ongoing probe. Several new
elements entered the disclosures of financial reporting problems on April 9,
2005, when Krispy Kreme increased the size of the corrections to its fiscal
2004 results from the $3.8 million to $4.9 million range to a range of
$5.2 million to $6.2 million. The previously undisclosed problems involved
derivatives transactions, errors in accounting for leases and improvements
related to leases, and reversal of income related to equipment sold to a
franchisee before Krispy Kreme bought that operation. Management said
further restatements probably would be needed on the last item, as the basis
for recognizing the revenue would be changed to the installation date of the
equipment, rather than the shipping or delivery date.
The Resolution
After 10 months, the board special committee submitted a report of its
investigation. The carefully worded document indicated that although all
employeesandfranchiseeswhowereintervieweddenieddeliberatelydistort-
ing Krispy Kreme’s earnings or being ordered to do so, “the number, nature,
and timing of the accounting errors strongly suggest that they resulted from
an intent to manage earnings.”
34 The report criticized “round-trip transac-
tions” in which money flowed out to franchise sellers, then flowed back in
and was booked as revenue, enabling management to achieve its bogey of
$0.01 above guidance.
The denouement came in 2009, when former CEO Livengood and for-
mer CFOs John Tate and Randy Casstevens settled SEC charges that they
were instrumental in inflating Krispy Kreme’s earnings in an alleged scheme

to increase their compensation. They did not admit or deny the allegations
but agreed to surrender money the SEC said they earned illegally, pay civil
penalties, and be permanently enjoined from committing future violations.
The SEC complaint also alleged that Krispy Kreme management conducted
misleadingconferencecallswithsecuritiesanalysts,helpingtokeepthestock
price higher than it would have been without the alleged financial manipu-
lation, which the SEC said the executives knew about but failed to disclose.
Livengood, Tate, and Casstevens collectively sold approximately 324,000
shares of stock in August 2003, close to the price peak.
Learning Lessons from Doughnuts
KrispyKremewasnotacaseofmassivelyfictitiousearnings.Rather,theSEC
complaint depicted a process of nickel-and-diming, through a wide range of
financial statement items, to beat earnings guidance by $0.01 in every single
quarter. Security analysts found no clear-cut evidence within the reported
numbers that stated profits were inaccurate. Still, users of financial state-
ments can draw some lessons for future reference.
Tobeginwith,anexceptionallylongrecordofbeatingguidanceorpost-
ing year-over-year gains in quarterly earnings is a reason to suspect earnings
management. Businesses tend to grow unevenly over time, reflecting such
factors as the business cycle, waxing and waning of competitive pressures,
and fluctuations in input costs. A second lesson of the Krispy Kreme case
is that related-party transactions and deceptive financial reporting often go
hand in hand. Finally, when management offers an excuse for deteriorating
earningsthatdoesnotstanduptoscrutiny,asKrispyKremedidbycitingthe
low-carb craze, it may be using financial reporting tricks to try to conceal
the true causes.

rities and Exchange Commission initiated an investigation that eventually
led to charges of filing materially misleading financial reports.
The Halliburton affair probably attracted disproportionate attention
for an accounting controversy of less than gargantuan proportions because
of the identity of the chief executive officer on whose watch it occurred.

By the time Halliburton’s tardy disclosure became public knowledge, CEO
Dick Cheney had moved on to become vice president of the United States.
InconvenientlyfortheWhiteHouse,ashareholderlawsuitallegingamassive
scheme to defraud investors was filed against Cheney and other Halliburton
executivesonthedayafterPresidentGeorgeW.Bushcalledforacrackdown
on accounting abuses. Bush advocated tougher prison sentences for corpo-
rate officials engaging in fraud and a strengthening of the SEC’s ability to
uncover financial reporting scams.
Additional embarrassment for the administration arose from Cheney’s
close ties to Arthur Andersen, which incurred massive criticism for its audit-
ing of Enron and ultimately went out of business. In a 2000 memo to his
colleagues, Arthur Andersen’s Terry Hatchett boasted that his relationship
with Cheney was so tight that he remained lead partner on the Halliburton
account even after leaving the Dallas office to head Asian operations. Addi-
tionally, Cheney appeared in a marketing video hailing Arthur Andersen’s
capabilities.
The Accounting Issues
The accounting issues involved cost overruns incurred in construction
projects. Depending on the terms of the contract and the nature of the
overrun, Halliburton could potentially recover the associated cost from a
customer. Prior to 1998, the company recognized income from recovery of
overrun costs in the quarter in which it resolved the claim. Beginning in the
second quarter of 1998, however, Halliburton departed from its traditional
practice and began recognizing revenues by offsetting its losses on certain
projects with estimated probable recoveries on claims that it had not yet
resolved.
Both the old and the new accounting treatment were acceptable under
GAAP. The new treatment, however, boosted reported pretax income by
$200 million between the second quarter of 1998 and the third quarter of
1999. In the fourth quarter of 1998, the change in accounting policy raised

it had changed its accounting policy.
In 2001, Halliburton adopted an even more aggressive approach to
recognizing revenue. For some projects, Halliburton began reporting sales
months before billing customers for the work. Previously, the policy was
to book revenues only if the company expected to bill clients within one
month. In addition, the company began keeping some disputed bills on the

books for over a year instead of writing them off and reporting losses. The
previous policy was to refrain from a write-off only if it believed it would
collectmostoftheclaimwithinoneyear.Asaresultofthischange,disputed
claims doubled from $113 million in 2000 to $234 million in 2001.
Chief Financial Officer Doug Foshee said he could not imagine that
Cheney had specifically approved the 1998 change in accounting policy.
He characterized it as a routine business decision prompted by a shift in
the company’s business mix. Up until the late 1990s, Halliburton worked
mostly under cost-plus contracts, in which it was guaranteed a profit over
whatever costs it incurred. By 1998, most contracts were on a fixed-price
basis. Under this arrangement, the company had to complete the work for
a predetermined fee or else negotiate repayment for cost overruns and for
costs arising from changes in specifications of the work.
Those changed circumstances may well have affected Halliburton’s
accounting policies, but the adoption of a more liberal revenue recognition
policy occurred in the context of pressure on the company’s stock price due
to its 1998 merger with Dresser Industries. Dresser faced potentially large
legal liabilities from asbestos-related litigation. Furthermore, conditions
weredifficultinHalliburton’senergyservicesbusiness.Corporate-widesales
and profits fell in the fourth quarter of 1998 from the year-earlier period.
Halliburton’s financial statements provided further hints that in
response to these pressures the company took liberties to present its results
in a favorable light. When Cheney became CEO in October 1995, the
company had about $0.95 of receivables for each dollar of quarterly rev-
enues. At the end of his tenure, in July 2000, the figure stood at $1.20. This
increase did not appear to reflect a general change in industry conditions.
Over that same span, the average ratio of receivables to sales at five major
competitors declined from $0.92 to $0.86. On the face of it, Halliburton
became more aggressive about booking revenues before getting paid, a
classic technique for pumping up reported earnings.

OnAugust3,2004,theSECannouncedthatHalliburtonanditsformercon-
troller,RobertC.MuchmoreJr.,hadagreedtosettlechargesoffilingmateri-

sizes the importance of complete transparency in a company’s financial dis-
closures. Important information bearing on a company’s results should be

The company and Muchmore neither admitted to nor denied the SEC
charges. Vice President Cheney’s attorney noted that the SEC had investi-
gatedthematterverythoroughlyandhadfoundnoresponsibilityfornondis-
closure on the part of either the board or the CEO. He declined to answer a
question about whether Cheney knew of the effect of the accounting change
on Halliburton’s profits.
Lessons from Halliburton
An auditor’s seal of approval does not guarantee that a company’s financial
reporting is reliable. Arthur Andersen went along with Halliburton’s deci-
sionnottodiscloseanimportantchangeinaccountingpoliciesintheyearin

produced nearly a 50 percent overstatement of pretax earnings. By the by,

Neither should users of financial statements be complacent just because
a prestigious individual has ultimate responsibility for the integrity of the
numbers. Halliburton CEO Dick Cheney was a former congressman, White
House chief of staff, and secretary of defense. By some accounts, he was a
hands-offmanagerwhowouldnothaveconcernedhimselfwiththeaccount-

with accounting matters to praise Arthur Andersen’s work in a marketing

for the company’s industry, users of financial statements should never auto-
matically rule out the possibility that manipulative accounting explains the
disparity.
MANAGING EARNINGS WITH RAINY DAY RESERVES
Overstating near-term reported earnings by recognizing sales prematurely
is the revenue-related abuse that creates the greatest notoriety. Analysts
must also watch out for the opposite sort of finagling, however. Sometimes,
management delays revenue recognition to understate short-run profits.
The motive for this paradoxical behavior is a desire to report the sort of
smooth year-to-year earnings growth that equity investors reward with
high price-earnings multiples (see Chapter 14).
Steadyearningsgrowthrarelyoccursnaturally.Acompanycanproduce
it artificially, however, by creating a rainy day reserve. When net profit hap-
pens to be running above expectations, management stows part of it in a

rainy day reserve. Later on, when the income is needed to boost results to
targetedlevels,managementpullstheearningsoutofstorage.Smoothingthe
bottom line is not uncommon, but companies are touchy about the subject.
Chemical producer W. R. Grace reacted with indignation when it was
accused of managing its earnings through improper reserves. On Decem-
ber 22, 1998, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged the com-
pany and six of its former executives with falsely reporting earnings over
the preceding five years by improperly shifting revenue. Grace followed the
standard script, declaring that it would “vigorously contest”
38 the charges,
statingitsbelief thatitsfinancial reportingwasproper andpointing outthat
its outside auditors had raised no objections to the accounting. An attorney
for former Grace Chief Executive Officer J. P. Bolduc, who was among the
accused executives, said that his client would fight the charges and expected
to be vindicated. The SEC, complained the lawyer, was trying to punish
Bolduc for carrying out his duties exactly as he should have.
The SEC specifically alleged that Grace had declined to report $10 mil-
lion to $20 million of revenue that its kidney dialysis services subsidiary,
National Medical Care (NMC), received in the early 1990s as the result
of a change in Medicare reimbursement rules. According to the commis-
sion’s enforcement division, the Grace executives reckoned that with earn-
ings already meeting Wall Street analysts’ forecasts, the windfall would not
help the company’s stock price. Such an inference would have been con-
sistent with investors’ customary downplaying of profits and losses that
they perceive to be generated by one-time events (see Chapter 3). In fact,
it was possible that the unexpected revenue would actually hurt the stock
price down the road by causing NMC’s profits to increase by 30 percent, an
above-target and unsustainable level.
To solve the perceived problem of excessively high profits at NMC,
Grace’s management allegedly placed the extra revenue in another account,
which it later drew on to increase the health care group’s reported revenues
between 1993 and 1995. As an example, claimed the SEC, senior managers
of Grace asked NMC’s managers to report an extra $1.5 million of income
in the fourth quarter of 1994, when corporate earnings needed a boost.
Brian J. Smith, who was Grace’s chief financial officer until July 1995,
testifiedinadepositionthatbecausethekidneydialysisunitcouldnotmain-

39 His attorney denied, however, that the goal was to
please Wall Street analysts by keeping reported earnings smooth, as former
GraceandNMCemployeesasserted.Smithhadbonafideliabilitiesinmind,
claimed the attorney.
A senior partner at Grace’s auditing firm, Price Waterhouse, did not
agree that the additions to reserves were appropriate. Eugene Gaughan

testified that in 1991, he pointed out that the accounting rules clearly
stated that profits could be set aside only for foreseeable and quantifi-
able liabilities; GAAP did not give companies discretion to create rainy
day funds.
In its year-end audit, Price Waterhouse proposed reversing the reserves,
but management refused. According to the auditing firm’s records, the
Grace executives said that they wanted a “cushion forunforeseen future
events”40 (italics added). Eventually, Price Waterhouse allowed the addi-
tions to reserves to stand. The auditors’ decision reflected a finding that the
amount placed in the reserve was not material from Grace’s corporate-wide
standpoint, although it would be if NMC were a stand-alone company.
(At the time, auditors generally judged an item material if it affected earn-
ings by 5 percent or 10 percent. The Securities and Exchange Commission
later established the criterion that an event was material if it would affect
an investor’s decision.)
According to Gaughan, Price Waterhouse objected again around the
end of 1992, after seeing a memo that described Grace’s use of reserves to
influence reported growth in profits, while gearing NMC executives’ incen-
tive compensation to “actual results.” Another Price Waterhouse partner,
Thomas Scanlon, said that he told Grace CEO Bolduc that stockpiling
reserves was wrong and would have to stop. By that time, the contents of
the rainy day reserve had grown to about $55 million.
It appears, in short, that Grace’s 1998 statement that its auditors had
raisednoobjectionstoitsaccountingfortheMedicarereimbursementwind-
fall was true only in the technical sense that Price Waterhouse issued clean
financials, based on materiality considerations. As a spokeswoman for the
auditing firm pointed out, such an opinion does not imply agreement with
everything in the statements. As late as April 1999, however, Grace was
still insisting that Price Waterhouse had approved its accounting “without
reservation.”
41
On June 30, 1999, Grace settled the case without admitting or deny-
ing the SEC’s charges. The company agreed to cease and desist from further
securities law violations and also to set up a $1 million education fund to
promote awareness of and education about financial statements and gener-
ally accepted accounting principles. Adhering again to the standard script,
thecorporationexplainedthatitsettledthecase“becausewethinkitisinthe
best interests of our employees and shareholders to put this matter behind
us and move forward.”

The Grace affair serves as a reminder that almost invariably, an
allegation of irregularities in corporate financial reporting is followed by a
vehement,formulaicdenial.Nomatterhowoffendedthecompanypurports

of innocence with a grain of salt. The record does not suggest that the
companies that bray loudest in defending their accounting practices are
sure to be vindicated in the end.
FUDGING THE NUMBERS: A SYSTEMATIC PROBLEM
As the preceding examples demonstrate, manipulation of reported revenue
isdistressinglycommon.Readersmayneverthelesswonderwhetherthisdis-
cussion presents too bleak a picture of human nature. Are not most people
basicallyhonest,afterall?Toanoviceanalystwhohasneverbeenblindsided
by revisions of previously reported sales figures that proved misleading or
fraudulent,itmayseemparanoidtovieweverycompany’sincomestatement
with suspicion.
Harvard Business School Professor Emeritus Michael C. Jensen
observes, however, that misrepresenting revenues is the inevitable con-
sequence of using budget targets in employee compensation formulas.
43
“Tell a manager that he will get a bonus when targets are realized and two
things will happen,” writes Jensen. “First, managers will attempt to set easy
targets, and, second, once these are set, they will do their best to see that
they are met even if it damages the company.” He cites real-life examples of
managers who “did their best” through such stratagems as:
■ Shipping fruit baskets that weighed exactly the same amount as their
product and booking them as sales.
■ Announcing a price increase, effective January 2, to induce customers
to order before year-end and thereby help managers achieve their sales
targets.Thepricehikeputthecompanyoutoflinewiththecompetition.
■ ShippingunfinishedheavyequipmentfromaplantinEngland(resulting
in revenue recognition in the desired quarter) to the Netherlands. At
considerable cost and inconvenience, the manufacturer then completed
the assembly in a warehouse located near its customer.
Compounding the problem of managers who play games with their rev-
enues is the willingness of some corporate customers to play along. “All
too often, companies wouldn’t be able to accomplish the frauds without
the assistance of their customers,” observes Helane L. Morrison, a district
administrator for the Securities and Exchange Commission.
44 For example,
one-third of wireless communications provider Hybrid Networks’ revenue
in the fourth quarter of 1997 consisted of a sale made on the final day of
the reporting period to a distributor, Ikon Office Solutions. Ikon agreed to
purchase $1.5 million worth of modems from Hybrid, despite knowing that

side letter essentially permitting Ikon to return the modems without paying
for them. Ikon exercised that option in 1998, yet Ronald Davies, the Ikon
executive who handled the purchase, sent an e-mail to Hybrid denying any
knowledge of the side letter. Unfortunately, Hybrid later gave a copy of the
side letter to its auditors. The SEC then sued Hybrid, which was forced to
restate its revenues to eliminate the nonfinal sale of modems to Ikon. Fur-
thermore, Davies received a cease-and-desist order to refrain from further
violations of the securities laws. In certain other enforcement actions alleg-
ing improper recognition of sales as well, the SEC has charged executives of
corporate customers with collusion.
How widespread are revenue recognition gambits that enrich managers
but impair bona fide profits? According to Ikon executive Davies, “It’s very
common for a manufacturer to call you up and say, ‘I need to hit my quar-
terlynumber,wouldyoumindgivingmeapurchaseorderfor$100,000?”
45
In the litigation surrounding W. R. Grace’s alleged delay of revenue recog-
nition to smooth earnings, the chief financial officer’s attorney defended his
client’s action by arguing, “Any CFO anywhere has managed earnings in
a way the SEC is now jumping up and down and calling fraud.”
46 Michael
Jensenchimesin,“Almosteverycompanyusesabudgetsystemthatrewards
employees for lying and punishes them for telling the truth.” He proposes
reforming the system by severing the link between budget targets and com-
pensation. Realistically, however, radical reforms are not likely to occur any
time soon.
Analyststhereforeneedtoscrutinizecarefullytherevenuesofeverycom-
panytheyexamine.Eveninthecaseofthebluestofthebluechips,watching
for rising levels of accounts receivable or inventory, relative to sales, should
be standard operating procedure. Regardless of management’s programmed
reassurances,conspicuoussurgesinunbilledreceivablesanddeferredincome
are telltale danger signals. It is imperative that analysts raise a red flag when
a membership-based company’s registrations deviate from their customary
relationship with reported sales. “Budget-gaming is rife,” says Jensen, and
“in most corporate cultures, much of this is expected, even praised.” Let the
analyst beware.
Restatements of revenues and earnings arise in a wide range of circum-
stances. Many well-publicized cases involve young companies in compara-
tively new industries. Until the potential abuses have been demonstrated,
management may be able to take greater liberties than the auditors will
countenance at a later point. On the other hand, major, long-established
corporations are sometimes overzealous in booking sales. Mature compa-

InNovember2002,EnterasysNetworksrestateditsrevenuedownward

ing mistakes. The network equipment maker’s net loss for the period rose
by the same amount. (A change in the fiscal year accounted for the unusual
19-month interval.) The purported mistakes that contributed to the elim-
ination of $153 million of sales included revenues booked in the wrong
periods, inflated valuations of stock received as payment for products, and
expected payments that were booked as revenues but failed to materialize
during the 19-month interval. Enterasys was the major surviving subsidiary
ofCabletronSystems,cofoundedbyCraigBenson,whohadjustbeenelected
governor of New Hampshire when the revisions were announced. TheWall
Street Journalreceived no response to its call to a spokesman for the transi-
tion team of governor-elect Benson, who had served on the Enterasys audit
committee since June 2000.
Cincinnati Milacron credited an anonymous tip for its uncovering of a
$2.3 million overstatement of sales in the first half of 1993. The “isolated”
incident, said the company, involved a failure by the Sano plastic machinery
unit to observe the “sales cutoff” rule. Contrary to Cincinnati Milacron’s
policy, Sano had counted in sales units that had not been shipped. The
obligatory firing centered on a senior manager, while others escaped with
reprimands.

First Financial Management blamed accounting errors, rather than pol-
icy violations, for its restatement of revenues for the first nine months of
1991. (Some of the employees at fault were fired, all the same.) The prob-
lem arose in the Basis Information Technologies subsidiary, a unit that First
Financial had formed by consolidating 19 separate companies. Basis Infor-

falsified documents. On May 17, 2004, Lucent and three former executives
agreed to settle, without admitting or denying the allegations, SEC charges
that the company fraudulently and improperly recognized about $1.148
billion of revenue and $470 million in pretax earnings during fiscal 2000.
The SEC complaint asserted that nine current and former Lucent executives
improperly granted or failed to disclose side agreements and other incen-
tives to induce customers to buy the company’s products, all in order to
meet internal sales targets and obtain sales-based bonuses. Furthermore, the

CHAPTER 7
Expense Recognition
A
s Chapter 6 illustrated, companies can grossly distort their earnings
through aggressive revenue recognition. Analysts who arm themselves
with appropriate skepticism about financial statements are bound to
wonder whether companies also pump up the bottom line by taking
liberties in booking expenses. The answer is resoundingly affirmative.
Corporate managers are just as creative in minimizing and slowing down
the recognition of expenses as they are in maximizing and speeding up the
recognition of revenues.
DIAMOND FOODS’S MOVABLE EXPENSES
On February 8, 2012, Diamond Foods announced that it would restate its
earnings for the previous two years. The snack food producer also found
material weaknesses in its financial reporting controls. Chief executive offi-
cerMichaelJ.MendesandchieffinancialofficerStevenM.Neillwereplaced
on administrative leave and fired the following day.
Diamond’s shares fell as much as 44 percent in after-hours trading.
JefferiesstockanalystThiloWredewroteinaresearchbulletinthatthecom-
pany would probably violate its debt covenants as a result of the coming
reduction of reported earnings. In addition, Standard & Poor’s reduced its
outlook for the company’s credit rating from Stable to Slightly Negative.

originallyvaluedat$2.35billion,Diamondwaspoisedtobecomethesecond
largest snack company behind Pepsico, the parent of Frito-Lay. The potato
chip maker’s owner, Procter & Gamble, was to be paid mostly in Diamond
Foods stock.
In the wake of Diamond’s announcement, a P&G spokesperson indi-
cated that Pringles had attracted “considerable interest” from other pos-
sible buyers. The consumer goods giant, he said, would keep its options
open. A week later, P&G pulled the plug on its deal with Diamond, selling
Pringles instead to Kellogg, which thereby snatched the number-two spot in
snack foods.
Early Signs of Trouble
Five months before the restatement announcement that torpedoed Dia-
mond’s share price, theWall Street Journal’s John Jannarone warned that
“investors should take a closer look at its historical business: walnuts.”1
Jannarone’s article followed by two days an Off Wall Street Consulting
report by Mark Roberts that raised questions about Diamond’s accounting.
Roberts estimated that if Diamond had booked its costs properly, fiscal
2011 earnings per share would have been as little as $1.14 a share rather
than the $2.16 that the company reported. Had the company reported the
lower figure, the stock with which it planned to pay for Pringles probably
would have represented much less valuable acquisition currency.
The story began with Diamond Foods’s 1912 origin as a walnut grow-
ers’ cooperative. Michael J. Mendes, the CEO who was fired following the
restatement announcement, persuaded the cooperative’s members to take
the operation public in 2005. He soon began creating a snack food empire
throughacquisitions. Barron’scontributorJannaronenotedthatfrictionhad
developed with growers over multi-year contracts that allowed Diamond to
set walnut prices unilaterally.
When walnut prices surged for the 2010 crop, Diamond paid growers
considerably less than most buyers, according to theWall Street Journal’s
sources. On September 2, 2011, however, Diamond made a “momentum
payment” to growers. A similar “continuity” payment had been made in
August 2010 and growers said they could not tell whether the payments
were for the years in which they were paid or for the preceding years.
Had the September 2011 payment been made by July 31, 2011, the end
of Diamond’s fiscal year, it would have taken a big bite out of fiscal 2011
earnings. Jannarone estimated just how big a hit that might be by conserva-
tively assuming that Diamond bought 20 percent of the 2010 California
walnut crop. (The company had disclosed that in 2005 it bought about
40 percent of the California production.) The Department of Agriculture

Expense Recognition 175
reported the size of the 2010 crop as one billion pounds. At an average of
$0.25 a pound, as growers reported to Jannarone, the momentum payment
would have totaled $50 million, more than half of Diamond’s $93 million
in operating income. That estimate proved close to the approximately $60
million that the company later admitted was recorded in the wrong period.
Even including the 2011 momentum payment, it appeared that walnut
growers had received a bit less than $1.00 a pound from Diamond. The
Department of Agriculture reported an average price of $1.06 a pound for
the 2010 California crop, with some varieties fetching far more. Growers
had the ability to obtain better prices, once their contracts with Diamond
expired, by selling into burgeoning export markets in China and Turkey.
That would spell trouble for Diamond, which derived nearly 30 percent of
its sales from walnuts. Its stock priced had risen 31 percent since the tenta-
tive deal to buy Pringles from P&G was announced, so shareholders faced
substantial downside if Diamond’s nut business began to crack.
Indeed, Diamond’s share price fell by as much as 8.5 percent during
the September 27, 2011, trading session that coincided with theBarron’s
revelations. (The S&P 500 Index rose by 1.0 percent that day.) On Novem-
ber 1, 2011, Diamond and Procter & Gamble agreed to delay the Pringles
closing while Diamond’s audit committee probed the company’s account-
ing for walnut-crop payments. Four days later Bill Alpert presciently wrote
in Barron’s Online, “After Diamond’s walnut accounting gets scrutiny, the
stockcouldgetcrushedagain.”

When Diamond officially restated its earnings on November 15, 2012,
its shares closed at $15.36, down 21 percent on the day. Equity analyst
Ashkay Jagdale of KeyBanc Capital Markets said the size of the restate-
ments was in line with expectations. Diamond, however, also reported a
$53.4 million loss for the first three quarters of 2012, partly due to a weak-
ening of its walnut business. Back when the company was still a Wall Street
darling based on its plan to acquire Pringles, its stock closed at $92.47 on
September 20, 2011.
Notably, Diamond Foods’s earnings manipulation commenced after the
passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that is appropriately credited with sub-
stantially reducing the incidence of financial reporting fraud in the United
States.DiamonddidnotevengopublicuntilthreeyearsafterSarboxbecame

The Aftermath
Nine months after Diamond’s restatement announcement, the company
filed restated consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2010 and 2011 and
interim periods ending January 2010 to July 2011. The revised statements
reduced pretax income by $17 million in fiscal 2010 and by $39.5 million
in fiscal 2011. Two company directors stepped down from the board at
that time.
In 2013 Diamond Foods reached a settlement with investors who
acquired its stock between October 10, 2010, and February 8, 2012. The
company paid $11 million in cash and issued 4.45 million common shares
to resolve all outstanding claims, while denying all claims of wrongdoing
or liability. Insurance funded a substantial portion of the cash payment.
The following year Diamond Foods paid $5 million to settle Securities
and Exchange Commission charges that it concocted an accounting scheme
to falsify its costs. The alleged motive was to increase its earnings and
thereby meet equity analysts’ estimates. Diamond neither admitted nor
denied the charges. Its former chief financial officer Steven M. Neill likewise
settled in 2015 without admitting or denying the charge against him. He
paid $125,000 and forfeited his claim for approximately $1 million in stock
options awarded partly during the time that the alleged fraud occurred.
Deposed chief executive officer Michael J. Mendes followed a similar
route, paying $125,000 and returning more than $4 million in bonuses
andotherbenefits. ThatwasontopofmissingoutonhisscheduledNovem-
ber 2011 headline spot at an investor bash at New York’s Metropolitan

break from his earlier affiliation; Just Desserts proudly stated that itsartisan
baking processes were nut-free.

phone Company of Canada’s department for manufacturing telephones and
telephone equipment, the unit was spun off as the Northern Electric and
Manufacturing Company Limited in 1895. It went through various owner-
ship and name changes, eventually becoming known as Nortel Networks to
signify the company’s quest to dominate the global market for public and
private telecommunications networks.

From the mid-1990s until mid-2000, its market capitalization soared more
than tenfold, and the company shelled out $30 billion for acquisitions. Nor-
tel’s showy advertisements featured celebrities such as Elton John.
The Tech Wreck brought those heady days to an end in 2000. It became
apparent that like many of its high-tech peers, the showpiece of Canadian
industry had paid exorbitant prices for ill-considered acquisitions, extended
credit to customers on unsound terms, and made overly optimistic earnings
forecasts. Between September 2000 and August 2002, Nortel’s market capi-

First Indications of Accounting Discrepancies

the workforce from 95,000 to 35,000 and exiting several major businesses.
The turnaround ran into a snag on October 23, 2003, however. Nortel
announced that it had made accounting “mistakes” that required a reduc-
tion of previously stated losses totaling $740 million for 2000, 2001, 2002,
and the first half of 2003. A review found that the company’s balance sheet
overstated liabilities by $900 million for the period in question, with the
associated losses partly offset by $160 million in corresponding tax bene-
fits. In addition, the company’s second look at its books revealed that $92
million in revenues from the three-and-a-half-year span should have been
deferred to later periods.
Dunn, who had been chief financial officer in 2000 and much of 2001,
explainedthattheerrorsweremadeduringavolatileperiodforthehigh-tech

mitted to working to identify the causes of the mistakes,” said Dunn, “and
to implement the appropriate measures to ensure that the problems will
not recur in the future.”
3 Shareholders were not entirely reassured, as Nor-
tel’s shares fell by 6 percent in after-hours trading. On the whole, though,
investors concluded that because the planned restatements were modest and
would reduce previous losses, the news was not all that bad.

the unusual procedure of putting the executives on leave, rather than firing
them, accounting experts suspected the company’s problems were acute and
might involve a disagreement with auditor Deloitte & Touche.
Some brokerage house analysts, however, continued to express confi-
dence in the company’s outlook. “In my opinion Nortel has made mistakes
in the past, but I’d like to believe that they learned their lesson,”5 com-
mented one analyst who maintained his buy recommendation. An analyst
at an independent equities research firm acknowledged there was an issue
of trust in management but expressed hope that the accounting changes
wouldbeminorandhavelittleimpactonNortel’sshareprice.“Whenyou’re
adjusting prior year numbers, who cares, I’m buying the stock today,”6 the
analyst said.
That remark would prove misguided by a long shot. More skeptical
observers were apt to wonder whether the latest accounting inaccuracies
were truly inadvertent errors. In 2003, Nortel had introduced a special
bonus scheme. Senior executives’ bonuses were tied to profits, and accord-
ing to Toronto’sGlobe and Mail, 16 executives had collected a total of
$43.6 million under the plan. Dunn and Beatty had reportedly received
$2.15 million and $831,000, respectively.7

ingofitsprobe,whichempoweredthecommissiontoissuesubpoenas,might
indicate that Nortel was “not cooperating as much as they say they are.”8
The Ontario Securities Commission was also looking into Nortel’s finan-
cial reporting, and an inquiry by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police later
evolved into a criminal investigation.
Analysts who had downplayed the significance of the accounting reve-
lations were dealt a blow on April 28, 2004. Nortel dropped a bombshell in
the form of a 50 percent cut in its previously announced 2003 earnings of
$732 million. The company said some of those profits would be shifted to
earlier years, for which it reported losses. Nortel also delayed the reporting
of its results for the first quarter of 2003, further damaging its credibility.
In addition to dashing hopes that the new round of accounting state-
ments would be minor, Nortel rattled the market by firing CEO Dunn, CFO
Beatty, and controller Gollogly. They were terminated for cause, but under

Three months later, the company still had not reported any results
for 2004, and it once again delayed the release of its financials. On August
11, 2004, a new chapter opened. Nortel’s investigation, which previously
had focused on accruals and provisions, had turned to revenue recognition.
Thecompanysaidthat$250millionofthe$2.5billionin2000revenuethat
had been slated for shifting to later years would be eliminated altogether.
Incorrect recognition of that amount resulted from a combination of non-
transfer of legal title to customers, failure to meet criteria for recognizing
revenue prior to shipment, collectability questions, and other incorrect
steps. Duncan Stewart, a fund manager with Terra Capital in Toronto, said
Nortel’s senior managers were “looking like clowns”
10 for failing to meet
self-imposed deadlines for filing financial statements and for announcing
major new financial reporting problems after many months of investigating.
On January 10, 2005, Nortel finally filed its 2003 financial statements.
Reflecting the heavy criticism of the board’s oversight of the company’s
accounting, five directors said they would not seek re-election, although
they were not charged with any wrongdoing. In a highly unusual step, 12
senior executives agreed to return $8.6 million in bonuses they received
based on erroneous accounting.

struck a further blow. On January 19, 2009, Nortel filed for bankruptcy
in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The company ini-
tially hoped to reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy, but in June 2009
announced that it would instead liquidate all of its assets.
Lessons from Nortel
Nortel followed a time-honored (albeit not honorable) strategy of taking a
bigbathinitsmoney-losingperiodof2001–2002.Overstatinglossescreated
cookie-jar reserves that could be taken into profits later years. The big bath
strategy is premised on the belief that magnifying an annual loss will not
hurt the stock price as much as magnifying an annual profit will help it in a
subsequent year.
Perhaps even more important in Nortel’s case was the impact on
bonuses that were paid as a function of returning to profitability. This
was the arrangement for most Nortel employees even before the new plan
for senior executives was adopted in 2003. In this sort of scheme, current
bonuses are not reduced from zero if a reported loss is pumped up through
unjustified accruals, but future bonuses are increased if those accruals are
taken into profits later on, in a profitable year.
Based on past examples of big baths and cookie jar reserves, investors’
muted reaction to the October 2003 announcement of a restatement, on
the grounds that it lowered previously reported losses, was naive. Nortel’s
experienceshowsthatifacompanyusesaccrualstounderstateprofits,itwill
have no compunction about overstating profits through aggressive revenue
recognition. Instead of blowing over, the 2003 announcement proved to be
the beginning of a situation that kept getting worse and worse.
The accruals that Nortel abused arose from contractual liabilities. For
example, suppose the company missed a deadline on a $5 million contract
and reasonably estimated the failure would cost it $500,000 through a cus-
tomer refund. The amount of the expected refund would be booked as an
expense, reducing current-year profits, and would be recorded as a liability
until it was paid. If the customer subsequently agreed to accept a refund of
only $300,000, the remaining $200,000 would be recognized as a profit in
theperiodinwhichtherefundwaspaid.TheinvestigationbyNortel’sboard
found that in 2003 management raided the cookie jar, taking reserves off its
balance sheet without legitimate triggers for doing so. Furthermore, man-
agement overstated the reserves to create a bigger cookie jar into which it
could dip.
Abuse of accruals was deeply embedded in Nortel’s culture. Executives
usedtheterm hardness todescribethestateofhavingamplereservesinplace
to draw on later as a means of managing earnings. TheWall Street Journal

got access to an internal company document showing quarterly earnings
targets. During the first half of 2003, the profit line kept rising as another
number labeledbalance sheetalso kept changing, suggesting that manage-
ment was generating the earnings increases by drawing on reserves.
11
For internal purposes that included calculation of bonuses, Nortel
used a figure it called “pro forma income.” Its initial, publicly reported net
income for the first quarter of 2003 was $54 million. The internal figure,
on the other hand, included approximately $361 million in reserves, of
which roughly $160 million was inappropriately reversed, according to the
board’s investigation. In the second quarter, Nortel publicly reported a $14
million loss, but the pro forma profit was $34 million, triggering bonuses
of 10 to 25 percent of annual salary for most employees and two to four
times salary for top managers, once four quarters of cumulative profits
were recorded. Ultimately, the scheme unraveled when the board ordered
management to clean up the company’s balance after years of accumulated
reserve accounting that gave rise to confusion.
An important takeaway from the Nortel case is that seemingly small
items can prove highly significant. Investors paid little attention to a few
hundred million dollars of reserve-related losses in the context of a total
of $34 billion of losses recorded from 2000 to 2004. Those additions to
reserves, however, added to accrued liabilities that grew to $5 billion by
the summer of 2002, giving management a vast opportunity to manipulate
earnings to enhance its bonuses.
GRASPING FOR EARNINGS AT GENERAL MOTORS

going by the book on accounting matters, but that culture may change if
profitability starts to erode.
General Motors (GM) illustrated this pathology as its fortunes dete-

12 During its long reign as the world’s largest
automaker, GM displayed all the insignia of a blue chip. When it was first
rated by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s in 1953, the company achieved

the top ranking of AAA. Far from cutting corners in its financial reporting,
GM in its heyday exceeded the requirements, providing investors audited
financial statements before it became mandatory under the Securities Act
of 1933.
Overtime,however,GMlostitscommandingpositionintheautoindus-

nent of looser accounting standards at hearings of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board.
By2005,GM’sbondratingshadslidallthewaytothespeculativegrade
category, at BB. In the same year, disturbing signs began to surface that an
aggressive approach to financial reporting had become embedded in GM’s
corporate culture. On October 26, 2005, the company disclosed that the
Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating various aspects of
itsaccounting. Theprobe,repletewithsubpoenas, addressedaccounting for
retirement benefits; certain transactions with Delphi, a bankrupt supplier
that was formerly a division of GM; and the treatment of recovery of recall
costs from suppliers.
On November 9, 2005, GM announced that it would have to restate
its financial results for 2001 and possibly for subsequent years. The com-
panysaidithad“erroneously”bookedcreditsfromsuppliers,resultinginan
overstatement of 2001 income by $300 million to $400 million.

originally showed in its 2001 annual report. The figure was down from
$4.45 billion in 2000, underscoring the intense earnings pressure that GM
was feeling.
At issue in GM’s restatement was the recording of rebates and other
credits from suppliers. The accounting rules stated that if the rebates
involved not only current business but were upfront inducements to place
large orders over several years, they should be taken into earnings over
time, rather than booked immediately. In March 2005, Chief Financial
Officer John Devine had stated that GM’s “very clear” policy was to take
no rebates from suppliers. In conjunction with the announcement of a
coming restatement, however, spokeswoman Toni Simonetti backtracked
on that claim. “I will say that some years ago we did say that we would
generally discontinue this practice and generally we have,” she explained.
“I’m not sure if it’s been stopped completely across the board.”

Judging by the range of accounting practices that the SEC was look-

isolated incident, but symptomatic of widespread aggressiveness in GM’s
reporting. Coincident with its November 9, 2005, restatement announce-
ment, the company disclosed that it had evaluated the effectiveness of its
controls and procedures for determining whether assets should be deemed
impaired and written off. Chairman Rick Wagoner said that he and CFO
Devine had concluded that the company’s controls were not effective at the
SEC-defined “reasonable assurance level.” As a result, GM had failed to
reduce the value of its investment in Fuji Heavy Industries, the producer of
Subaru cars, in a timely manner.
Yet another blow to the credibility of GM’s financial reporting arrived
on March 16, 2006. The company said that some cash flows from its mort-
gagesubsidiarythatshouldhavebeenclassifiedamongitsinvestingactivities
wereinsteadbookedasoperatingactivities.Thisrevelationpuzzledaccount-
ing experts because the applicable rules were unambiguous. Extending a
loan or receiving repayment fell into investing activities; interest payments
were included in operating cash flow. It was difficult to see how an error
could arise.
Similarly troubling was GM’s revelation that in 2000 it booked a $27
million gain on the sale of precious metals in its inventory, even though
it had agreed to repurchase the metals the following year. The repurchase
agreement made the transaction a financing, rather than a sale, so the com-
panyshouldhaverecordednoincome.Runningafoulofsuchafundamental
accounting principle did not sound like an honest mistake. Rather, it had
the scent of a transaction concocted for no economic purpose but rather to
generate reported earnings at a company desperate to appear profitable.
It further developed that GM’s aggressive accounting had not ended in
2000–2001. The company told investors that it had understated its loss
in 2005’s first quarter by $149 million. Management said it had prema-
turely increased the value of vehicles it was leasing to car-rental companies,
assuming they would be worth more after those companies were through
with them.

TIME-SHIFTING AT FREDDIE MAC
Ordinarily, a company’s stock price rises when its reported earnings
unexpectedly increase. The opposite occurred, however, after Freddie Mac
announced on January 22, 2003, that it would revise upward its earnings
for previous years. Between January 21 and January 23, the mortgage
finance company’s shares fell nearly 5 percent while the S&P 500 Index was
essentially unchanged.
The explanation of this seemingly strange response was the concern
that the announcement raised among investors about the reliability of
the financial statements of the government-sponsored enterprise (GSE)
officially known as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Even
before the news, investors were apprehensive about the complexity of
Freddie Mac’s accounting. Anxiety increased when the company’s auditor,
PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), raised questions about the way the com-
pany treated past accounting for certain hedging transactions. After Arthur
Andersen surrendered its licenses to audit public companies following its
conviction on criminal charges relating to its handling of Enron’s audit (see
Chapter 11), PwC had taken over as Freddie Mac’s auditor. When PwC
reviewed the 2002 results, it questioned company accounting decisions that
ArthurAndersenhadapproved, raisingthepossibilitythatfurtherproblems
would emerge.
Freddie Mac steadfastly denied that its handling of derivatives was
aimed at smoothing its earnings. That is, the company contended that it did
not deliberately hold down its reported profits during good times, making it
easiertolaterpostthesteadyearningsincreasesthatsecurityanalystscraved.
On June 25, 2003, however, Freddie Mac admitted that in some instances it
manipulated its earnings to match Wall Street earnings forecasts. Manage-
ment nevertheless claimed that most of the understatement of net income
for 2000 through 2002, which it estimated at $1.5 billion to $4.5 billion,
was accidental. (The figure rose to nearly $5 billion by the time a review of
the company’s financial reporting was completed in November 2003.)
Even if it was true that intentional misrepresentations were the lesser
part of the earnings understatement, the company’s questionable practices
had a huge impact that even conscientious analysts could not detect from

the outside. Freddie Mac time-shifted $420 million of pro forma profits (the
measure the company was then urging investors to focus on) through linked
swaps. In these transactions, the company bet on a rise in interest rates at
the same time that it bet on a decline in interest rates. The net economic
benefit was nil, and there was minimal business justification for the swaps,
other than altering the timing of profits. Freddie Mac structured the swaps
such that it made its payments in one month and received payment for the
offsettingtradeinthefollowingmonth.Thatreducednetincomeinoneyear
and raised it in the next.
Freddie Mac’s non-economically driven financial engineering also
displayed a characteristic frequently observed in accounting manipulation,
namely snowballing misrepresentation. The company initiated its use of
linked swaps in 2001 because falling interest rates were creating an earnings
blizzard. If interest rates had leveled off, bringing profits down to a more
normal growth rate, Freddie Mac could have begun working down the
earnings reserve it had created. Instead, rates continued to fall. To keep the
game going and avoid reporting an unwanted earnings spike, management
had to undertake bigger and bigger linked-rate swaps. The final swap
shifted more income than the first eight combined.
15
Freddie Mac’s manipulation did not end there. Another ploy to hide
earnings consisted of ceasing to use market prices for certain derivatives.
Outside investigators labeled this action “results-oriented, reverse engi-
neered, and opportunistic.”
16 Incredibly, it turned out that after all of
management’s maneuvers were stripped away, the net effect was that the
company overstated its 2001 earnings by almost $1 billion.
Encouragingly, from the standpoint of dissuading future abusers of
GAAP, Freddie Mac’s misdeeds brought retribution. The board fired the
company’s president and obtained the resignations of its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer. The CEO was succeeded by the former
chief investment officer, but he, too, eventually lost his job after his role in
the linked-rate swaps came to light. In addition, the company paid a $125
million fine in a settlement with the Office of Federal Enterprise Oversight.
The regulator’s report traced the origins of Freddie Mac’s inappropriate
practices back to the mid-1990s.
Furthermore, the revelations about Freddie Mac’s accounting practices
lent fuel to politicians’ intent on reining in Freddie Mac and its fellow GSE,
Fannie Mae. The two companies later became central figures in the financial
crisisof2008andwereplacedundergovernmentconservatorship.Financial
reporting issues were not the immediate cause of their fall from grace, but
they were symptomatic of unhealthy corporate cultures that led to unsound
financial practices.

CONCLUSION
Justascompanieshavemyriadwaysofexaggeratingrevenues,theyfollowa
variety of approaches in downplaying expenses. Corporate managers make
liberal assumptions about costs that may be capitalized, pile up unjusti-
fied accruals, dilute expenses with one-time gains, relocate them in time,
and jump the gun in booking rebates from suppliers. These gambits are
often exceedingly difficult to detect in companies’ public financial state-
ments, but seemingly minor yet unprecedented or unconventional entries
can foreshadow major restatements. To pick up such clues, analysts must be
disciplined enough to disbelieve the innocent explanations that companies
routinely provide for abnormalities that point to trouble down the road.

CHAPTER 8
The Applications and Limitations
of EBITDA
A
s noted in Chapter 3, corporations have attempted to break free of the
focus on after-tax earnings that historically dominated their valuation
and continues to be the key focus of Wall Street research. The impetus for
trying to redirect investors’ focus to operating income or other variants has
been the minimal net profits recorded by manyNew Economycompanies.
Conventionally calculated price-earnings (P/E) multiples of such companies,
most inconveniently, make their stocks look expensive. Old Economy com-
panies generally have larger denominators (the E in P/E), so their multiples
look extremely reasonable by comparison.
Long before the dot-com companies of the 1990s began seeking alter-
natives to net income, users of financial statements had discovered certain
limitations in net income as a valuation tool. They observed that two com-
panies in the same industry could report similar income yet have substan-
tially differenttotal enterprise values. Similarly, credit analysts realized that
in a given year, two companies could generate similar levels of income to
cover similar levels of interest expense yet represent highly dissimilar risks
of defaulting on their debt in the future.
The earnings per share figure was not, despite equity investors’ obses-
sion with it, a standard by which every company’s value and risk could be
fairlycompared.Hadanalyststhoughtdeeplyabouttheproblem,theymight
have hypothesized thatno single measure could capture financial perfor-
mance comprehensively enough to fulfill such a role. Instead, they set off
on a quest for the correct single measure of corporate profitability, believing
in its existence as firmly as the conquistadors who set off in search of El
Dorado.

EBIT, EBITDA, AND TOTAL ENTERPRISE VALUE
Whenequityanalystsrecommendacompany’sstock,theytypicallyhighlight
its prospects for earnings growth. They may also apply various valuation
metrics to argue that the stock is cheap relative to others they consider com-
parable. Sometimes, analysts also allude to upside related to the company’s
attractiveness as an acquisition target. An acquirer generally has to pay a
significant premium to the prevailing share price to consummate the deal.
The fictitious example in Exhibit 8.1 helps to bring out the shortcomings of
after-tax earnings in estimating a company’s “takeout value” in the acquisi-
tion scenario.
Suppose a suitor has a choice between acquiring thingamabob manu-
facturer Deep Hock Corporation and its direct competitor Breathing Room
Inc. Assuming the going rate for acquisitions in the thingamabob industry
is 25 times net income, Breathing Room is far more valuable, at 25× $24.0
million = $600 million, versus 25× $19.8 million= $495 million for Deep
Hock. On the face of it, the higher valuation on Breathing Room is surpris-
ing,givenitsmuchlowerrateofreturnonequity(netincome ÷shareholders’
equity), i.e., 12.0 percent versus 18.0 percent on Deep Hock.
That paradox is explained by the contrast between Breathing
Room’s debt-free balance sheet and Deep Hock’s comparatively aggressive
financial leverage:

Debt-to-Total Capital= Total Debt
Total Debt+Shareholders’ Equity
= $90.0
$90.0+$110.0
= 45%
The difference in valuation created by nonequivalent debt ratios
does not truly affect an acquired company’s post-acquisition value to the
acquirer. For example, if the acquirer operates Breathing Room as a sepa-
rately financed subsidiary, it can boost the return on its equity investment
in the subsidiary by adding debt to Breathing Room’s capital structure. On
the other hand, if the acquirer’s own balance sheet is debt-free, it may retire
Deep Hock’s debt. (Note that the need to pay off Deep Hock’s debt will
affect the amount of cash the acquirer will pay for the shares.)
A further complication in the calculations is that all things being equal,
a leveraged company’s price-earnings ratio will be lower than an unlever-
aged company’s. That is because leverage increases earnings volatility
and investors prefer steady earnings to volatile earnings. In our example,
Deep Hock would have been trading at the same price-earnings multiple
pre-acquisition as Breathing Room only if it surpassed Breathing Room in
other multiple-enhancing characteristics.
For all these reasons, it would not in fact make sense for a would-be
acquirer to apply a single multiple of earnings across the board to all
potential acquirees within a given industry. To remove from the picture
the incumbent managements’ financial strategies, which will cease to be
relevant following the acquisition, the acquirer can apply a multiple of
earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT. In our example, applying an
EBIT multiple of 20 times would produce the same acquisition price for
both Deep Hock and Breathing Room:
Deep Hock Breathing Room
Net income $19.8 $24.0
+ Taxes 5.2 6.4
+ Interest 5.4 0.0
EBIT $30.4 $30.4

The Applications and Limitations of EBITDA 191
Another advantage of calculating total enterprise value as a multiple of
EBITDA had to do with countering financial reporting trickery. If a target
company uses liberal depreciation accounting to inflate its earnings, adding
back depreciation puts it on an equal footing with a company that employs
a more conservative approach.
Exhibit 8.2 shows how Conniving Corp.’s management has planned to
report the company’s annual earnings before learning, in the weeks between
year-end and the scheduled date for filing its financial statements, that the
private equity firm Middlebelt Partners is interested in proposing an LBO
deal.Conniving’sC-suiteexecutivesnaturallywanttomaximizethevalueof
their stock options. Chief Financial Officer Evan Chewley hatches a creative
solution.
Currently, Conniving’s stock is trading at 20 times earnings of $163
million, producing a $3.260 billion market capitalization. Based on terms
of recent LBOs, management can expect the company to fetch a 30 per-
cent premium, or a multiple of 26 times and a market capitalization of
$4.238 billion. CFO Chewley points out that Conniving can boost its 2020
net income by the simple expedient of revising from eight to ten years the

average depreciable lives of its fixed assets, or property, plant, and equip-
ment. With that switch to a more liberal practice, depreciation expense will
fall by $24 million. Of that amount, $19 million will drop to the bottom
line. At the expected LBO multiple of 26 times, Middlebelt will pay $494
million more for Conniving than under the old accounting.
Some readers may wonder whether an abrupt shift from an eight- to
a ten-year depreciation schedule is a realistic plan for Conniving. In 2016,
the luxury brand company Prada announced, not in connection with any
M&Aplans,thatitwould enditspolicyofcapping thedepreciation periods
on its store leases at ten years. Some of its leases ran as long as 18 years,
althoughtheaveragewasabouteightyears.Thisliberalizationwasexpected
to increase full-year 2016 earnings by around 50 million euros, or about
$56 million at the then-prevailing exchange rate, with no impact on cash
flow. Based on this real-world example, fictional CFO Chewley’s scheme is
definitely feasible.
Luckily for their investors, Middlebelt’s negotiators know the ins and
outs of financial reporting. They realize that lengthening the lives of depre-
ciable assets generates no incremental cash. (Conniving already employs a
more accelerated depreciation schedule in its tax reporting.) Middlebelt will
not shell out an extra $494 million for a change in accounting practices.
Basing the acquisition price on EBIT rather than net income would go
some way toward maintaining Conniving’s comparability with companies
that adhere to its industry’s customary accounting standards. At a multi-
ple of 15 times, the valuation gap created by the switch to ten-year average
lives declines from $494 million to $360 million. Middlebelt can eliminate
the gap altogether, though, by insisting on using a multiple of EBITDA to
determinetheacquisitionprice.EBITDAis$397million,regardlesswhether
Connivingusesthemoreconservativeorthemoreliberaldepreciationsched-
ule. Either way, an EBITDA multiple of 11 times produces a $4.367 billion
acquisition price. EBITDA’s popularity as a valuation tool derives in part
fromthisattributeoflevelingtheplayingfieldincomparisonsofcompanies’
valuations.
Useful though EBITDA is in foiling this particular ploy that involves
depreciation accounting, analysts involved in acquisitions should not jump
totheconclusionthatthestartingpointofeverynegotiationisanumberthat
buyers and sellers can safely accept at face value. Whether they are trying
to attract a higher price from an acquirer or engineer a higher valuation
in the stock market, corporate managers frequently try to shift attention to
“adjusted EBITDA” rather than the GAAP version.

often is, bona fide synergies do emerge from many merger-and-acquisition
transactions. If an entire layer of the acquiree’s management will be elimi-
nated through consolidation with the acquirer, it is reasonable to modify
the historical EBITDA figure for that predictable saving. Less defensible are
some attempts to substitute arun ratefor a short period – in extreme cases,
as little as one month – for actual results over the latest 12 months. That
sort of adjusted EBITDA can be upwardly skewed by seasonal factors or
special events such as new-product launches.

For convenience of exposition, we refer to this standard credit measure
as the EBIT-based coverage ratio. Note that for some companies, the sum
of net income, income taxes, and interest expense is not equivalent to EBIT,
reflecting the presence of such factors as extraordinary items and minority
interest below the pretax income line.

$875.0+675.0 = 56.5%
By these criteria, lending to Hollowman, Inc. is as safe a proposition as
lending to Rock Solid Corp. Bringing EBITDA into the analysis, however,
reveals that Rock Solid is better able to keep up its interest payments in the
event of a business downturn.
In the current year, Rock Solid’s gross profit – $2,000 million sales less
$1,600 million cost of goods sold – is $400 million. Suppose that through a
combination of reduced revenue and margin deterioration, the figure drops
by 55 percent to $1,800 million− $1,620 million = $180 million, while
other operating expenses remain constant (Exhibit 8.4). Net income now
comes to −$53.7 million. Adding to that a $14.3 million tax credit and
$58 million of interest expense produces EBIT of−$10.0 million.
Is Rock Solid truly unable to pay the $58 million interest on its debt?
No, because the $75.0 million of depreciation and amortization charged
against income is an accounting entry, rather than a current-year outlay of
cash. Adding back these noncash charges shows that the company keeps its
head above water, covering its interest by a margin of 1.29 times:

Rock Solid can sustain a larger decline in gross margin than Hollow-

In summary, conventionally measured fixed charge coverage is nearly
identical for the two companies, yet they differ significantly in their prob-
ability of defaulting on interest payments in a cyclical downturn. Taking

ABUSING EBITDA
Likemanyotherfinancialratios,EBITDAcanprovidevaluableinsightwhen
used properly. It is potentially misleading, however, when applied in the
wrongcontext.Atip-offtothepossibilityofabuseisapparent fromthepre-
ceding illustration. By adding depreciation to the numerator, management
can emphasize (legitimately, in this case) that although Rock Solid’s oper-
ating profits make no contribution toward paying its 2020 interest bill, the
companyisgenerating147percentasmuchcashasitneedsforthatpurpose.
In their perennial quest for cheap capital, LBO sponsors are keenly
aware of the comfort that lenders derive from a fixed charge coverage ratio
comfortably above 1X, sometimes paying too little attention to the means
by which it is achieved. To exploit the effect as fully as possible, sponsors
strive to steer credit analysts’ focus away from traditional fixed charge cov-
erage and toward EBITDA coverage of interest. Shifting investors’ attention
was particularly beneficial during the 1980s, when some buyouts were so
highly leveraged that projected EBIT would not cover pro forma interest
expense even in a good year. The sponsors reassured nervous investors
by ballyhooing EBITDA coverage ratios that exceeded the psychologically
criticalthresholdof1.0times.Meanwhile,thesponsors’investmentbankers
insinuated that traditionalists who fixated on sub-1.0X EBIT coverage
ratios were hopelessly antiquated and self-defeatingly conservative in their
analysis.
In truth, a bit of caution is advisable in the matter of counting deprecia-
tiontowardinterestcoverage.TheargumentforfavoringtheEBITDA-based

depreciation to the numerator is appropriate only for the period over which
a company can put off a substantial portion of its capital spending without
impairing its future competitiveness.
Over a full operating cycle, the capital expenditures reported in a com-
pany’s statement of cash flows are ordinarily at least as great as the depre-
ciation charges shown on its income statement. The company must repair

for the replacement of obsolete equipment. If anything, capital spending is
likely to exceed depreciation over time, as the company expands its produc-
tive capacity to accommodate rising demand. Another reason that capital
spending may run higher than depreciation is that newly acquired equip-
ment may be costlier than the old equipment being written off, as a function
of inflation.
In view of the ongoing need to replace and add to productive capacity,
the cash flow represented by depreciation is not truly available for paying
interest, at least not on any permanent basis. Rather, theDin EBITDA is a
safety valve that the corporate treasurer can use if EBIT falls belowI for
a limited time. Under such conditions, the company can temporarily reduce
itscapitalspending,freeingupsomeofitsdepreciationcashflowforinterest
payments. Delaying equipment purchases and repairs that are essential, but
not urgent, should inflict no lasting damage on the company’s operations,
provided the profit slump lasts for only a few quarters. Most companies,
however, would lose their competitive edge if they spent only the bare mini-
mumonproperty,plant,andequipment,yearafteryear.Itwasdisingenuous
for sponsors of the most highly leveraged buyouts of the 1980s to suggest
thattheircompaniescouldremainhealthywhilepayinginterestsubstantially
greater than EBIT over extended periods.
Naturally, the sponsors were prepared with glib answers to this objec-
tion. Prior to the buyout, they claimed, management had been overspending
on plant and equipment. The now-deposed chief executives allegedly had
wasted billions on projects that were monuments to their egos, rather than
economically sound corporate investments. In fact, the story went, invest-
ments in low-return projects were the cause of the stock becoming cheap
enough to make the company vulnerable to takeover. Investors ought to
be pleased, rather than alarmed, to see capital expenditures fall precipi-
tously after the buyout. Naturally, this line of reasoning was less persua-
sive in cases where the sponsors teamed up with the incumbent CEO in a
management-led buyout.
With the benefit of hindsight, the assumptions behind many of the
LBOs’ financial projections were extremely aggressive. Often, the pro-
jections optimistically assumed that the huge debt repayment obligations
would be financed with the proceeds of asset sales. The sponsors declared
that they would raise immense quantities of cash by unloading supposedly
nonessential assets.
Still,thesponsors’argumentswerenotentirelyunfounded.Atleastsome
of the vast, diversified corporations that undertook leveraged buyouts dur-
ing the 1980s had capital projects that deserved to be canceled. Some of

A MORE COMPREHENSIVE CASH FLOW MEASURE
Despite some shortcomings as a tool for quantifying credit risk, EBITDA
has become a fixture in securities analysis. Many practitioners now consider
the ratio synonymous with cash flow or, more formally, operating cash flow
(OCF). The interchangeability in analysts’ minds of EBITDA and OCF is
troubling in light of a long tradition of empirical research linking genuine
cash flow and bankruptcy risk.
Inaninfluential 1966study,
2 WilliamH.Beaver testedvarious financial
ratios as predictors of corporate bankruptcy. Among the ratios he tested
was a definition of cash flow still widely used today. Cash flow (as defined
by Beaver, 1966) is:
Net Income+Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization
(Depletion,anoncashexpenseappliedtonaturalresourceassets,isordi-
narily taken to be implicit in depreciation and amortization, hence the use
of the acronym EBITDA, rather than EBITDDA.)
Beaver found that of all the ratios he tested, the best single predictor of
bankruptcywasadecliningtrendintheratioofcashflowtototaldebt.This
relationship made intuitive sense. Practitioners reasoned that bankruptcy
risk was likely to increase if net income declined or total debt increased,
either of which would reduce the cash-flow-to-total-debt ratio. The empiri-
calevidenceindicatedthatbyaddingdepreciationtothenumerator,analysts
improvedtheirabilitytopredictwhichcompanieswouldgobust,relativeto
comparing total debt with net income alone.
Note that Beaver’s definition of cash flow was more stringent than
EBITDA, since he did not add back either taxes or interest to net income.
Even so, bond analysts have developed a tradition of telescoping default
risk into the single ratio of cash flow (by which they mean EBITDA) as a
percentage of total debt, all based ultimately on Beaver’s 1966 finding.

In so doing, practitioners have institutionalized a method that Beaver never
advocatedandthatsubsequentexperiencehasshowntobeseriouslyflawed.
Beaverdidnotconcludethatanalystsshouldrelyexclusivelyontheratio
of cash flow to debt ratio, but merely that it was the single best bankruptcy
predictor. As he noted in his study, other academic researchers were already
attempting to build bankruptcy models with greater predictive power by
combining ratios into amultivariate analysis. As of 1966, no one had yet
succeeded, but just two years later, Edward I. Altman introduced a multi-
variate model composed of five ratios
4 (see Chapter 13). The development
ofAltman’sZ-Scoreandothermultivariatemodelshasdemonstratedthatno
singlefinancialratiopredictsbankruptcyasaccuratelyasaproperlyselected
combination of ratios.
Since1968,therehasbeennoexcuseforreducingbankruptcyrisktothe
sole measure of EBITDA to total debt. Nevertheless, that procedure remains
common shorthand for credit risk. Similarly unjustifiable, on the basis of
empirical evidence, is the widely used single-variable approach of ranking
a sample of corporate borrowers according to their EBITDA coverage of
interest.
Bizarrely, investment managers sometimes ask bond analysts to provide
rankings of companies by their “actual credit risk,” as opposed to Moody’s,
Standard & Poor’s, or Fitch ratings. Asked to elaborate on this request, the
investment managers reply that actual riskobviously means EBITDA cov-
erage. Apparently, they consider it self-evident that the single ratio of cash
flow (as they define it) to fixed charges predicts bankruptcy better than all
oftheratingagencies’quantitativeandqualitativeconsiderationscombined.
Littledotheinvestmentmanagersrealizethattheyaresettingcreditanalysis
back by more than half a century!
Nearly as outmoded as exclusive reliance on a single EBITDA-based
ratio is certain analysts’ belief that they can derive a satisfactory measure
of cash flow by simply selecting some version of earnings and adding back
depreciation. It became apparent that neither EBITDA nor net income
plus depreciation was a valid proxy for cash flow at least as far back as
1975, when W. T. Grant filed for bankruptcy. The department store chain’s
collapse showed that reliance on an earnings-plus-depreciation measure
could cause analysts to overlook weakness at a company with substantial
workingcapitalneeds.Manysubsequentfailuresintheretailingandapparel

a remote prospect, even though the company’s net income failed to grow
between the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1973, W. T. Grant’s stock traded
at 20 times earnings, indicating strong investor confidence in the company’s
future. The board of directors reinforced that confidence by continuing to
authorize dividends until mid-1974.
Investors would have been less sanguine if they had looked beyond the
cash sources (earnings and depreciation) and uses (interest and dividends)
shown on the income statement. It was imperative to investigate whether
two balance sheet items, inventories and accounts receivable, were tying
up increasing amounts of cash. If so, it became vital to determine whether
the company could generate an offsetting amount of cash by expanding
its accounts payable. Recognizing the need for this added level of analysis,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) eventually prescribed
a more comprehensive definition of operating cash flow, as defined in
SFAS 95, “Statement of Cash Flows.”
Operating cash flow (as defined by FASB, 1987):
Net Income+Depreciation−Changes in Working Capital Requirements

where:
Working Capital Requirements= Accounts Receivable+Inventory
−Accounts Payable
Note that this definition focuses on the elements of working capital
that ordinarily grow roughly in proportion with the scale of operations.
The FASB formulation excludes cash and marketable securities, as well as
short-term debt.
WORKING CAPITAL ADDS PUNCH TO CASH FLOW ANAL YSIS
Adding working capital to cash flow analysis frequently reveals problems

ging its feet on writing off unsalable merchandise or postponing write-offs
offbadreceivables,meaningthatcurrentearningsareoverstated.Naturally,
management invariably offers a more benign explanation.
Consider, for example, an apparel manufacturer that must produce its
garments before knowing which new styles will catch the fancy of shoppers
in the season ahead. Suppose that management guesses wrong about the
fashion trend. The company now holds inventory that can be sold, if at all,
only at knockdown prices. Instead of selling the unfashionable garments,
which would force the manufacturer to recognize the loss in value, manage-
ment may decide to retain them in its finished goods inventory. Accounting
theory states that the company should nevertheless recognize the loss by
writing down the merchandise. In practice, though, management may per-
suade its auditors that no loss of value has occurred. After all, judging what
is fashionable is a subjective process. Furthermore, management can always
argue that the goods remain in its warehouse only because of a temporary
slowdown in orders. If the auditors buy the story, it will not alter the fact
that the company has suffered an economic loss. Analysts focusing exclu-
sively on EBITDA will have no inkling that earnings are down or that the
company’ cash resources may be starting to strain.

In contrast, analysts will recognize that something is amiss if they mon-
itor a cash flow measure that includes working capital in addition to net
income and depreciation. While the current season’s goods remain in inven-
tory, the company is producing clothing for the next season. Observe what
happens to working capital requirements, bearing in mind the FASB 95 def-
inition, as the new production enters inventory:
Working Capital Requirements= Accounts Receivable
+Inventory−Accounts Payable
Inventory rises, causing working capital requirements to increase.
According to the FASB definition, a rise in working capital requirements
reduces operating cash flow. Analysts receive a danger signal, even though
net income plus depreciation advances steadily.
A surge in accounts receivable, similarly, would reduce operating cash
flow. The buildup in receivables could signal either of two types of underly-
ing problems. On the one hand, management may be trying to prop up sales
by liberalizing credit terms to its existing customers. Specifically, the com-
pany may be carrying financially strained businesses by giving them more
timetopay.Ifso,averageaccountsreceivablewillbehigherthaninthepast.

Tobesure,managementmayattempttomaskproblemsrelatedtoinven-
tory or receivables by pumping up the third component of working capital
requirements, accounts payable. If the company takes longer to pay its own
bills, the resulting rise in payables may offset the increase on the asset side.
Fortunately for analysts, companies think twice before playing this card,
because of potential repercussions on operations. Suppliers might view a
slowdown in payments as a sign of financial weakness. Vital trade credit
could dry up as a consequence.
In any case, analysts should use operating cash flow as one of many
diagnostic tools. They should not rely on it exclusively, any more than they
should limit their surveillance solely to tracking EBITDA. If a company

resorts to stretching out its payables, other ratios detailed in Chapter 13
(receivables to sales and inventories to cost of goods sold) will neverthe-
less send out warning signals. Note, as well, that if the company does not
finance the bulge in inventories and receivables by extending its payables
or drawing down cash, it must add to its borrowings. Accordingly, a rising
debt-to-capital ratio (see Chapter 13) can confirm an adverse credit trend
revealed by operating cash flow.

of performance, because investors reward stability with high price-earnings
multiples. The trend of moving up the income statement reached its logical
conclusion during the technology stock boom of the late 1990s. Investors
latched onto the highest, most stable figure of all by valuing stocks on
price-sales ratios. (To obscure what was going on, some companies actually
resorted to discussing their earnings before expenses, or EBE.) As New
Economy companies that report little if any GAAP income have become
more prominent in the public equity market, multiples of sales have gained
considerable respectability among analysts.
One thing that has not changed is the principle that reducing com-
pany analysis to a single financial ratio such as EBITDA, although allur-
ing as a labor-saving device, is unwise. Once corporate managers find out
which ratio analysts are single-mindedly focused on, they will devote mas-
sive time and energy to gaming that metric. Considering a variety of ratios
may improve the analysis simply because companies’ efforts to dress up the
premier ratio will cause others to weaken, as when delayed write-offs of
stale inventory flatter earnings but bloat the ratio of inventory to cost of
goods sold.

CHAPTER 9
The Reliability of Disclosure
and Audits
A
naive observer might consider it overkill to scrutinize a company’s finan-
cialstatementsforsignsthatmanagementispresentinganythinglessthan
a candid picture. After all, extensive regulations compel publicly traded cor-
porations to disclose material events affecting the value of their securities.
Even if a company’s management is inclined to finagle, investors have a sec-
ond line of defense in the form of mandatory annual certification of the
financials by highly trained auditors. The Securities and Exchange Com-
mission’s (SEC) Corporation Finance and Enforcement divisions provide an
additional line of defense.
Theseargumentsaccuratelyportrayhowthesystemissupposedtowork
for the benefit of the users of financial statements. As in so many other situ-
ations, however, the gap between theory and practice is substantial when it
comes to relying on legal mechanisms to protect shareholders and lenders.
Up to a point, it is true, fear of the consequences of breaking the law keeps
corporatemanagersinline. Bendingthelawisanothermatter,though,inthe
minds of many executives. If their bonuses depend on presenting results in
an unfairly favorable light, they can usually see their way clear to adopting
that course.
Getting the job done, in the corporate world’s success-manual jargon,
mostdefinitelyincludeshard-nosednegotiatingwithauditorsoverthelimits
to which the accounting standards may be stretched. Technically, the board
of directors appoints the auditing firm, but management is the point of con-
tact in hashing out the details of presenting financial events for external
consumption.Atensionnecessarilyexistsbetweenstandardsofprofessional
excellence (which, it must be acknowledged, matter a great deal to most
accountants) and fear of the consequences of losing a client.
At some point, resigning the account becomes a moral imperative,
but in the real world, accounting firms must be pushed rather far to reach

white lines drawn in college accounting courses and the fuzzy boundaries

At the extreme, executives may falsify their results. Fraud is an unambigu-

it. Cost considerations preclude reviewing every transaction or examining
every bin to see whether it actually contains the inventory attributed to it.
Instead,auditorsrelyonsampling.Iftheyhappentoinspectthewrongitems,
falsified data will go undetected. Extremely clever scamsters may even suc-

a procedure designed to foil concealment of fraud.
When challenged on inconsistencies in their numbers, companies some-
times blame error, rather than any intention to mislead the users of financial
statements.Seasonedfollowersofthecorporatescenearelikelytobeskepti-
cal of such claims. They realize that companies are not always as forthcom-
ing as investors might reasonably expect. The following examples illustrate
that audit failure can indeed be real and costly to the unwary.
WHERE WAS THE CASH?
The stock of Wirecard AG, one of Germany’s showcase fintech companies,
was on a roll as 2019 began. The brokerage firm Bankhaus Metzler
added the payments processor to its list of Top 10 stock picks, saying the
companywaslikelytoscaleupitsbusinessfurtherandoutperformitspeers.
Wirecard was scheduled to appear at investor events hosted by financial
powerhouses Guggenheim Partners and Commerzbank. CEO Markus
Braun spoke encouragingly about Wirecard’s fourth-quarter 2018 earnings
at the DLD tech conference. By January 29, 2019, the company’s stock was
up by 26 percent since year-end, far outpacing the German DAX index’s
6 percent gain.
Suddenly, Wirecard’s fortunes took a turn for the worse. Its share
price plunged by 13 percent on January 30. Early that day, the drop was
attributed to margin weakness in the company’s 4Q 2018 earnings report,
but a more troubling development then emerged. The Financial Times
reported that a Singapore-based executive in charge of accounting for the

company’s Asia-Pacific region was suspected of facilitating a number of
suspicious transactions with forged and backdated contracts. Following
the standard script in such situations, Wirecard denied any wrongdoing,
charging that the FT story was not only false, inaccurate, misleading,
and defamatory, but that it lacked any substance and was completely
meaningless.
Germany’s financial regulator, BaFin, responded by banning short-
selling of Wirecard shares. Prosecutors in Munich, close to the company’s
headquarters in Aschheim, began investigating the Financial Times for
possible violation of securities trading rules. At that point, prosecutors said
there was no sign that Wirecard had engaged in improper accounting or
violated German laws.
Over the remainder of 2019, Wirecard shares fluctuated as theFinan-
cialTimes continued its investigative reporting of the company’s accounting
practices and Wirecard claimed that an external probe by a law firm deliv-
ered a clean bill of health. A company spokesperson dismissed the business
daily’s new revelations as nonsense on the grounds that all of Wirecard’s
numbers had been audited. Increasingly, though, the reliability of the audits
by Ernst & Young was coming into question. Finally, on October 21, 2019,
thecompany’smanagementandsupervisoryboardcommissionedKPMGto
perform an additional independent audit on its 2016 to 2018 results.
When KPMG delivered its report on April 28, 2020, Wirecard shares
plummetedmorethan26percentasthespecialauditleftkeyquestionsabout
the company’s accounting practices unanswered. KPMG stated that Wire-
card had not delivered all of the requested documents, or had taken several
months to deliver them. Furthermore, nearly all the submitted documents
wereelectroniccopiesandwerethereforeunverifiable.AccordingtoKPMG,
lackofcooperation fromthreethird-partyprocessorsofpayments forWire-
card customers made it impossible to validate any underlying transactions
for 2016–2018. Consequently, KPMG was unable to state one way or the
other whether the reported sales revenue existed or was correct.
Wirecard’s decline accelerated after that point. Its shares plunged by
37 percent on June 18, 2020, as Ernst & Young told the company that
so far no adequate audit evidence could be found for €1.9 billion of cash,
representing approximately one-quarter of Wirecard’s balance sheet. There
were indications that auditors had been deceived with spurious balance
confirmations. CEO Braun resigned the next day and on June 22 Wirecard
stated that the missing cash probably did not exist. Braun was arrested the
next day on suspicion of falsifying revenue. By June 30, Wirecard shares
had fallen to €5.73 from €94.56 a month earlier. In the interim the stock
had closed as low as €1.28, on June 26, one day after the company filed for
insolvency.

208 A CLOSER LOOK AT PROFITS
Familiar-Sounding Criticisms of the Wirecard Audit
As in previous accounting scandals, criticism rained down on the audit
process in the wake of Wirecard’s collapse. It turned out, according to
FinancialTimes reporting, that just a few weeks before the insolvency Ernst
& Young delivered a draft version of its official audit opinion. It reportedly
rejected whistleblowers’ allegations, as well as concerns raised in KPMG’s
special audit. Ernst & Young’s draft reportedly stated that Wirecard’s
financial statements, including the balance sheet showing €1.9 billion cash
that management later said was probably nonexistent, truly and fairly
portrayed the company’s net assets and financial position. According to the
Financial Times, the draft opinion went on to say that Ernst & Young had
found nothing problematic about the Asian business of TPA, Wirecard’s
third-party payment-transactions-acquiring business, which was shortly
thereafter exposed as a sham.
TheWallStreetJournal reportedin2020thatErnst&Younghadsigned
off on the company’s 2016–2018 financial statements despite having raised
questions about unorthodox arrangements whereby Wirecard’s cash was
held in bank accounts that it did not control. Ernst & Young rejected criti-
cismsofitsauditprocedures,sayingithadbeendupedalongwitheverybody

Wirecard’s perpetration of a massive fraud despite the scrutiny of a Big
Four auditor had an all too familiar ring. In 2003 came the revelation that
€3.9 billion of cash held in a bank account by an affiliate of the Italian
food company Parmalat was a fabrication supported by a forged document.
Deloitte, Parmalat’s primaryauditor since1999, subsequently agreed topay
$149 million to the company and $8.5 million to investors. PwC was fined

companies they audit. The corporate clients want audits completed swiftly
and inexpensively, enabling them to release their results and move on.
Failing to satisfy management’s desire for quick, no-hassle audits would be

consulting and tax services. Most of the time the numbers are honest, so
auditors tend to assume they will not be the unlucky guardians scorched by
the fraudulent exception. Attempts have been made since the early 2000s
to eliminate conflicts of interest in auditing, but with only limited success.2
How Outsiders Detected Improprieties
Considering the huge financial irregularities that escaped detection in yearly
audits of Wirecard, it would have been surprising if outside analysts relying
on the published statements had uncovered all of the hanky-panky. Only
by finding sources within the company were investigative journalists able to
obtainthefactsthatbroughtaboutthecompany’sdownfall.TheJanuary30,
2019,FinancialTimes article that set in motion Wirecard’s final decline was
basedonaninternalpresentationandotherdocumentstowhichitsreporters

through a whistleblower inside the company.
The remarkable thing is how long Wirecard was able tokeep a lid on its
misrepresentations.Forexample,morethanadecadebeforeitscollapse,the
company was fined by leading credit card companies for certain troubling
practices. In 2008, according to aWall Street Journalreport,
3 Mastercard
Inc. fined Wirecard £11 million for using the wrong merchant codes to
process gambling transactions. The following year, theWSJ reported that
Visa Inc. fined Wirecard’s banking unit for incurring chargebacks totaling
15 percent of the unit’s revenue in the quarter in question. (Visa consid-
ered anything greater than 1 percent of purchases a high rate.) Chargebacks
are transactions that are disputed by cardholders. Sources cited by theWall
Street Journalsaid many of the disputed charges involved fraudulent use of
credit cards on websites of Wirecard clients.
Information about the credit card company fines only came to light
throughWallStreetJournal reportingin2020.Twelveyearsearlier,however,
Wirecard’s stock plunged by 24 percent on a single day (June 27, 2008) in
response to rumors that the company was manipulating its balance sheet.
CEO Braun responded by saying the company would ask BaFin to investi-
gate possible manipulation of its stock by short sellers.

capitalization, overstating its profits, evading taxes, and laundering money.
Zatarra, headed by analyst Matthew Earl, noted that the most notorious
practitioner of round-tripping was Enron. (See Chapter 11.)
Wirecard bought E-Credit Plus Singapore in December 2009 for €12.8
million. In the two months preceding that transaction, Zatarra found,
E-Credit’s ownership changed hands three times. In late 2014, the entity
that by then had been renamed Wirecard Asia was sold back to its original
owner, Yoshio Tomiie. The sale price was officially €4.3 million, but €2.5
million of cash and cash equivalents, as well as €1.7 million of receivables
net of liabilities, went with the business. In effect, Wirecard returned the
company to its original owner for free.
While Zatarra ascertained these facts from public filings, doing so
required a considerable amount of digging. Tomiie had taken great pains
to hide his renewed ownership of E-Credit, burying it under three layers of
holding companies. Further doubts that the 2009 and 2014 transactions
were arms-length were raised by the fact, also uncovered by Zatarra, that
six months before Wirecard acquired E-Credit, Wirecard Asia Pacific’s
vice president, Robert Lock, became an officer of an E-Credit subsidiary.
Zatarra not unreasonably wondered whether Lock received any proceeds
of the 2009 purchase of E-Credit.
Forensic accounting on the massive scale undertaken by organizations
such as Zatarra is not feasible for most users of financial statements. Many
of them have long lists of companies to follow and are hard pressed just to
keep up with quarterly earnings reports and relevant corporate news. The

billionaire ranks.

“review, direction uncertain.” Moody’s had previously signaled a potential
rating change in October 2013 in reaction to a definitive merger agreement
between ARCP and Cole Real Estate Investments, raising questions about
how much debt ARCP would assume in the deal and how its credit metrics
wouldbeaffected.Inconjunctionwiththeratingconfirmation,Moody’ssaid
thatitexpectedtheREITwouldsuccessfullyintegrateitsrecentacquisitions,
aim for more prudent growth going forward, improve its credit metrics, and
maintain sufficient liquidity. Nothing but blue skies appeared to lie ahead
for ARCP.
Before the year was over, the REIT was engulfed in thunderstorms. On
October 29, 2014, ARCP announced that it had overstated adjusted funds
from operations (AFFO), a commonly used measure of REIT performance,
by $12 million in 2014’s first quarter and by about $10.9 million in the
second quarter. According to management, some amounts belonging to
non-controlling interests were wrongly included in AFFO.
ARPCaddedthatitsauditcommitteebelievedcertainfinancialreporting
errors “were intentionally made” and “intentionally not corrected.” In a
conference call, CEO David S. Kay said the company had determined that
the first-quarter overstatement was unintentional but that that the second-
quarter number derived from a calculation made “in order to conceal the
error from the first quarter.”
4 Kay blamed the problems on bad judgment
rather than bad people and eventually went so far as to portray the whole
thing as a positive event, as it made ARPC a better, sounder company.
Immediately after the revelations of financial reporting errors Standard
& Poor’s placed the REIT’s BBB– credit rating on watch for possible down-
grade to the speculative grade range. ARCP’s share price plunged by 19
percent on October 29. That loss was reduced from a 37 percent intraday
decline by management’s statement that the original error proceeded from
a change in accounting method and did not reflect an intention to inflate
earnings. Prices also fell by 2 percent to 14 percent on the shares of three
other companies overseen by ARCP founder Nicholas Schorsch.
ARCP asked for and received the resignations of its chief financial offi-
cer and chief accounting officer. The company’s auditor, Grant Thornton
LLC,declinedtocomment.Apersonfamiliarwiththematterstatedthatthe
Securities and Exchange Commission planned to initiate an inquiry into the
accounting irregularities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation subsequently
launched its own probe.
The company’s troubles did not end with the October 29, 2014, disclo-
sure of intentional misrepresentation of financial data. The stock dropped
by 8.5 percent on December 15 in reaction to the surprise resignations of
CEO David Kay and Chief Operating Officer Lisa Beeson, apparently at the
behestofthecompany’sindependentauditors.Upuntilthatpoint,Kay,who

had taken over as CEO from Schorsch only in September, had adamantly
insisted that he would remain in place. It was further disclosed that on
December 12 Schorsch had resigned as chairman. He had retained that
title following the earlier, long-planned handover of the CEO title to Kay.
Schorsch consequently walked away from a compensation package totaling
approximately $100 million.
On December 16 Moody’s downgraded ARCP to the speculative grade
rating of Ba1 and stated that the outlook remained negative. Standard &
Poor’s, for its part, cut the company’s corporate-credit level rating from
BBB– to BB. The rating agency highlighted the ongoing management’s lim-
ited experience in running a public company. By this time, ARCP’s share
price was down by 38 percent from its level just prior to the October 29
disclosures.
Barely a week later, on December 24, ARCP discontinued its quarterly
dividend until it could generate accurate third-quarter 2014 financials. The
company further stated that its reported results as far back as 2013 could
no longer be relied upon and that it had hired outside auditors and counsel
to investigate.

company restated earnings for several earlier periods. Investors breathed a

recover their losses through litigation. As it happened, there were clouds on
thehorizonwellbeforethestormcommencedonOctober19,2014.Heeding
similar, early signs of trouble could help scrutinizers of financial statements
steer clear of future debacles.
On June 3, 2014, Marcato Capital Management LP, holder of 2.4 per-
cent of the REIT’s common shares, announced that on the previous day it
sent a letter to ARCP’s lead independent director.5 Marcato’s letter focused
largelyonitsdispleasurewiththecompany’srecentissuanceofequityat$12
a share. Only a month earlier, Executive Chairman Schorsch had stated that
selling stock at that price, a bit below where ARCP shares were trading at
the time, would severely undervalue the company.
The most worrisome signs of looming trouble that Marcato’s letter
pointed out were two financial reporting errors. The first occurred in
ARCP’s May 20, 2014, 8-K filing. (This mandatory Securities and Exchange
Commission report addresses unscheduled material events or corporate
changes.) The filing presented pro forma financial statements for 2014’s
first quarter that used an inaccurate share count, necessitating a subsequent
amendment advising investors to disregard the previous filing. ARCP then
made a mistake in the prospectus for the abovementioned issuance. The
company stated that the fees associated with its recent purchase of a $1.5
billion real estate portfolio from the Red Lobster restaurant chain totaled
an improbably high $108 million. On May 29 ARCP filed an 8-K reducing
that figure by 90 percent to the correct amount, $10.8 million.
Marcato attributed these errors to disorder in the company’s financial
controls, brought about by a rapid succession of major transactions. These
included not only the aforementioned Red Lobster deal and equity issuance,
but three acquisitions and the sale of a multi-tenant retail portfolio. The
eventsofOctober2014,however,suggestedtherewasmoretothestorythan
too many deals in too short a period overwhelming the company’s financial
reporting system.
Indeed, ARCP’s 2014 experiences upholds the “cockroach theory.” The
name derives from the popular belief that seeing one of these pests means
many more are present. This bit of market wisdom holds that when a com-
pany discloses bad news on the financial reporting front, other, potentially
worse news is likely to follow.
On the eve of the October 29 bombshell ACRP’s share price was trail-
ing the Bloomberg REIT index, –3.7 percent to 20 percent, for the year,
yet the stock had barely reacted to the May 29 8-K disclosure of a finan-
cial reporting error. There was similarly little market response the following
day, when eyebrows were raised by FPL Associates’s analysis of ACRP’s
“outperformance”-based executive compensation plan. A senior managing
director at the consulting firm said the size of the compensation pool, which
stood to pay Schorsch as much as $94.1 million over the succeeding five

years, was the largest that FPL had observed in the REIT sector. The plan
had drawncriticismfromproxy advisory services InstitutionalShareholders
Services and Glass, Lewis & Co. (ACRP shares did fall by 5 percent the day
after the May 20 8-K filing.)
Consistent with the cockroach theory, investors could have avoided the
large losses that followed five months later if they had regarded May 2014’s
developments as signs of worse to come. The other lesson to be drawn from
the ACRP affair is that audits should not be considered definitive. Subse-
quent revisions can substantially affect securities valuations.

HOW MANIPULATION EVADES DETECTION
The gambits described elsewhere in this book are not just hypothetical
accounting tricks that the auditors have gotten wise to and protect investors
from in all instances. In fact, in the last few years the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s enforcement division has used novel data analytics
to extract penalty settlements from three public companies on charges of
EPS manipulation that went undetected by the auditors. As reported by
the Wall Street Journalin 2021,
6 the securities law violations that the SEC
personnel set out to uncover included making unsupported adjustments
to items such as stock-based compensation accounts and recording loss
contingencies in the wrong quarters. The three companies that came under
fire, Interface Inc., Fulton Financial Corp., and Healthcare Services Group
Inc., all settled without admitting or denying the charges and paid fines
ranging from $1.5 million to $6 million.
How could the SEC investigators find manipulation that the auditors
missed? Their method derived from 2009 research by Nadya Malenko, for-
merSECcommissionerJosephGrundfest,andYaoShen.

a result, they do not reach a materiality threshold used by auditors to

determine which quarterly adjustments to examine. The auditors focus on
higher-level reviews, testing companies’ internal controls and questioning
corporate officers on the rationales for large or unusual journal entries.
According to sources consulted by theWall Street Journal, more charges
of earnings manipulation may be generated by the SEC’s newly adopted
investigative technique.
SYSTEMATIC PROBLEMS IN AUDITING
Nosystemforauditingcompanies’bookswilleverworkperfectly.Updating
of accounting standards will inevitably lag business innovations that gen-
erate new types of transactions, giving companies leeway in how they are
to be reported. Indeed, companies devote vast energy specifically to finding
gray areas and loopholes in existing standards. Moreover, even crystal-clear
accounting rules cannot fully protect the users of financial statements from
corporate executives who violate them. Regrettably, the most respected
auditing firms are bound to have a few bad apples (i.e., individuals willing
to accept bribes to facilitate management’s misrepresentations rather than
faithfully fulfill their role as protectors of financial statement users). As with
other types of crime, it is not feasible for the government to devote enough
resources to law enforcement to deter would-be perpetrators through near
certainty of getting caught.
Acknowledgingthatnoperfectsystemcanbedesigned,however,isquite
differentfromsayingthatexistingprovisionsforissuingfinancialaccounting
standards, conducting audits, and policing fraud are as good as real-world
conditions permit. The present system is not the product of objective anal-
ysis by panels of experts driven solely by a desire to provide accurate and
transparent financial statements to the public. On the contrary, the design
of the rule-making bodies and the rules they issue are outcomes of fierce
political struggles. Auditing firms are profit-maximizing businesses that face
unavoidable conflicts between upholding professional standards on the one
hand, and retaining clients and controlling costs on the other. Given these
facts,individualcasesofauditfailurecannotbeviewedasisolatedincidents.
A systematic component perpetuates financial misreporting, despite reforms
that periodically emerge in reaction to exceptionally shocking accounting
scandals.
The system’s response to the financial reporting megascandals of
2001–2002, involving prominent companies such as Enron, Global Cross-
ing, Tyco International, and WorldCom, illustrates the intractability of the
problem. Critics of the accounting profession highlighted the conflict of
interest that had grown over the years between the provision of audits and

the sale of consulting services to the same clients. Was an auditor likely to
stand firm in a dispute over accounting policy, they asked, if the company’s
management could dangle lucrative consulting contracts as an inducement
to back down?
Popular outrage over the post–Tech Wreck accounting scandals created
political momentum to eliminate the auditing-consulting conflict. AWall
Street Journal analysis of the companies constituting the Dow Jones
Industrial Average8 found, however, that two years after the Securities and
Exchange Commission began to crack down on the practice, 62 percent
of fees paid to auditors were for nonauditing services. Furthermore, the
decline from 75 percent in the preceding year (2001) was overstated. The
new rules on auditor independence expanded the definition of what could
be considered part of the audit fee. Services that were reclassified from
non-auditing to auditing included statutory audits, reviews of documents
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and consultations
on taxes and accounting to the extent they were needed to comply with
generally accepted auditing standards. To some extent as well, the relative
decline in the auditing-related portion of total fees reflected an average 10
percent to 15 percent year-over-year increase in the cost of audits, reflecting
the increased complexity of accounting standards and expanded use of
specialists to deal with derivatives contracts. According to Barbara Roper,
director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America,
“The conflict looks less without anything having changed.”
9
The response to the 2001–2002 accounting scandals illustrates the way
lobbyists for reporting companies and their auditors can block more thor-
oughgoing reforms. Advocates for the users of financial statements, such as
the Chartered Financial Analysts Institute, are outgunned by corporate and
auditing interests. Those groups commit substantial resources to participat-
inginhearingsandrequestsforcommentsthatinfluencethedeliberationsof
the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC. As the reform pro-
cess drags on, popular anger over accounting issues tends to subside, as the
public’sattentionshiftstonewcontroversiesinotherareasoflegislationand
regulation. With attention diverted from reform of the accounting system,
persistent lobbying by corporations and auditors waters down the original
sweeping proposals.
Systematic problems in the audit process arise not only from the regu-
latory structure but also from the business strategies of profit-maximizing
accounting firms.
10 The problem dates back to the 1970s, when the Ameri-
can Institute of Certified Public Accountants lifted a ban on auditors adver-
tising their services, soliciting rival firms’ clients unless invited, and partic-
ipating in competitive bids for business. This change resulted from a fed-
eralgovernment crackdown onsuchruleswithinprofessions,deemingthem

anticompetitive and threatening to launch antitrust suits to abolish them.
Bidding wars resulted, and over time, audits became a service that account-
ing firms offered at a knockdown rate to compete for the more profitable
consulting business. Increasingly, auditing was offered at a flat fee, making
it imperative to hold down costs. Under pressure to limit the hours devoted
to an audit, firms were not consistently able to devote the resources needed
to uncover improper reporting.
In the 1990s, risk-based audits emerged as a means of keeping a lid on
costs. Firms abandoned their traditional bottom-up approach of examining
all components of the financial statements. Instead of focusing on details of
individual transactions, they identified the areas that in their judgment pre-
sentedthegreatestriskoferrororfraud,suchascomplexderivatives.Incred-
ibly,thesejudgmentsinsomecaseswerebasedonmanagement’sadvice.For
instance, when Ernst & Young audited the 2002 accounts of HealthSouth
(see Chapter 11 for details of that company’s massive accounting fraud), the
audit team asked the company’s executives whether they were aware of any
significant instances of fraud, to which the executives naturally answered
no. The auditors accepted management’s assertion on the grounds that they
considered HealthSouth’s management ethical and its system for generating
financial data reliable. On that basis, the Ernst & Young audit team per-
formed many fewer tests of HealthSouth’s numbers than they would have at
a company they deemed to have a higher risk of improper accounting.
The detrimental impact of the shift toward risk-based audits was also
apparent in the accounting fraud of telecommunications giant WorldCom.
For a period during 2002, investors seriously wondered if any company’s
financial statements were reliable, considering what lay beneath the
WorldCom financials that, according to Arthur Andersen, were prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). All
told, WorldCom racked up $10.6 billion of fraudulent profits on the way
to becoming, in 2002, the largest corporate bankruptcy up to that time.
In WorldCom’s early days, Arthur Andersen audited the company in
a meticulous, bottom-up way. It reviewed thousands of individual transac-
tions and confirmed them in the company’s general ledger. As the company
grew, however, Andersen migrated toward a risk-based process. The audi-
tors used sophisticated software to analyze WorldCom’s statements and met
to brainstorm about ways in which management might be fudging the num-
bers.Oncetheyidentifiedanareaofhighrisk,theyassessedtheadequacy of
the internal controls by reviewing procedures with employees and running
sample tests to determine whether the procedures were being followed.
If a question arose about controls or procedures, Andersen relied
on the answers provided by management. This was problematic for
two reasons. First, Andersen’s software had identified WorldCom as a

maximum-risk client. Second, the relationship between Andersen and
WorldCom’s management was not conducive to asking tough questions
or being skeptical about the answers. In its proposal to the company for
the 2000 audit, Andersen characterized itself as “a committed member of
[WorldCom’s] team.”
11 Imagine a football referee calling himself a member
of a team in a game at which he was officiating!
Andersen’s auditors regularly asked WorldCom managers whether they
had made any unusual top-side adjustments (i.e., general ledger account-
ing entries that were recorded after the books had closed for the quarter).
The executives consistently replied that they had not, and according to a
reportbythecompany’sbankruptcyexaminer,Andersendidnoteststocon-
firm their claims. As a supposed safeguard, the auditors looked for large
swings in items on WorldCom’s consolidated balance sheet. Finding none,
they concluded that no follow-up procedures were needed. As it turned out,
however, management had manipulated the statements precisely to ensure
thattherewouldbenounusualvariances.WorldCom’stop-sideadjustments

in the old-fashioned way, they would have discovered hundreds of large

sticky note showing the number “$239,000,000.”

The Reliability of Disclosure and Audits 219
Congress’s unwillingness to give the SEC the resources it needed to do
its job reflected more than competing claims on the federal budget. From
an ideological standpoint, many members of Congress opposed strict con-
trols on business. One manifestation of this attitude was a 1995 proposal
for a five-year freeze on the SEC’s budget, a cutback in the number of com-
missioners from five to three, and a requirement that the agency justify the
cost of any regulatory change. Fortunately for users of financial statements,
these proposals were not accepted. In October 2000, SEC Chairman Arthur
Levitt and enforcement chief Richard Walker presented evidence of audi-
tors agreeing to turn a blind eye to accounting irregularities rather than
risk losing profitable consulting business. Levitt wanted to restrict firms’
ability to provide auditing and consulting to the same clients, but Senate
BankingCommitteeChairmanPhilGrammdenouncedtheplanas“toodra-
conian.”
13 The SEC had to settle for merely requiring companies to disclose
the amounts they paid auditors for consulting work.
Lynn Turner, former chief accountant at the SEC, said that the relent-
lessassaultfromCongressaffectedthecommission’sagendaandreforms.In
addition, Congress’s tight rein on the purse strings had an adverse effect at
the ground level of enforcement. Between 1991 and 2001, the cases opened
bytheEnforcementDivisiongrewby65percentwhilethestaffexpandedby
only 27 percent. According to former SEC official Richard Sauer, resources
were too stretched to leave time to prospect for new infractions. There was
already a backlog of items that clearly constituted violations. These con-
straints signaled to corporate management that there was a good chance
that cheating would go undetected.
As a demonstration of the impact of Congress’s frugality, in 1999, the
enforcement staff followed up on an investment newsletter tip regarding
financial misreporting at Tyco International. Responding to a request for
documents, Tyco submitted pages that blacked out entries related to Chair-
man Dennis Kozlowski’s borrowings under an employee loan program, say-
ing those items were irrelevant to the SEC’s request. It later turned out that
Kozlowskihadborrowedextensivelyforpersonalexpenses,eventhoughthe
program was intended to help executives cover taxes on stock grants. Fear-
ful that a wider probe would absorb too much of their limited resources,
SEC personnel did not question the blackouts or request the full company
ledger. They shut down their investigation with no action. New York State
prosecutors later charged Kozlowski with looting $600 million from Tyco.

CONCLUSION
Ifthehorrorstoriesrecountedinthischapterwereisolatedincidents,itmight
be valid to argue that in most cases, the combined impact of corporate dis-
closure requirements, external audits, and regulatory backup ensures a high
level of reliability in financial statements. Intense analysis of the statements
by the users would then seem superfluous. Many companies, however, are
either stingy with information or slippery about the way they present it.
Rather than laying down the law (or GAAP), auditors typically wind up
negotiating with management to arrive at a point where they can convince
themselves that the bare minimum requirements of good practice have been
satisfied.Takingaharderlinemaynotproducefullerdisclosureforinvestors
but merely mean sacrificing the auditing contract to another firm with a
more accommodating policy. Given the observed gap between theory and
practice in financial reporting, users of financial statements must provide
themselves with an additional layer of protection through tough scrutiny of
the numbers.

Inflating reported earnings in the context of M&A has a long history.

In a transaction that qualified for pooling treatment, the cost of paying a

associated with its frequent acquisitions.1 Accounting watchdog Abraham
J. Briloff calculated that in the case of the networking solutions company’s
acquisition of GeoTel Communications for $2 billion in Cisco stock, just
$41 million of that cost went onto Cisco’s balance sheet.
In 1997, four years before Briloff’s Cisco critique, theWall Street Jour-
nal reported that FASB was at long last considering restricting or abolishing
the use of pooling-of-interests.2 FASB spokesperson Deborah Harrington
explained that allowing the option of pooling treatment prevented investors
from comparing economically similar acquisitions that were accounted for
differently. The issuers of financial statement, true to form, overwhelmingly
preferredthemethodthatmadeitdifficulttocomparedealsbookedaspool-
ingstothoserecordedthrough purchase accounting.AccordingtoSecurities
Data Co, poolings had outnumbered purchase-accounting-method deals by
a ratio of ten to one over the preceding five years. Chief SEC accountant
Mike Sutton reported that over 40 percent of his staff’s time was absorbed
by tussles over which mergers qualified for pooling.
Not until 2001, four years after the news arrived that the account-
ing rule-maker was taking up the issue, did Financial Account Standard
No.141finallygointoeffect.Thenewstandardrequiredtheuseofpurchase
accounting for all mergers and acquisitions.
Investors should not have been lulled into thinking that reform put an
end to M&A accounting gimmickry. In 2003, theFinancial Times noted
an interesting pattern in industrial components maker Danaher’s financial
statements.
3 The prevailing rules enabled companies to write up the value
of goodwill created in an acquisition after fully evaluating the transaction.
FT contributor John Dizard found that following its frequent acquisitions,
Danaher wrote up the goodwill while at the same time writing down the
value of tangible assets such as inventories and receivables.
Danaher’s management declined to answer Dizard’s questions about
the rationales for deciding that the acquired companies’ tangible assets
were worth less than they had been carried at on the acquired companies’
books. He could therefore only hypothesize how this process could be
abused to fabricate earnings. As Dizard explained, a company could
game the accounting rules and bolster the earnings that support its stock
valuation by writing down supposedly unsalable inventories and allegedly
uncollectable receivables. Upward revaluation of goodwill would more
than offset those losses. Subsequently, the company could find that those
purportedly unsalable inventories were salable after all and, lo and behold,
the ostensibly uncollectable receivables were in fact collectable. The profits
resulting from the associated sales and collections would be greater than if
the assets had not been sharply written down in the post-acquisition phase.

Mergers-and-Acquisitions Accounting 223
FASB further refined theM&A accounting standards in2007 by replac-
ing purchase accounting with purchase acquisition accounting. Despite
continuing reforms in financial reporting standards, however, analysts still
need to keep their guard up when gauging the earnings impact of business
combinations.
In 2019 MarketWatch reported that the Securities and Exchange
Commission had stepped up its efforts to discourage acquisition-related
adjustments for deferred revenue that was written off under GAAP. Some
acquisitive companies were adding back this “ghost revenue” in calculating
adjusted revenue numbers commonly used by analysts. In June 2019, for
example, Ribbon Communications responded to an SEC comment letter
by agreed to drop its acquisition-related revenue adjustment from future
filings.
4
The two following case studies highlight financial signals that can help
investors dodge nasty M&A-related shocks.
GOODWILL GOES BAD
“When one door closes, another one opens,” said Alexander Graham Bell.
Acquisition-happy companies did not fail to see the door that FASB opened
for would-be abusers of financial reporting rules at the same time that
it closed the door on pooling-of-interests accounting. At that point, the
accounting rule-maker also ended the requirement for annual amortization
of goodwill. Since then, public companies have been required only to
examine their goodwill at least once a year and take a write-down if they
find that its value has been impaired. That change removed some of the
pre-2001 purchase accounting method’s disincentive to paying an excessive
premium over an acquired company’s net value. Under the old standard,
the more goodwill that was created in an acquisition, the greater was
the annual hit to earnings from mandatory goodwill amortization. Now,
companies could buy earnings through acquisitions at rich prices with
relative impunity.
5
Not total impunity, mind you. In 2015, General Electric paid
$10.1 billion for the French company Alstom’s energy businesses. Those
operations had a book value of –$7.2 billion. GE booked the differ-
ence between the two figures as goodwill, justifying the price it paid by
synergies that it could achieve by such means as cross-selling comple-
mentary product lines to generate incremental revenues. The resulting,
greater-than-100-percent ratio of goodwill to acquisition price was a
rarity. That ratio averaged just 65 percent in the preceding five years’
industrial-sector acquisitions.

224 A CLOSER LOOK AT PROFITS
On October 1, 2018, GE announced that it would write off
$23 billion from the value of its power equipment business. The charge was
mostly related to the ill-fated acquisition of the Alstom energy businesses.
On the following day, GE fired its CEO after just 14 months in that position
and Standard & Poor’s downgraded the company’s credit rating from A to
BBB+. The company’s disclosure that it would miss its 2018 earnings and
cashflow goals was a contributing factor in both of those developments.
GE’s stock actually rose on October 1, reflecting investor enthusiasm
for the executive chosen as the company’s new CEO, Larry Culp. As Jack
Cieselski ofAnalyst’s Accounting Observernoted, the power business’ trou-
bles were well known by then and were already incorporated in the share
price. The outgoing CEO, John Flannery, had acknowledged in 2017 that
if he had it to do over again, he would pay a substantially lower price for
the Alstom Assets. Between the November 2, 2015, close of the Alstom deal
and the October 1, 2018, write-down of the former Alstom businesses and
other power division assets, GE’s stock plunged by 36 percent while the
S&P500climbedby39percent.Inshort,themarketimposedalargepenalty
on shareholders well before the company officially conceded that the good-
will it recorded in the Alstom deal was illusory.
DOUBLE TROUBLE
On November 20, 2012, Hewlett-Packard announced that it would take an
$8.8billionwrite-downontheUKsoftwarecompanyAutonomyCorp.that
it acquired on October 3, 2011. HP’s share place dropped by 12 percent on
the day of the announcement while the S&P 500 edged 0.7 percent higher.
The wide-ranging technology company stated that more than $5 billion of
the Autonomy write-down was related to financial reporting improprieties
that it discovered only after the acquisition closed. According to HP, the
fraudulent accounting went undetected by the leading auditing firms that
scrutinized Autonomy prior to the acquisition but came to light when a
whistleblower stepped forward.
Controversy arose immediately. Autonomy co-founder Mike Lynch
denied the claims of improper accounting. He blamed the loss of value on
post-acquisition mismanagement by Hewlett-Packard. The stock market’s
previous assessment of HP management lent some support to that notion.
In the five years preceding the Autonomy write-down, HP’s stock price
declined by 67 percent.
Some commentators were skeptical that with a balance sheet of just
$3.5 billion shortly before being acquired, Autonomy could have created as
much as $5 billion of false value through financial reporting improprieties.

They suggested that as in the GE-Alstom affair discussed earlier, the under-
lying problem was a too-high price paid in the acquisition.
Lynch hotly denied that Autonomy misrepresented any financial report-
ing data under his leadership. In a 2010 speech, however, he had recounted
that in the company’s startup phase he placed a sign reading “Authorized
Personnel Only” on an office door. Behind that door, he told visitors, were
500 engineers working on top-secret projects. In reality, it was a door to
a broom closet. Autonomy’s colorful CEO gave the company’s conference
rooms names drawn from James Bond movies and at one point filled the
office fish tank with pirhanas.7
Nine years after Hewlett-Packard’s $8.8 billion write-down, the issues
it raised were still not fully resolved. Autonomy’s former CFO was con-
victed of falsifying financial statements in 2018, but in October 2021 Lynch
was still awaiting a decision on a $5 billion lawsuit brought against him
by Hewlett-Packard, the largest-ever U.K. fraud trial. More important for
analysts than the apportionment of blame for the $23 billion write-down
are lessons that can be drawn from the debacle. By learning those lessons,
investors may avoid huge losses of value in future M&A transactions. Leav-
ing aside issues of quality of management, which require study of corporate
strategyandexecution,thelessonstoderivefromthiscasestudyfallintotwo
categories – financial reporting matters and valuation of acquisition targets.
Financial Reporting
Australian investor John Hempton labeled Autonomy’s financial reporting
“perverse” in light of the norms of its industry.8 He explained that software
companies ordinarily have very few receivables because they sell their prod-
ucts upfront and for cash. At the same time, they have obligations to service
their software for a long period after they sell it. Consequently, software
companies’ unearned income is typically a multiple of receivables. Auton-
omy’s balance sheet, on the other hand, showed large receivables. This was
theresultofbookingsizableincomeforwhichthecompanyhadnotreceived
cash, while booking no obligation for future services. Hempton emphasized
that these facts could all be ascertained by examining Autonomy’s balance
sheet.
Renowned short seller James Chanos stated that in early 2011, several
months before Autonomy’s acquisition, the software maker was his largest
European short position. Chanos’s firm, Kynikos Associates, criticized the
company’s financial reporting in a report of July 2009. The payment of an
unusually large premium for Autonomy was a factor in Chanos’s naming
of Hewlett-Packard as an “ultimate value trap” at the July 2012 Delivering
Alpha Conference sponsored by CNBC and Institutional Investor.9

226 A CLOSER LOOK AT PROFITS
An October 31, 2009, article in theDaily Telegraphmaintained that
the length of Autonomy’scash conversion cycle “should ring alarm bells
for investors.” One implication of this divergence from the industry norm
was that the company was generating growth through acquisitions rather
than organic growth. In July 2010 an analyst at KBC Peel Hunt cited con-
cerns about increased capitalization of research and development costs at
Autonomy.
10
In summary, outside analysts pointed out signs of potential financial
reporting chicanery at Autonomy well before HP signed on the dotted line
to buy the company. It was later reported that HP personnel studying the
potential acquisition heard talk of accounting irregularities and looked into
it.Intheend,though,thecompanyaccepteddocumentationfromAutonomy
that refuted the allegations.

Valuation
It was not solely with 20/20 hindsight that some financially astute individ-
uals judged the price paid by Hewlett-Packard to be excessive. Oracle CEO
LarryEllisonstatedthatinApril2011hiscompanyturneddownachanceto
acquire Autonomy. At amarket capitalizationat thetimeof $6billion, Ora-
cle’s M&A head and its president told Lynch that Autonomy was already
extremely overvalued. Six months later HP paid $11.7 billion.

the time as well, according to theNew York Times, board member Meg
Whitmancomplained tootherdirectorsabout thepricetagonAutonomy. 14
Shortly after the deal was struck, Whitman became HP’s CEO and in that
role defended the acquisition. Technology analyst Toni Sacconaghi of San-
ford C. Bernstein said that in the days following the acquisition announce-
ment he spoke to many of HP’s major shareholders and not one thought
the company should go ahead with the transaction.

metrics commonly used in valuing companies’ stocks.)
Analytical Takeaways
For analysts, the key question about Hewlett-Packard’s ill-fated Autonomy
acquisition is not how the blame of the $8.8 billion Autonomy write-down
should be allocated among financial reporting improprieties, an excessive
acquisitionprice,andpost-acquisitionmisstepsbyHPmanagement.Instead,
the point is to identify signs of potential trouble in future M&A deals that

can be identified in advance from financial data available to outsiders. The
financial reporting red flags spied by critics of Autonomy and of its acqui-
sition by HP included Autonomy’s unfavorable comparisons with peers on
the level of receivables and the length of the cash conversion cycle. Similarly
pointing to trouble were valuation metrics that were out of line with those
of comparable companies.
CONCLUSION
A consistent theme through financial history has been corporations’ efforts
to boost reported earnings and therefore their stock prices by exploiting
weaknesses in accounting standards for business combinations. Over time,
reforms of those standards have shifted the specific tactics employed by
issuers of financial statements. The rule changes have not, however, com-

M&A-based value creation comes to light. Analysts should study each new
blowup to determine whether earlier financial statements contained clues
that troublewasbrewing. That process willenable them todevelop acheck-
list to aid in spotting potential for massive value destruction in the future.

good opportunities continue to appear in other countries.
Furthermore, financial reporting fraud has not completely disappeared

companies that intentionally misrepresented their results have successfully
shielded themselves from Sarbox-based prosecution via subcertification of
the statements they signed.
In 2016, though, theFinancial Timesreported that the U.S. Securities

reporting practices.
1 As reporter David J. Lynch detailed, the energy
industry was a particular focus of the SEC’s increased scrutiny in the wake
of a 75 percent plunge in oil prices over the preceding two years. One
investigation led to a settlement of accounting fraud charges with Miller
Energy Resources’ former chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and
external accountant. The three had valued certain Alaskan oil wells at $480
million, more than 100 times the price the company paid to acquire them.

yearsfromappearingbeforetheSEC.TheMillerEnergyaffairwaslessspec-
tacularthanthepre-Sarboxfraudsdetailedinthischapter,buttheoldercases
remain instructive on techniques for finding clues that something is amiss in
companies’ financial reporting.
Thefollowingdiscussionofoutrightfraudbeginswith“TelltaleSignsof
Manipulation,” the findings of systematic studies of financial statements of
companies that misrepresented their results. Four case studies of fraudulent
reporting follow, involving Enron, HealthSouth, Parmalat, and Luckin Cof-
fee. These studies explain how the frauds were perpetrated and also explore
the extent to which analysts did or did not succeed in detecting the wrong-
doing before investors suffered massive losses.
TELLTALE SIGNS OF MANIPULATION
The aggressive accounting practices detailed in the preceding chapters may
not win awards for candor, but neither will most of them land corporate
managers in prison. There are many ways for companies to pull the wool
over investors’ eyes without fear of legal retribution. Sometimes, however,
corporate executives step over the line into illegality.
Outright misrepresentation falls into a category entirely separate from
the mere exploitation of financial reporting loopholes. Moreover, the grav-
ity of such misconduct is not solely a matter of temporal law. In 1992, the
Roman Catholic Church officially classified fraudulent accounting as a sin.
A catechism unveiled in that year listed cooking the books in a series of
so-called new transgressions, that is, offenses not known in 1566, the time
of the last previous overhaul of church teachings.
Neither fear of prosecution nor concern for spiritual well-being, how-
ever, entirely deters dishonest presenters of financial information. Audits,
even when conducted in good faith, sometimes fail to uncover dangerous
fictions. Financial analysts must therefore strive to protect themselves from
the consequences of fraud.
No method is guaranteed to uncover malfeasance in financial reporting,
but neither are analysts obliged to accept an auditor’s clean opinion as final.
Even without the resources that are available to a major accounting firm, it
is feasible to find valuable clues about the integrity of financial statements.
Messod Daniel Beneish, professor of accounting and information
systems at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University, has devel-
oped a model for identifying companies that are likely to manipulate their
earnings, based on numbers reported in their financial statements.
2 (Beneish
defines manipulation to include both actual fraud and the management of

earnings or disclosure within generally accepted accounting practices
[GAAP]. In either case, his definition specifies that the company subse-
quently must have been required to restate results, write off assets, or
change its accounting estimates or policies at the behest of its auditors,
an internal investigation, or a Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC]
probe.) Beneish finds, by statistical analysis, that the presence of any of the
following five factors increases the probability of earnings manipulation:
1. Increasing days’ sales in receivables.
2. Deteriorating gross margins.
3. Decreasing rates of depreciation.
4. Decreasingassetquality(definedasanincreaseintheratioofnoncurrent
assets other than property, plant, and equipment to total assets).
5. Growing sales.
Note that Beneish does not characterize these indicators as irrefutable
evidence of accounting malfeasance. Indeed, it would be disheartening if
every company registering high sales growth were shown to be achieving its
results artificially. Nevertheless, Beneish’s data suggest a strong association
between the phenomena he lists and earnings manipulation.
Evidence of financial reporting manipulation can also be found outside
the financial statements. A paper published by the Rock Center for Corpo-
rateGovernance
3 focusesontheconferencecallsthatcorporateseniorexec-
utives make in connection with quarterly earnings releases. Professor David
F. Larcker and doctoral candidate Anastasia A. Zakolyukina of the Stan-
fordGraduateSchoolofBusinessidentifiedverbalcuesoffinancialreporting
hanky-panky by analyzing the question-and-answer sections of the tran-
scripts of 29,663 conference calls.
Basedonwhichcompaniessubsequentlyrestatedtheirresults,aswellas
a set of criteria for identifying especially serious accounting problems, Lar-
cker and Zakolyukina label each Q&A section “truthful” or “deceptive.”
Their methodology produces significantly better than random results, clas-
sifying 50 percent to 65 percent of the Q&A sections correctly. They also
find that judgments based on the words used by chief executive officers and
chieffinancialofficersaremoreaccuratethanamodelbasedondiscretionary
accruals.
Relative to the answers given by truthful executives, the replies of
deceptive executives contain more references to general knowledge (such as
the phrase “you know”), fewer nonextreme positive emotions (“solid” or
“respectable”), and fewer references to shareholder value and value cre-
ation. Furthermore, deceptive CEOs make fewer references to themselves
and more to impersonal third parties, saying “the team” or “the company,”

rather than “I.” They use more extreme positive emotions (“fantastic,”
for example) and fewer extreme negative emotions, as well as fewer words
conveying anxiety.
Another systematic approach to detecting fraudulent reporting derives
from a Sarbanes-Oxley provision requiring public companies’ auditors
to report on and attest to management’s assessment of internal controls
on financial reporting. A 2017 study by accounting professors Dain C.
Donelson, Matthew S. Ege, and John M. McInnis 4 compared auditor
reports on this matter during 2004–2007 with SEC reports of financial
fraud and Justice Department Enforcement actions of 2005–2010. It turned
out that auditors had found material weaknesses in financial reporting
controls at 30 percent of companies that later faced legal actions in which
fraud was revealed. In view of Donelson et al.’s findings, it behooves
users of financial statements to watch for auditors’ citations of material
weaknesses in financial reporting controls as a sign that accounting fraud
may eventually come to light.
5
One additional tipoff of financial reporting fraud can be found out-
side the financial statements themselves, according to research by Paul
Calluzzo, Wei Wang, and Serena Wu of Queen’s University.6 They docu-
mentedastatisticaltendency ofcompanies withsuspectfinancial statements
torelocate their corporate headquarters so as to come under the jurisdiction
of regional SEC offices with histories of lesser intensity in scrutinizing local
firms. After relocating, companies that are motivated by scrutiny avoidance
exhibit higher scores on a model designed to predict the likelihood of
misstatement. They are also more likely than peer companies to restate their
earnings.
Inanotherexampleoftheintellectualfirepowerbeingtrainedondetect-
ing financial reporting fraud, some researchers are utilizing the 1938 finding
of a physicist and known as Benford’s Law.
7 It states that counterintuitively
to most people, lists of numbers contain many more low digits than high
digits. In 2014 Columbia University accounting professor Dan Amiram,
along with co-authors Zahn Bozanic of Ohio State University and Ethan
Rouen, a doctoral candidate at Columbia, demonstrated to the Securities
and Exchange Commission a method of applying Benford’s Law to public
companies’ financial statements. According to their analysis, the statements
of Enron (see “Enron: A Media Sensation”) displayed a clear variation from
the Benford-predistribution on digits.
8
The SEC’s interest in advanced methodologies for ferreting out finan-
cial reporting fraud was also evident in its 2012 adoption of a computer
program known as the “Accounting Quality Model.” Nicknamed “Robo-
Cop” by the media, the program searches for outliers and other red flags in
companies’ financial statements. The Accounting Quality Model underwent

extensive revision subsequent to its launch. David Woodcock, head of the
SEC’s financial reporting and audit task force, commented that while quan-
titativetoolswouldonlygetbetterovertime,developingviableenforcement
cases would always require human judgment.
9 With that in mind, let us see
how human ingenuity fared in detecting some of the most famous financial
reporting frauds.
FRAUDSTERS KNOW FEW LIMITS
Companies that cross the line from earnings management to outright fraud
sometimes go to great lengths to cover their tracks. This may include enlist-
ing the auditors to be coconspirators against, rather than protectors of, the
users of financial statements. The evidence of criminal misrepresentation
often appears obvious after the fact, yet not even the most skilled analysts
definitively identified some of the most famous frauds until the schemes
became unsustainable and the companies collapsed.
The following four case studies – Enron, HealthSouth, Parmalat, and
Luckin Coffee – are cautionary tales. What appears to be a run-of-the-mill
instance of aggressive reporting may prove to be something far more malev-
olent. It may turn out to be a case of no bona fide assets supporting the
claims of creditors and shareholders. In studying these notorious frauds,
readers should pay close attention not only to the suspicious financial state-
ment items but also to the behavior of senior managers as the validity of
their stated profits is challenged.
ENRON: A MEDIA SENSATION
In October 2000, Fortune published a list of the world’s most admired
companies, based on evaluations by executives and securities analysts.
The business magazine wrote about one of these elite corporations, “No
company illustrates the transformative power of innovation more dramati-

best-selling book, The Smartest Guys in the Room,by Bethany McLean
and Peter Elkind, which was adapted into a film directed by Alex Gibney.
Lucy Prebble’s satirical play,Enron, was a runaway hit in London, but the
New York production closed after just three weeks, adding the backers’
$3.6 million to the collateral damage from the company’s sorry history.11
More important from the standpoint of investors and lenders, Enron
raised the bar for financial statement analysts. The company did not merely
take liberties with accounting standards in ways that standard ratio analy-
sis would reveal. Instead, the secretive management kept many of the most
important sources of reported earnings off the balance sheet and did its best
to intimidate anyone who complained about inadequate disclosure. As a
result, some portfolio managers and analysts came to mistrust management
long before any serious misrepresentation came to light. Outsiders’ inability
to model the company’s earnings added to their discomfort. Restatements
announced in late 2001 covered annual reports beginning in 1997, but not

that the company’s financial statements were unreliable.
Company Background
Enron was the product of the 1979 acquisition of Houston Natural Gas
by InterNorth, the holding company for Northern Natural Gas, founded
in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1932. Shortly after the formation of HNG/
InterNorth, former HNG Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay became
CEO and renamed the company Enteron. After business cards and sta-
tionery were printed, management learned that the new name closely
resembled the Greek word for intestines, so Enron was substituted.
Lay took Enron far beyond its original activities: natural gas pipelines
and the generation and distribution of electricity and natural gas. He
developed a vast trading business dealing in diverse products that included
oil transportation, electric power, steel, paper, broadband, weather, and
wastewater,aswellasavarietyofcommodityfutures.In1999,thecompany
launched an Internet-based trading business, EnronOnline. President and
Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Skilling built this operation into America’s
leading gas and electricity wholesaler and succeeded Lay as CEO.
Enron rode high on the trend of energy deregulation. In 2000, revenues
more than doubled, earnings soared by 25 percent, and the company’s share
price rose by 89 percent. In 2001, however, everything began to unravel.
In August, Skilling suddenly stepped down as CEO, forcing Lay, who had
continued as chairman, to take back the reins. Lay commented, “I can hon-
estly say the company is in the strongest shape it’s ever been in.”

misrepresentation, and trouble was signaled again with the departure of
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow in October.
At the same time that he was a senior executive of Enron, Fastow had
been the managing member of LJM Cayman, a private investment partner-
ship that engaged in derivatives transactions ostensibly designed to man-
age Enron’s trading risk. Shareholders saw a conflict of interest in Fastow’s
dual role and worried about the vagueness of disclosure regarding LJM
and related partnerships. In response to this criticism, Enron terminated its
relationship with the partnerships. The associated write-down of a promis-
sory note produced a $1.2 billion decline in shareholders’ equity, which
Enron did not even mention in its earnings release for the quarter ending
September 30, 2001.
WhenCEOLaylateralludedtothewrite-downinaconferencecallwith
analysts, investors became alarmed about the lack of clarity regarding the
partnerships. They feared that Enron might have used them to hide losses
in its core trading business. Investors were not alone in their confusion. In
August, when asked about details of Fastow’s complex transactions, Lay
had replied that the questions were getting way over his head. Now, the two
individuals who did appear to understand the deals – Skilling and Fastow –
were gone from the company. Investor anxiety mounted as the Securities
and Exchange Commission launched an investigation into Enron’s financial
reporting.
Ominouslyaswell,thesupposedlyhighlyprofitablecompanywasfacing
a possible cash squeeze. Enron drew down a $3.3 billion bank line of credit
and faced the possibility that its debt would be downgraded to speculative
grade. Already, Enron’s bonds were trading at yields comparable to others
in that category. The company faced the problem that a fall to speculative
grade might compel it to issue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover
the $3.3 billion of loans it had guaranteed, driving down its share price
through dilution. Downgrading could also cripple Enron’s trading business
by inducing other traders to cease doing business with it.

egy for stock of the rival energy trader worth $9.80 per Enron share. A year
earlier, Enron had traded at $83. The transaction, which included a cash
infusion by Dynegy’s 27 percent owner, ChevronTexaco, hinged on Enron
avoiding a downgrade to speculative grade.
Enron’s case for remaining investment grade was not helped by a
$591 million downward restatement of earnings for the period 1997
through 2001. Most of the revision arose from including in earnings the
results of two special purpose partnerships formerly treated as independent
and of a subsidiary of the LJM partnership previously run by Fastow. The
remainder, $92 million, consisted of changes that Enron’s auditor, Arthur

Andersen, had recommended but backed down on, accepting the company’s
argument that the amounts involved were immaterial.
A spokesman for Arthur Andersen called it “an unfortunate situa-
tion.”13 This proved to be a massive understatement. The firm, one of the
nation’s five largest auditors, was forced out of the accounting business
after being convicted of obstruction of justice for shredding documents
related to the Enron audit.
Enron at long last conceded that it was overly indebted. Management
tried to restructure existing debt, arrange additional borrowings, obtain
equity infusions, and raisecash by selling overseas assets. On November 19,
2001, the company told investors that it had $9.15 billion in debt coming
due by the end of 2002 and only about $1.75 billion of cash and credit
lines available. This disclosure came in the 10-Q for the quarter ending
September 30, which was filed five days late – another classic warning sign
of financial reporting malfeasance.
On November 21, Fitch stated that its Enron rating of BBB–, the low-
est in the investment grade tier, depended on the Dynegy acquisition being
consummated. The rating agency warned that if the deal broke down, a
bankruptcy filing was highly possible. For the next few days, Standard &
Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch kept their ratings in the invest-
ment grade category as the company attempted to negotiate a restructuring
of its bank debt. On November 28, the talks broke down, and all three
agencies lowered Enron to speculative grade. Dynegy terminated its pro-
posed acquisition, and on December 2, Enron became, by a wide margin,
the biggest corporate bankruptcy ever, up to that time.
In congressional hearings on December 12, Arthur Andersen CEO
Joseph P. Berardino suggested that Enron might have violated securities
laws. Fastow pleaded guilty to wire and securities fraud. Lay and Skilling
were convicted of fraud and conspiracy, although Lay’s conviction was
rescinded when he died shortly before he was to begin his prison sentence.
How Enron Misled Investors
One key to Enron’s concealment of its true financial condition was simply a
lack of forthrightness. Many of Enron’s disclosures met the letter of the law,
but according to aWall Street Journalarticle, some top-flight professors of
accounting said they could not make heads or tails of Enron’s transactions
withFastoworthecompany’sreasonsforenteringintothem.Anotherarticle
in the same publication stated that most securities analysts readily conceded
that they did not know how Enron made money.
The company’s description of its business shed no light and instead
spread confusion. Enron derived more than 90 percent of its reported

revenue from trading, which it called “wholesale services.” It explained
that business as follows:
Enron builds wholesale businesses through the creation of networks
involving selective asset ownership, contractual access to third-party
assets, and market-making activities.
This statement, wrote Dan Ackman on Forbes.com, read “like some-
thing written in German, translated to Chinese and back to English by way
of Polish.”

Enron also misled investors by aggressively exploiting wiggle room in
the accounting rules. The company booked revenue from its energy-related
derivatives contracts on the basis of gross value, rather than net value, as
is the norm for other securities transactions. For instance, if a brokerage
firm trades 10,000 shares of a $50 stock for a customer, it books as revenue
either its commission or the spread between the bid and asked price, which
might total $500. Trading an energy contract with the same gross value of
$500,000 and a similarly small commission or spread, Enron booked rev-
enue of $500,000 – a thousand times what a brokerage firm would record.
This accounting treatment enabled Enron to double its reported revenue in
2000,leapfroggingcompanieswithfargreatereconomicimpacttocallitself
the “seventh largest company in America.”
Excessivelibertieswith mark-to-market accountingrulesconstitutedyet
one more element of Enron’s misrepresentation. Under GAAP, it was legit-
imate to include in current earnings the profits on energy-related contracts
and other derivatives that it expected to earn over future periods that could
beaslongas20years.Attheendofeachquarter,thecompanyestimatedthe
fair value of each open contract to buy or sell electricity or natural gas at a
stated price. A subsequent change in the value of a contract would be added
to or subtracted from earnings. The potential for abuse arose from the fact
that quoted market prices were available only for contracts extending out a
few years. No such independent basis for valuation existed for longer-dated
contracts. In such cases, Enron was allowed to generate its own valuations,
using undisclosed assumptions and pricing models.
Naturally, Enron Chief Accounting Officer Richard Causey assured
investors that the company’s valuation estimates were conservative. He
also maintained that the unrealized gains were not heavily concentrated in
long-term contracts, where uncertainty regarding valuation was greatest.
Analysts nevertheless worried about Enron’s disclosure that it booked
$747 million in unrealized gains in the second quarter of 2001. That figure
exceeded thecompany’sEBITDA of$609million.(Forcompetitorsthatdid
not disclose a comparable number, analysts made quarterly comparisons of
the changes in values of net assets from risk management activities.)

238 A CLOSER LOOK AT PROFITS
President Jeffrey Skilling went further than Causey in discouraging
skepticism about the veracity of Enron’s reported earnings, venturing into
outright intimidation. On a conference call dealing with Enron’s earnings,
analyst Richard Grubman complained that the company was unique in
refusing to include a balance sheet in its earnings release. Skilling replied,
“Well thank you very much, we appreciate that ... [obscene epithet].”15
Another hint regarding Enron’s deceptive methods emerged as the com-
pany was attempting tosave itself through a sale to Dynegy. Floyd Norris of
the New York Timesreported that on October 23, 2001, the day before the
company forced out Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Emerging Issues Task Force received
a rush question: A hypothetical “Big Energy Corporation” has a natural
gas pipeline subsidiary and an energy trading subsidiary. May the company
report profits earned in one subsidiary but not report losses incurred
at the other?
Just as Enron’s income statement concealed the nature of its reported
earnings,itsbalancesheetmisrepresentedtherealityofitsfinancialposition.
From the outset of Ken Lay’s transformation of a trading natural gas utility
into a trading powerhouse, massive amounts of debt had been required.
Off-balance-sheet entities kept debt off the company’s books, based on
accounting rules under which Enron could assert that it did not exert con-
trol. Experienced credit analysts ignored the accounting technicalities and
added back Enron’s proportionate share of the off-balance-sheet entities’
debt. Still, the off-balance-sheet vehicles, combined with nontransparent
disclosures, enabled the company to make itself look less debt-laden than
it really was. From heavy reliance on off-balance-sheet financing, it was
not a wholly surprising progression to Fastow’s lucrative and conflicted
partnerships.
Enron also disguised the magnitude of its debt burden by extensive
use of a derivatives trade called a “prepaid swap.” Unlike an ordinary
swap, this transaction required Enron’s counterparty to make its payments
upfront, while Enron’s payments were spread over a multiyear period. The
spokesman for one bank that engaged in a prepaid swap noted that the cash
flows replicated a floating-rate loan. Therefore, he said, the bank booked
the transaction as a loan. Enron, in contrast, treated it as a swap.
While Enron grossly misled investors by stretching the rules, a large

stock, it can record equity only when it receives cash. When Enron revised
its financial statements in October 2001, it blithely labeled this violation of
GAAP an accounting error.
AnotherviolationofGAAPimproperlyenabledEnrontokeepdebtofan
affiliateoffitsbalancesheet.IntestimonybeforeCongress,ArthurAndersen
CEO Berardino said that Enron failed to disclose to its auditor that it had
guaranteed half of a 3 percent investment by a financial institution in its
specialpurposeentity,ChewcoInvestments.UnderGAAP,thatarrangement
meant Enron failed to meet a test for avoiding consolidation of Chewco.
As the Enron scandal continued to generate headlines, reports emerged
of grossly fraudulent activities. Employees claimed that in 1998, manage-
ment took them to an empty trading floor and had them pretend to be
salespeople busily engaged in selling energy contracts, all to impress visiting
securities analysts. Equally crude was a scheme in which Enron reportedly
borrowed $500 million from a bank and bought Treasury bills. A few days
later, it sold the Treasury bills and repaid the bank, reporting the proceeds
from the meaningless transaction as operating cash flow.
Did Analysts Detect the Fraud?
ThehighprofileofEnron’scollapsespelledfameandfortuneforanyonewho
couldlegitimatelyclaimtohavespottedthefraudinadvance.Investorswere
sure to flock to anyone with a methodology deemed likely to uncover future
faked profits. The record indicates, however, that not even diligent scruti-
nizers of Enron’s financial statements recognized the depths of the fraud.
Management successfully concealed the worst of its misdeeds until most of
the investors’ money had been lost.
To be sure, the lack of transparency in Enron’s financial statements
attracted notice well before the debacle. On September 20, 2000, theWall
Street Journal raised concerns about the year-to-date near-doubling of
Enron’s share price to $84.875, some 60 times earnings. The article drew
attention to the major contribution of unrealized, noncash gains to the
reported earnings of Enron and other companies with large energy-trading
units. “There could be a quality-of-earnings issue,” said Michigan State
University accounting professor Tom Linsmeier. “There certainly might be
great volatility that could cause what now looks like a winning, locked-in
gain to not arise sometime in the future.”
16 The opacity of Enron’s fair
value assumptions was a major concern. “Ultimately they’re telling you
what they think the answer is, but they’re not telling you how they got
to that answer,” Business Valuation Services analyst Stephen Campbell
complained. “That is essentially saying ‘trust me.’”

240 A CLOSER LOOK AT PROFITS
The Wall Street Journal’s detailed discussion of the mark-to-market
accounting issue alerted short seller James Chanos of Kynikos Associates
to the potential downside in Enron’s stock. Renowned for his skill as a
dissector of financial statements, Chanos was modest about his discoveries
when he later discussed Enron’s fall. Up until the summer of 2001, Chanos
stated, he suspected nothing worse than a case of overstated earnings.
“That is all you could tell from [Enron’s] documents,” he said.
18 Chanos
thought that the stock price would decline but not that it would plunge to
pennies a share.
Others who pored over the financials achieved similar results. For
instance, in May 2001, Off Wall Street Consulting recommended a short
saleofEnron,thentradingaround$59.Theanalyticalfirmcitedtwofactors
identifiable from the financial statements, namely, the mark-to-market on
nontraded assets and related-party transactions with private partnerships.
When Enron fell to $26, a little below Off Wall Street Consulting’s $30
target price, the firm removed its sell recommendation. That proved astute
in the short run, as the stock rallied to $36 before entering its final death
spiral. If Off Wall Street had known the full scope of Enron’s deception,
however, it presumably would have set a target price well below $30.
InAugust2001,BNPParibasanalystDanielScottoissuedareporttitled
“All Stressed Up and No Place to Go,” which urged investors to sell Enron’s
stock and bonds no matter what. Ten months earlier, Scotto suspended his
ratingsonallcompaniesconductingbusinessinCalifornia,includingEnron.
That action, however, was based on his concern that the companies would
not be fully compensated by regulators for deferred energy accounts under
the state’s deregulation plan. In short, Scotto deserved credit for advising
investors to bail out before some of the biggest losses, but his warning came
long after the $90 peak of August 2000.
Another purported instance of advance detection of Enron’s misreport-
inginvolvedtheCayugaFund,managedwiththeassistanceofstudentsatthe
Cornell University Johnson Graduate School of Management. On Decem-
ber 1, 2000, a year and a day before the bankruptcy filing, the fund liqui-
dated its entire Enron position at $67.38. That enabled the fund to book a
return of 129 percent on shares it had purchased much more cheaply.
Feidhlim Boyle and Tyger Park, the students who advocated a
100 percent sale, noted that the Beneish financial model indicated a possi-
bility of earnings manipulation. In addition, the student-analysts observed
a lack of clarity in the earnings generated by the energy trading business.
Finally, they could not understand the footnotes in the annual report, and
their professor likewise found them obscure. Park recalled a remark by
master investor Warren Buffett that if you cannot understand the footnotes,
it is because management does not want you to.

The Cornell students did not detect Enron’s fraud, however. In fact,
theydownplayedtheimportanceoftheBeneishmodel’ssignal.Thestudents
recommended a sale based on the stock’s prevailing price but rated Enron
neutral over the long term, which they surely would not have done if they
suspected massive falsification.
McCullough Research did an excellent job of spotting inconsistencies
in Enron’s financials. Enron Online’s quarterly earnings report for the
nine months ending September 30, 2001, claimed $544 billion of notional
revenue (representing electricity and gas transmitted), yet its Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission filing for the same period showed only
$693 million of energy purchases and sales. McCullough also found a
discrepancy between reported earnings less dividends and additions to
retained earnings. Finally, the firm noted that Enron’s reported cash flow
included customer deposits in California that had to be repaid at a later
point. Net of that item, cash flow was negative. This was all solid financial
statement analysis, but the problems came to light only in the month before
Enron’s bankruptcy filing.
Finally, Egan-Jones Ratings Company gained widespread recognition
for being swifter to downgrade Enron’s bonds to speculative grade than
larger competitors such as Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. The BB rat-
ing to which Egan-Jones lowered the debt, however, connoted only about a
1 percent probability of default within one year. Moreover, the downgrade
occurred just 37 days before Enron filed for bankruptcy, although the com-
pany’s misrepresentations dated back to at least 1997. Egan-Jones deserved
credit for its analytical rigor, but like the others, it cannot truly claim that it
unearthed a fraud deep enough to destroy the company.
Lessons for Financial Analysts
Enron’s success in sustaining its fraud over a long period represents a cau-
tionary tale of the limitations of financial statement analysis. The auditors’
failure to curb flagrant abuses of GAAP posed a huge obstacle to analysts.
Ontopofthat,thecompanydiditsbesttomakeitsfinancialreportsunfath-
omable.“They’renotveryforthcomingabouthowtheymaketheirmoney,”
saidJohnOlson,whoheadedresearchatSanders,Morris&Harris.“Idon’t

In a case of this sort, the most diligent investigation of the numbers
may not turn up a smoking gun before the company collapses. Accordingly,
analysts should be especially wary when a strong likelihood of financial
manipulation,asindicatedbytoolssuchastheBeneishmodel,coincideswith
nontransparent financial reporting. There are many companies to invest in
without risking capital on those that fail the smell test.

in large measure to a generous Medicare reimbursement policy for physical
rehabilitation of an aging population keen on sports and exercise. Over two
decades, Scrushy built the Birmingham, Alabama, company into the largest
chain of its kind in the United States, with 1,500 rehabilitation hospitals.
In the process, Scrushy amassed immense wealth, becoming known as
the Donald Trump of Birmingham. He acquired seven corporate jets, which
he frequently piloted. Several philanthropies that benefited from Health-
South’sgenerositynamedbuildingsafterScrushy.Healsocapturedattention

Scrushy’s ascent proceeded without a hitch until 1997, when Congress

age patient’s stays from 21.5 to 17.5 days. Still, the company struggled to
meet Wall Street securities analysts’ lofty earnings estimates.
In the end, HealthSouth met the analysts’ expectations only by
stretching the truth. On March 19, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission charged that HealthSouth had overstated earnings by $1.4 billion
since 1999. Prosecutors later raised the figure to nearly $2.5 billion.
PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the new auditor chosen after the scandal broke,
eventuallyaddedtothistotal$500millioninincorrectaccountingforgood-
will and other acquisition-related items in the period 1994 through 1999,
plus $800 million to $1.6 billion in “aggressive accounting” from 1992
to March 2003. In 2005, HealthSouth restated its results for 2001–2002,
reducing revenue by about $1.5 billion and changing its originally reported
$481 million of earnings for the two years to $555 million of losses.
According to the SEC’s complaint, HealthSouth’s falsification began
shortly after the company went public in 1986. The securities regulator also
claimed that Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Scrushy had personally
profited from the fraud by selling at least 7.8 million of his own shares and
by receiving a $6.5 million bonus based on the false profits. Scrushy, who
was placed on leave following the SEC bombshell and fired soon thereafter,
had only recently returned to his CEO post after a six-month investigation
of insider trading allegations.

Regarding the new charges, his lawyers commented, “Mr. Scrushy was
shocked and surprised at the unexpected actions taken by the government
over the past two days.”20 Even after all five chief financial officers who
worked under Scrushy during the company’s history confessed to partici-
pating in the fraud, the defense team maintained that Scrushy was unaware
ofthefinancialstatementmanipulation.“I’mnotanaccountant,”thedefen-
dant stated in a later civil trial related to the allegations.
Flat denial by Scrushy, regardless of the evidence that emerged, was a

but when asked to repeat his declaration of innocence in a congressional

a Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement action pending against
him. A woman who worked as a personal shopper for Scrushy’s wife said
of the couple, “Their life was about as uninhibited by reality as one could
imagine.”21
In a monumental case of unfortunate timing, a book hailing Health-
South’s phenomenal success reached bookstores shortly before the SEC filed
itsallegations. The Story of HealthSouth,byJeffreyL.Rodengren,waspub-
lished by Write Stuff Syndicate, a firm specializing in corporate histories.
Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah and Tom Harkin of Iowa had contributed
an admiring foreword, unaware of the impending storm. (The two senators
also participated in Scrushy’s 1997 wedding, with Hatch writing a song for
the occasion.)
Methods of Misrepresentation
AccordingtoHealthSouthwhistleblowerWestonL.Smith,Scrushyregularly
convenedso-calledfamilymeetingsinwhichhedirectedcompanyexecutives
to inflate reported earnings to meet securities analysts’ estimates. The fake
accounting entries were called “dirt.”
22 Smith, who pleaded guilty to four
federal criminal charges, had been HealthSouth’s chief financial officer until
August 2002, before switching to head of inpatient operations. The com-
plaintstatedthatwhenHealthSouthofficialsandaccountantsurgedScrushy
to cease inflating profits, he replied, in effect, “Not until I sell my stock.”
23
Among the false filings Smith admitted to was a certification that finan-
cial statements sent to the SEC were true. Doing so was a violation of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, enacted in 2002 following massive financial reporting
frauds at Enron and WorldCom. The Sarbox provision requiring CFOs and
CEOs to attest to the accuracy of financial statements gave prosecutors a

powerful weapon to wield against falsifiers, but HealthSouth’s fraud dis-
pelled any notion that the tough new law would end financial misreporting
altogether.
HealthSouth exaggerated its earnings by understating the gap between
the cost of a treatment and the amount that the patient’s insurance would
cover. That enabled the company to set aside an unrealistically small
allowance for uncollectable accounts. Each time the company overstated
its net revenue and earnings in this way, it made a corresponding balance
sheet adjustment, raising the value of an asset such as property, plant,
and equipment. Another HealthSouth executive who pleaded guilty to
participating in accounting fraud said the company overbooked certain
reserve accounts referred to internally as “socks,” then later “bled them
out” into revenue.24
To avoid detection, HealthSouth made no large, concentrated adjust-
ments but instead spread them over several different categories, including
inventory, intangible assets, and property, plant, and equipment (PP&E).
Knowing that the auditors would question an addition to fixed assets only
if it was greater than a certain dollar amount, the company officials were
careful not to exceed that threshold.

HealthSouth also propped up profits by failing to write off receivables
with little chance of being collected. That classic dodge accounted for most
of the $500 million of questionable accounting uncovered by an internal
investigation, separate from PriceWaterhouseCoopers’ study of outright fal-
sification. In addition, the company did not recognize losses when it sold
assets that had declined in value. Also, in one instance, the financial state-

Securities holders paid a heavy price for HealthSouth’s financial hanky-
panky. Following the SEC’s initial accusation of financial reporting vio-
lations on March 19, 2003, HealthSouth lost access to a $1.25 billion
line of credit. With a $354 million convertible bond coming due in a
little over a week, it appeared doubtful that the company could arrange
a new loan to cover the debt maturity without first filing for bankruptcy.

(As post-bankruptcy lenders, the banks would get first claim on Health-
South’s assets.) According to Premila Peters of KDP Investment Advisors,
the company owed $3.5 billion in total, but based on its cash flow, its value
was only $2.4 billion.26
Shareholders and bondholders were initially trapped in their positions
because trading in the company’s securities was suspended on March 19.
(Bond market participants who misinterpreted the suspension made a few
tradesonMarch20,buttheSECnullifiedthosetransactions.)Whentrading
in the company debt resumed on March 21, the convertiblesubordinated
bonds closed at 20, down from as high as 98 earlier in the week. Health-
South’s senior bonds were down from the mid-80s to about 44. Additional
bad news for bondholders arrived as bankers blocked the company from
making theApril1principal repayment on theconvertible bonds. Asforthe
stock, trading resumed on an over-the-counter basis, and the shares ended
March at 8.5 cents, down from $3.91 before the trading halt.
The People versus Scrushy
By October 15, 2003, a total of 15 HealthSouth executives had pleaded
guilty to involvement in fraudulent reporting. Several had testified that
Scrushy knew about or directed the accounting fraud. “The dominoes are
falling, and they are falling fast,” said one person involved in the investi-
gation. “It’s an investigator’s dream.”
27 Former SEC attorney Christopher
Bebel added, “Scrushy’s prospects look bleak.”28
CompoundingScrushy’slegalproblems,federalprosecutorsdisclosedin
July 2003 that they had uncovered evidence of tax fraud, obstruction of jus-
tice, witness intimidation, money laundering, and public corruption. It also
emerged that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was looking into the sui-
cideofWilliamMasseyJr.,whomanagedanumbrellacompanyforScrushy’s
personal businesses. Two months before taking his own life, Massey made a
hasty business trip to the Bahamas. The FBI suspected Scrushy of setting up
offshore bank accounts as a tax dodge.
On November 4, 2003, federal prosecutors charged Richard Scrushy
with 85 charges related to a false accounting slammed, including conspir-
acy, securities fraud, mail and wire fraud, and money laundering. Perjury
and obstruction of justice were added the following year, when a revised
indictment consolidated the charges into a total of 58. The 2003 indictment
made Scrushy the first CEO accused of violating the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
because he had signed the financial statements. He pleaded not guilty to all
charges,claimingthatnotwithstandinghisreputationasamicromanager,he

was oblivious to the massive fraud. Even though several of the 15 Health-
South executives who pleaded guilty had implicated him, Scrushy’s attorney
brushed off the prosecutors’ evidence. “They don’t have much,” he said.
“Their primary case is weak.”29
In his seemingly uphill battle to beat the rap, Scrushy capitalized on the
confident prosecutors’ decision not to seek a change in venue from Birming-
ham, where he was admired as a local boy who made good. Scrushy pushed
this advantage by hosting a new television series on a Birmingham station.
He claimed that the purpose was not to present his own side of the case
against him, but he reserved the right to counter “blatantly wrong” state-
ments.
30 The program was taped at Word of Truth Productions, part of
the outreach ministry of a predominantly Black church that Scrushy joined
in 2003.
Both his membership in the congregation and the TV show raised spec-
ulation that he hoped to win sympathy from jurors in a city where African
Americansconstituted73percentofthepopulation.Scrushyplayedthereli-
gion card by becoming a nondenominational preacher and delivering guest
sermons at several local churches. A former business associate of Scrushy’s
commentedthathehadneverobservedanyBlackexecutivesatHealthSouth
and added, “The first time I heard religion and Richard Scrushy mentioned
in the same sentence was when I read about him going to Guiding Light
Church.”
31 According to other accounts, Scrushy was deeply involved in
Christianity as a youth but later drifted away. Scrushy remained steadfast in
the face of criticism: “I am innocent of the accusations against me,” he said,
“and have been blessed by the Lord in having the resources to confront my
accusers.”

with another locally telecast program,The Scrushy Trial with Nikki Preede.
This program aired on a station owned by Scrushy’s son-in-law, and its host
had done public relations work for Scrushy’s law firm. A former Scrushy
attorney was a frequent commentator on the show, and the station’s general
manager had played guitar and fiddle in Scrushy’s country-western band.
The judge felt obliged to instruct the jury not to watch any television pro-
grams dealing with Scrushy and HealthSouth.

of cracking jokes during long stretches of accounting-related testimony,

arguing that it may have caused some jurors to take the proceedings less
seriously than they ought.
In any event, on June 28, 2005, Richard Scrushy was acquitted of all
charges.“Itwasvenue,”saidformerfederalprosecutorGeorgeB.Newhouse
Jr.
33 He echoed a number of legal experts who asserted that the defendant
would have been convicted had prosecutors tried him anyplace other than
Birmingham.
Scrushy’s acquittal did not end his legal troubles, however. Four months
later, he was indicted on charges of bribing the former governor of Alabama
to appoint him to the state board responsible for approving hospital con-
struction. In addition, he faced a shareholder suit and SEC civil charges
arising from the accounting fraud. Scrushy eventually settled the SEC case
withoutadmittingguilt,agreeingtogiveup$77.5millioninstockgainsand
pay a $3.5 million penalty. The judge in the shareholder suit ordered him to
pay $2.8 billion. Finally, Scrushy was convicted of the bribery charge and
sentenced to 10 years and six months in prison. The judge rejected his plea
that if he were incarcerated, his good work as a minister would suffer.
Audit Failure at HealthSouth
The most dismaying aspect of the performance of HealthSouth’s auditor,
Ernst & Young, was its failure to challenge a sudden, large increase in cash.
The Justice Department claimed that the company’s reported $545 million
cash balancein 2002’s second quarter, a jump of more than 50 percent from
the preceding quarter, was overstated by more than $300 million. Lehman
Brothers accounting analyst Willens noted that auditors were supposed to
confirm cash balances by obtaining a sample. “It’s one of the easiest things
to audit and it does seem amazing,” said Willens. “But a sample may have
led them to conclude that everything was in order.”
34
Other red flags apparently were ignored. Michael Vines, a bookkeeper
wholeftHealthSouth’saccountingdepartmentinMarch2002,warnedErnst
& Young about accounting fraud, but the auditing firm concluded that the
company’s accounting was legitimate. Additionally, a HealthSouth internal
auditor told Ernst & Young that she could not get full access to the com-
pany’s books. The independent auditor took no action in response to that
disturbing statement, according to another partner.
In the view of experts in the field, internal checks and balances also
broke down at HealthSouth. The board’s audit committee met only once
during 2001, three times less than the minimum recommended by the SEC.
That should have alerted the company’s independent auditor that the
company’s internal controls were not adequately supervised and might be
unreliable. Such infrequent convening of the audit committee meant it was

“nonexistent, for all practical purposes,” according to Columbia University
accounting professor Itzhak Sharav.35
OtherreasonsexistedforquestioningwhetherHealthSouth’sboardwas
sufficiently independent to fulfill its watchdog responsibilities. “There has
been so much sleeping on the job at the HealthSouth board that it could
rise to gross negligence,” asserted Paul Lapides, head of the Corporate Gov-
ernance Center.36 Particularly troubling were directors’ transactions with
HealthSouth and Scrushy. One director earned $250,000 a year in consult-
ing fees from the company, and another received a $5.6 million contract
to install glass at a hospital constructed by HealthSouth. Another director
bought a $395,000 resort property in conjunction with Scrushy. Six direc-
torsandaseventh’swifewereparticipants(insomeinstancesthroughrelated
entities) in an online medical supply venture to which HealthSouth directed
more than $174 million in business. Moreover, for several years, a single
board committee oversaw both corporate audit and compensation. Corpo-
rate governance experts could find no parallel at another major company
for this arrangement, which was especially problematic considering that the
audit failure fattened Scrushy’s pay package.
Early Warning Signs
In 1999–2000, when Scrushy instituted an assembly-line-like process
to move patients through the system more swiftly, operating earnings
skyrocketed by 143 percent. Sales, however, inched up by just 3 percent.
Investigators later concluded that this implausibly large gap was a product
of fabricated profit numbers. Users of financial statements should be
skeptical of such wide disparities between changes in revenue and profit.
Negative surprises can also be a warning sign, as HealthSouth demon-
strated. The SEC complaint claimed that when Scrushy told investors on
August 27, 2002, that a change in Medicare reimbursements would cost the
company$175millionannually,hewasoverstatingthetrueimpactbyabout
$150million.AccordingtotheSEC,otherHealthSouthexecutiveswerewor-
ried that under the newly enacted Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the requirement to
certifythecompany’sfalsefinancialstatementsmeanttheymightfaceprison
sentences. The executives claimed that to lower security analysts’ expecta-
tions and thereby relieve the pressure to falsify, they persuaded Scrushy to
abandonthereportingfraudandgivesecuritiesanalystsabogusprofitwarn-
ing. In response, HealthSouth’s stock plunged 44 percent in a single day.
A large stock sale by Scrushy three months before that precipitous drop
aroused the SEC’s suspicions of insider trading. That trail ultimately led in
the unexpected direction of financial reporting fraud. For users of financial
statements, the lesson is that a management that appears untrustworthy on
other grounds may be tampering with the books as well.

MILK AND OTHER LIQUID ASSETS
Parmalat SpA’s rise to the rank of Italy’s largest food producer and the
world’s largest dairy company began in 1961, when Calisto Tanzi inher-
ited a ham and salami business. Two years later, Tanzi created the Parmalat
milk brand. He built it into an industry leader by importing technology for
packaging milk in distinctive rectangular cartons and preserving it for up
to six months without refrigeration. By 1970, the brand was internationally
known as the “milk of champions,” and the company started sponsoring
ski events. Tanzi expanded the product line to desserts, sauces, cookies,
and fruit juices and the corporate sponsorship to auto racing and soccer.
In the 1990s, Parmalat went public and launched a series of acquisitions in
Italy,theUnitedStates,LatinAmerica,andAsia.Thecompany’swell-known
brands included Archway cookies, Pomi pasta sauces, and Sunnydale Farms
milk. Along the way, Tanzi became a major contributor to political cam-
paigns and received a knighthood from the Italian state.
On December 19, 2003, Bank of America said documents indicating a
$4.7 billion balance in a Parmalat account were not authentic. Standard &
Poor’s promptly downgraded Parmalat’s debt to D, indicating default. Four
days later, holding company Parmalat Finanziaria SpA announced plans
to file for bankruptcy. As evidence of financial fraud emerged, Tanzi was
arrested. He estimated the hole in Parmalat’s balance sheet at $10 billion,
said he had been falsifying the financial statements for at least a decade, and
admitted that he had unlawfully shifted at least $640 million from Parmalat
to money-losing travel businesses controlled by his family. Tanzi ultimately
received a 10-year prison sentence.
As it turned out, the fraud extended beyond the phantom liquidity
on Parmalat’s balance sheet. A preliminary report issued in January
2004 revealed that the company had net debt of approximately $18
billion, almost $16 billion of which had not been disclosed previously.
PriceWaterhouseCoopers also found that the company’s revenues for the
nine months ended September 30, 2003, were only €4 billion, rather than
the reported €5.4 billion. Reported as €651 million, EBITDA was actually
just €121 million, according to the accounting firm, which was brought
in to investigate after the scandal broke. Parmalat’s market capitalization
prior to the scandal exceeded €2 billion, but according to a report by Enrico
Bondi, the special administrator appointed by the Italian government,
actual assets totaled less than €1 billion at the end of 2003. In a bizarre
touch, company executives attempted to destroy a computer used in the
fraud by smashing it with a hammer.

group rated the company’s stock a buy, highlighting its strong reported cash
flow, and Citibank put out an optimistic report in November. Furthermore,
thecompany’sdebtcarriedaninvestmentgraderatinguntilninedaysbefore
the bankruptcy filing. Earlier on, however, there were classic warning signs
that may indicate trouble even if a company outwardly appears successful.
A major red flag was Parmalat’s voracious appetite for debt, despite
claiming to have a huge cash balance. When challenged on this point, Chief
FinancialOfficerFaustoTonnaconsistentlyrepliedthatthecompanywason
the acquisition trail and that its liquid balances were earning good returns.
Union officials at the company’s main milk plant received a similar answer
and were threatened with a lawsuit if they made any public suggestion of
financialimproprieties.Inasimilarvein,CalistoTanzichargedthatfinancial
institutions,including Lehman Brothers,werespreading rumorsofaccount-
ing irregularities to drive down the price of its stock. This sort of response
is typical of companies engaged in financial fraud. One investment banker
who had declined to deal with Parmalat toldBusinessWeek that things had
“been strange” at the company since the mid-1980s. “It smelled bad,” he
confided.
37
Suspiciously high profitability constituted a danger sign to some
observers. A Milan banker noted that a very well-managed company in
Parmalat’s business would achieve an operating margin of 6 to 7 percent,
yet Parmalat was reporting 12 percent.
38 Lack of transparency in financial
reporting was another warning. “Parmalat was an ‘avoid’ recommenda-
tion,” said BarCap high yield bond analyst Robert Jones. “There simply
wasn’t enough information to form a fundamental credit view.”
39 Not
everybody steered clear, however. “Everyone who did their research knew
this wasn’t the cleanest company,” commented RBS consumer products
analyst Rob Orman, “but many people looked at the spread
40 and thought,
how far wrong can you go with a dairy company?”41
The2002financialstatementsofParmalat’sBrazilianunit,ParmalatPar-
ticipacoes do Brasil Ltda., included evidence that Parmalat was prettying
up its balance sheet through elaborate financial engineering. Deep in the
footnotes of the Brazilian subsidiary’s statements was a disclosure that on
January 18, 2002, the subsidiary issued a €500 million security convertible
into company shares. Unlike the owner of a standard convertible bond, for
whom conversion is optional, the buyer of this instrument “made an irre-
vocable commitment to convert” into shares at the 2008 maturity. Parmalat
Participacoes do Brasil Ltda. accounted for the transaction (in U.S. dollars)
as$523.8millionof“fundsforcapitalincrease,”partofanundifferentiated
$764 million balance sheet entry encompassing minority interest, funds for
capital increase, and shareholders’ equity.

Is Fraud Detectable? 251
When this item was consolidated at the parent level, it was simply
part of shareholders’ equity. Furthermore, analysts suspected that the
buyer of the convertible security was another Parmalat unit. On the same
day that the convertible was issued, Parmalat Finance Corp. BV issued
a €300 million bond. This would mean that by selling debt in one unit
and buying it in another, the company increased its shareholders’ equity.
Management declined to comment when the transaction subsequently came
to light, and unfortunately, the Brazilian subsidiary’s financial statement
was not a public document, so outsiders could not have used it to get wind
of Parmalat’s hanky-panky. Behind the scenes as well was the information
that Parmalat units engaged in currency hedges with related parties. The
economic impact of such a transaction does not truly constitute a hedge.
Additionalstrawsinthewindforattentiveinvestorsappearedinselected
brokerage firm research reports. In December 2002, Merrill Lynch analysts
Joanna Speed and Nic Sochovsky downgraded Parmalat to sell, saying that
the company’s frequent recourse to the bond market, while reporting high
cash balances, threw into question its cash-generating ability. The analysts
alsoprescientlyviewedParmalat’sexceptionallylargecashbalanceasanega-
tive.Theyappropriatelyarguedthatmaintainingvastamountsofdebtwhile
holding cash that generated a lower interest rate, rather than using the cash
to reduce debt, represented “inefficient balance sheet management.”
42 The
explanation for this uneconomic behavior turned out to be that the cash
wasfictitious.OnJanuary24,2003,ananalystatAuerbachGrayson&Co.
estimated that Parmalat’s net financial debt was $4.5 billion, rather than the
$2.3 billion reported by the company.43 Special administrator Bondi con-
tended that Parmalat’s true financial condition was easily determinable by
comparing its published debt totals with independently produced data on
the amount of bonds it had issued.
Another hazard signal emerged on February 26, 2003, when Parmalat
suddenlycanceleditsplantosell30-yearbonds.Potentialbuyersoftheissue
were voicing uneasiness about the company’s need to borrow at the same
time that it claimed to have $5.3 billion in cash. The company said it would
instead issue bonds with maturities of just seven years, suggesting the mar-
ket had less confidence in Parmalat’s long-run stability than management
had thought. This news triggered a fall in the company’s stock price to a
seven-year low. On February 28, Parmalat called off the seven-year issue.
In the last two months before the bankruptcy filing, the signs of trou-
ble multiplied. On November 6, Consob, the Italian stock market regulator,
requested details on how Parmalat had invested €3.5 billion and how it
planned to pay back bonds scheduled to mature by the end of 2004. On
November 11, auditor Deloitte & Touche disclosed that it was unable to
confirm that Parmalat had accounted correctly for a $135 million gain on

a currency-related derivatives contract. A classic danger sign, senior man-
agement turnover, surfaced on November 14 with the second resignation
within a year by a chief financial officer. Next, on November 27, the com-
pany announced that it had sold its stake in a hedge fund based in the
Cayman Islands for $589.9 million but on December 8 revealed that the
proceeds were not recoverable. By that time, it was clear that the company
was facing a liquidity squeeze. On December 9, Parmalat failed to pay a
€150 millionbond maturity. The company made the required principal pay-
ment on December 12, but by then, Standard & Poor’s had downgraded its
debt to speculative grade.
Oddly, the person who achieved the greatest renown for early recog-
nition of the Parmalat’s house of cards was not a financial analyst, but a
comedian. During a theater presentation in September 2002, more than
a year before the bankruptcy filing, the popular Italian entertainer Beppe
Grillo recounted to his audience that a Parmalat executive had told him
the company had €13 billion in debts and €13 billion in assets. Grillo, an
acerbic critic of Italian government and business practices, quipped about
Parmalat: “In a normal country, it would collapse, bankrupt.”
44 A video-
tape of Grillo’s one-man show was broadcast on Italian television after his
joke became reality.
Grillo claimed his anecdote was true but declined to name his infor-
mant. Later, though, he was called to testify in the judicial investigation of
the Parmalat scandal. Asked to explain how he had managed to foresee
the bankruptcy, he stated that anyone could have seen the holes in Par-
malat’s balance sheet, given that the financial reports were easily accessible.
Grillo had a bit of an advantage over the average citizen, however. Prior to
becoming a comedian, he earned a degree in accounting. He later founded
a political party that captured 25.5 percent of the popular vote in the 2013
Italian parliamentary election.
TROUBLE WAS BREWING AT LUCKIN
Luckin Coffee, a coffee shop operator based in Xiamen, China, commenced
operations in 2017. The company took aim at U.S.-based Starbucks,
the Chinese market’s dominant competitor, with technology designed to
reduce labor costs, deliver coffee swiftly, and undercut Starbucks’s prices.
Luckin’s bold plans attracted substantial financial backing from venture
capital firms, the state-run China International Capital Corp., Singapore’s
sovereign wealth fund, and investment giant BlackRock.
The company swiftly grew to more than 4,500 coffee shops, overtaking
Starbucks on that measure. Luckin went public in 2019, less than two years

after its founding. It followed up its $645 million initial public offering
(IPO) by raising $865 million in convertible bonds and additional stock in
January 2020.
Public market investors probably should have been concerned that
some of Luckin’s early investors cashed out their holdings in the IPO. On
March 31, 2020, the company disclosed that an internal investigation had
revealed that executives including its chief operating officer fabricated 2.2
billion ($310 million) of transactions from the second to fourth quarters of
2019. Luckin’s stock plunged by 75 percent on the news. Management said
that its 2019 financial statements could not be relied upon and that it was
also looking into its earlier financial disclosures.
OnMay11,facingpossibledelistingbytheNASDAQexchange,Luckin
fired Chief Executive Officer Jenny Qian and Chief Operating Officer Jian
Liu. Liu acknowledged that his management style might have been too
aggressive but denied that he had set out to deceive investors. Following a
six-week suspension, Luckin’s American depositary shares (ADRs) resumed
trading, only to continue their previous slide. On May 27, the shares closed
at $2.50, down from a peak of $50.02 on January 17.
Spotting Trouble before the Collapse
Luckin’s share price did not collapse completely without warning. On Jan-
uary31,2020,MuddyWaters,afirmspecializinginshortselling,announced
that it had shorted Luckin after receiving an anonymous 89-page report
alleging accounting irregularities and a broken business model at Luckin.
Muddy Waters called the report credible. The shares promptly dropped by
11 percent. On cue, Luckin categorically denied the allegations against it,
labeling the report’s methodology flawed, its evidence unsubstantiated, and
its interpretation of events malicious.
The unidentified author(s) of the report did not uncover evidence
of accounting irregularities solely by analyzing the Luckin’s financial
statements. Consider, for example, the claim that the daily number of items
sold per Luckin store was overstated by at least 69 percent in 3Q 2019
and by 88 percent in the 4Q 2019. According to the report, these estimates
derived from video surveillance and tabulation of traffic on 981 store
days at a representative sample of Luckin’s directly operated coffee shops.
Amassing this huge volume of data required the mobilization of 92 full-time
and 1,418 part-time staff. Clearly, only highly resourced organizations can
undertake this kind of research.
Scrutiny of financial statements did play a role in the report’s claim
that management overstated its 3Q 2019 advertising expenses by more than
150 percent. According to the author(s), the discrepancy was uncovered by

comparingthereportedexpenditureswithmediarevenuestrackedbyathird
party. The report speculated that Luckin inflated its advertising outlays in
order to recycle the amounts into overstatement of revenue and store-level
profit.
Subsequent investigative reporting by theWall Street Journal45 drew on
the proverbial “people familiar with” Luckin’s operations. Even before the
2019 IPO, according to the article, employees began generating fake trans-
actions, using individual accounts registered with cellphone numbers. The
business daily’s exposé also depended on obtaining internal documents.
AccordingtoreporterJingYang,assistedbycolleagueZhouWei,Luckin

Two lessons emerge from this incident. One is that nearly two decades
after Sarbanes-Oxley reduced (not eliminated) outright fraud in financial
reporting by U.S. companies, securities of certain other countries continued
toposemajorhazardstousersoffinancialstatements.Thesecondtakeaway
isthatinsomeinstances,evenameticulousexaminationoftheissuer’sfinan-
cialstatementswillnotbringthemalfeasancetolight.Insuchcases,exposing
the deceptive reporting depends on some combination of whistleblowers,
access to non-public documents, and large-scale surveillance efforts.
CONCLUSION
Each of these financial reporting episodes had a theatrical aspect. The
downfall of Enron’s management contained elements of tragedy that made
it adaptable to the stage. Richard Scrushy made a farce of the legal pro-
ceedings against him, while Beppe Grillo lent a comic twist to the Parmalat
case. The revelation of Luckin Coffee’s fraud unfolded like a whodunit.
Even though outright fraud is rarer in the United States than it was prior to
passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, analysts who learn the lessons of events
that foreshadowed the revelation of these frauds may become the heroes
of future financial reporting dramas. Note that the opportunities for such
heroism remain abundant in many non-U.S. jurisdictions.

CHAPTER 12
Forecasting Financial Statements
A
nalysis of a company’s current financial statements, as described in
Chapters 2 through 4, is enlightening, but not as enlightening as the
analysis of itsfuturefinancial statements. After all, it is future earnings and
dividends that determine the value of a company’s stock (see Chapter 14)
and the relative likelihood of future timely payments of debt service that
determinescreditquality(seeChapter13).Tobesure,investorsrelytosome
extent on the past as an indication of the future. Because already-reported
financials are available to everyone, however, studying them is unlikely to
provide any significant advantage over competing investors. To capture
fundamental value that is not already reflected in securities prices, the
analyst must act on the earnings and credit quality measures that will
appear on future statements.
Naturally, the analyst cannot know with certainty what a company’s
future financial statements will look like. Neither are financial projections
mere guesswork, however. The process is an extension of historical patterns
and relationships, based on assumptions about future economic conditions,
market behavior, and managerial actions.
Financial projections will correspond to actual future results only to the
extent that the assumptions prove accurate. Analysts should therefore ener-
getically gather information beyond the statements themselves. They must
constantly seek to improve the quality of their assumptions by expanding
their contacts among customers, suppliers, and competitors of the compa-
nies they analyze.
A TYPICAL ONE-YEAR PROJECTION
The following one-year projection works through the effects of the analyst’s
assumptions on all three basic financial statements. There is probably no
better way than following the numbers in this manner to appreciate the

interrelatedness of the income statement, the cash flow statement, and the
balance sheet.
Exhibit12.1displaysthecurrentfinancialstatementsofafictitiouscom-
pany,ColossalChemicalCorporation.Thehistoricalstatementsconstitutea
starting point for the projection by affirming the reasonableness of assump-
tions about future financial performance. We will assume throughout the
commentary on the Colossal Chemical projection that the analyst has stud-
ied the company’s results over not only the preceding year but also over the
past several years.
Projected Income Statement
The financial projection begins with an earnings forecast (Exhibit 12.2).
Two key figures from the projected income statement, net income and
depreciation, will later be incorporated into a projected statement of cash
flows. The cash flow statement, in turn, will supply data for constructing a
projected balance sheet. At each succeeding stage, the analyst will have to
make additional assumptions. The logical flow, however, begins with a fore-
cast of earnings, which will significantly shape the appearance of all three
statements.
Immediately following is a discussion of the assumptions underlying
each line in the income statement, presented in order from top (sales) to
bottom (net income).
Sales The projected $9,617 million for 2021 represents an assumed rise
of 4 percent over the actual figure for 2020 shown in Exhibit 12.1. Of
this increase, higher shipments and higher prices will each account for
2 percent.
To arrive at the projected 2021 sales, the analyst builds a forecast from
the ground up, using the historical segment data shown in Exhibit 12.3.
Sales projections for the company’s business – basic chemicals, plastics, and
industrial chemicals – can be developed with the help of such sources as
trade publications, trade associations, and firms that sell econometric fore-
casting models. Certain assumptions about economic growth (increase in
gross domestic product) in the coming year underlie all such forecasts. The
analystmustbecarefultoascertaintheGDPforecaster’sunderlyingassump-
tions and judge whether they seem realistic.
Iftheanalystisexpectedtoproduceanearningsprojectionthatisconsis-
tent with an in-house economic forecast, then it will be critical to establish
a historical relationship between key indicators and the shipments of the
company’s various business segments. For example, a particular segment’s
shipmentsmayhavehistoricallygrownat1.5timestherateofindustrialpro-
duction or have fluctuated in essentially direct proportion to housing starts.

Similarly, price increases should be linked to the expected inflation level.
Depending on the product, this will be represented by either the Consumer
Price Index or the Producer Price Index.
Basic industries such as chemicals, paper, and capital goods tend to
lend themselves best to the macroeconomic-based approach described here.
In rapidly growing technology sectors and hits-driven businesses such as
motion pictures and toys, the connection between sales and the general eco-
nomictrendwilltendtobelooser.Forecastinginsuchcircumstancesdepends
largely on developing contacts within the industry being studied. The objec-
tive is to make intelligent guesses about the probable success of a company’s
new products.
A history of sales by geographic area (Exhibit 12.4) provides another
input into the sales projection. An analyst can modify the figures derived
from industry segment forecasts to reflect expectations of unusually strong
orunusuallyweakeconomicperformanceinaparticularregionoftheglobe.
Likewise, a company may be experiencing an unusual problem in a certain
region, such as a dispute with a foreign government. The geographic sales
breakdown can furnish some insight into the magnitude of the expected
impact of such occurrences.
Cost of Goods Sold The $6,636 million cost-of-goods-sold figure in
Exhibit 12.2 represents 69 percent of projected sales. That corresponds
to a gross margin of 31 percent, unchanged from the previous year.

The projected gross margin for a company in turn reflects expectations
about changes in costs of labor and material. Also influencing the gross
margin forecast is the expected intensity of industry competition, which
affects a company’s ability to pass cost increases on to customers or to
retain cost decreases.
In a capital-intensive business such as basic chemicals, the projected
capacity utilization percentage (for both the company and the industry) is a
key variable. At full capacity, fixed costs are spread out over the largest pos-
sible volume, so unit costs are minimized. Furthermore, if demand exceeds
capacity so that all producers are running flat out, none will have an incen-
tivetoincreasevolumebycuttingprices.Whensuchconditionsprevail,cost
increases will be fully (or more than fully) passed on, and gross margins will
widen. That will be the result, at least, until new industry capacity is built,
bringing supply and demand back into balance. Conversely, if demand were
expected to fall rather than rise in 2021, leading to a decline in capacity
utilization, Exhibit 12.2’s projected gross margin would probably be lower
than in 2020, rather than higher. (For further discussion of the interaction
of fixed and variable costs, see Chapter 3.)

As with sales, the analyst can project cost of goods sold from the bot-
tom up, segment by segment. Since the segment information in Exhibit 12.3
shows only operating income, and not gross margin, the analyst must add
segment depreciation to operating income, then make assumptions about
the allocation of selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expense and
research and development (R&D) expense by segment. For example, oper-
ating income by segment for 2020 works out as shown in Exhibit 12.5, if
SG&A and R&D expenses are allocated in proportion to segment sales.

Forecasting Financial Statements 263
By compiling the requisite data for a period of several years, the
analyst can devise models for forecasting gross margin percentage on a
segment-by-segment basis.
Selling, General, and Administrative ExpenseTheforecastinExhibit12.2assumes
continuationofastablerelationshipinwhichSG&Aexpensehashistorically
approximated 15 percent of sales. The analyst would vary this percentage
for forecasting purposes if, for example, recent quarterly income statements
or comments by reliable industry sources indicated a trend to a higher or
lower level.
Depreciation Depreciation expense is essentially a function of the amount
of a company’s fixed assets and the average number of years over which it
writes them off. If, on average, all classes of the company’s property, plant,
andequipment(PP&E)aredepreciatedovertenyears,thenona straight-line
basis, the company will write off one-tenth (10.0 percent) each year. From
year to year, the base of depreciable assets will grow to the extent that addi-
tions to PP&E exceed depreciation charges.
Exhibit 12.2 forecasts depreciation expenses equivalent to 8.0 percent
of PP&E as of the preceding year-end, based on a stable ratio between the
two items over an extended period. Naturally, a projection should incor-
porate any foreseeable variances from historical patterns. For example, a
companymaylengthenorshortenitsaveragewrite-offperiod,eitherbecause
it becomes more liberal or more conservative in its accounting practices or
because such adjustments are warranted by changes in the rate of obsoles-
cence of equipment. Also, a company’s mix of assets may change. The aver-
age write-off period should gradually decline as comparatively short-lived
assets,suchasdata-processingequipment,increaseasapercentageofcapital
expenditures and as long-lived assets, such as bricks and mortar, decline.
Research and Development Along with advertising, R&D is an expense that is
typicallybudgetedonapercentage-of-salesbasis.TheR&Dpercentagemay
changeif,forexample,thecompanymakesasizableacquisitioninanindus-
try that is either significantly more, or significantly less, research-intensive
than its existing operations. In addition, changing incentives for research,
such as extended or reduced patent protection periods, may alter the per-
centage of sales a company believes it must spend on research to remain
competitive. Barring developments of this sort, however, the analyst can feel
fairlyconfidentinexpectingthatthecomingyear’sR&Dexpensewillrepre-
sentaboutthesamepercentageofsalesasitdidlastyear.Suchanassumption
(at 2.5 percent of sales) is built into Exhibit 12.2.

264 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
Operating Income The four projected expense lines are summed in
Exhibit 12.2 to derive total costs and expenses. The total of $9,049
million is subtracted from projected sales to calculate projected operating
income of $568 million.
Interest Expense Exhibit 12.6a displays information found in the notes to
financial statements that can be used to estimate the coming year’s inter-
est expense. (Not every annual report provides the amount of detail shown
here. Greater reliance on assumptions is required when the information is
sketchier.)
The key to the forecasting method employed in Exhibit 12.6b is to
estimate Colossal Chemical’s embedded cost of debt, that is, the weighted
average interest rate on the average outstanding amount of the company’s
existing long-term debt during the preceding year. The next step is to apply
the embedded cost of 3.77 percent to Colossal’s $4.728 billion projected
2021 average amount outstanding of long-term debt. This produces pro-
jected interest expense on long-term debt of $178.1 million.
To that figure, the forecaster must add $2.6 million of interest charges
related to the short-term debt (notes payable). These projections are based
onanaverageoftheyear-end2020andprojectedyear-end2021outstanding
balances, which comes to $171 million. The assumed average interest rate
is 1.50 percent, based on an in-house interest rate forecast.
Bear in mind that the method described here for projecting interest
expense involves a certain amount of simplification. Applied retroactively,
it will not necessarily produce the precise interest expense shown in the
historical financial statements. For one thing, paydowns of long-term debt
will not come uniformly at midyear, as implicitly assumed by the estimation
procedure for average amounts of long-term debt outstanding. Certainly,
analysts should recognize and adjust for major, foreseeable changes in
interest costs, such as refinancing of high-coupon bonds with cheaper
borrowings. By the same token, forecasters should not go overboard in
seeking precision on this particular item. For Colossal Chemical, projected
interest for 2021 comes to only 1.9 percent of sales, so a 10 percent error
in estimating the item will have little impact on the net earnings forecast.
Analysts should reserve their energy for projecting interest expense for
more highly leveraged companies. Their financial viability may depend on
the size of the interest expense nut they must cover each quarter.
Interest Income Exhibit 12.2 incorporates a forecast of interest income using
the year-end balance of cash and marketable securities. Based on expecta-
tions of an average money market rate of return of 1.0 percent on corporate
cash, the average balance of $203 billion will generate $2 million of interest
income.

268 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
Working Capital Changes (Excluding Cash and Borrowings) Details of the deriva-
tion of the –$10 million projection appear at the bottom of Exhibit 12.7.
Theforecastassumesthateachworkingcapitalitemremainsatthesameper-
centageofsalesshowninthehistoricalstatementsinExhibit12.1.Accounts
receivable, for example, at approximately 11 percent of sales, rise from
$1,017 million to $1,058 million, an increase of $41 million, as sales grow
from $9,247 million in 2020 to a projected $9,617 million in 2021.
Before assuming a constant-percentage relationship, the analyst must
verify that the most recent year’s ratios are representative of experience over
severalyears.Potentialfuturedeviationsfromhistoricalnormsmustlikewise
be considered. For example, a sharp drop in sales may produce involun-
tary inventory accumulation or a rise in accounts receivable as the company
attempts to stimulate its sales by offering easier credit terms.
Additions to Property , Plant, and EquipmentThe first and largest of the uses on
this cash flow projection is capital expenditures. A company may provide a
specific capital spending projection in its annual report and then, as the year
progresses, update its estimate in its quarterly statements or 10-Q reports
andinpressreleases.Evenifthecompanydoesnotpublishaspecificnumber,
its investor-relations officer will ordinarily respond to questions about the
range or at least the direction (up, down, or flat) for the coming year.
Dividends The $102 million figure shown assumes that Colossal will con-
tinue its stated policy of paying out in dividends approximately one-third
of its sustainable earnings (excluding extraordinary gains and losses). Typi-
cally, this sort of guideline is interpreted as an average payout over time, so
that the dividend rate does not fluctuate over a normal business cycle to the
same extent that earnings do. A company may even avoid cutting its divi-
dend through a year or more of losses, borrowing to maintain the payout
if necessary. This practice often invites criticism and may stir debate within
the board of directors, where the authority to declare dividends resides.
Until the board officially announces its decision, an analyst attempting
to project future dividends can make only an educated guess. In a difficult
earnings environment, moreover, a decision to maintain the dividend in one
quarterisnoassurancethattheboardwilldecidethesamewaythreemonths
later.
Paydown of Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt After including in the cash flow

This projection assumes that any net cash generated will be applied to
debt retirement. A net cash use, on the other hand, will be made up through
drawing down short-term bank lines. Underlying these assumptions about
the company’s actions are management’s stated objectives and some knowl-
edge of how faithfully management has stuck to its plans in the past.
Other assumptions might be more appropriate in other circumstances.
For example, a net provision or use of cash might be offset by a reduction
or increase in cash and marketable securities. A sizable net cash provision
might be presumed to be directed toward share repurchase, reducing share-
holders’ equity, if management has indicated a desire to buy in stock and is
authorized to do so by its board of directors. Instead of making up a large
cash shortfall with short-term debt, a company might instead fund the bor-
rowings as quickly as possible (add to its long-term debt). Alternatively, a
company may have a practice of financing any large cash need with a com-
binationoflong-termdebtandequity,usingtheproportionsofeachthatare
required to keep its ratio of debt to equity at a desired, constant level.
The allocation of debt reduction between notes payable and long-term
debt is based on the ending balances shown in the projected balance sheet
that follows.
Projected Balance Sheet
Withtheexceptionoftheallocationofdebtreductionbetweennotespayable
and long-term debt, constructing the projected balance sheet (Exhibit 12.8)
requires no additional assumptions beyond those made in projecting the
income statement and statement of cash flows. The analyst simply updates
thehistoricalbalancesheetinExhibit12.1onthebasisofinformationdrawn
from the other statements.

270 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
Most of the required information appears in the projected statement of
cash flows (Exhibit 12.7). Accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts
payable, for example, reflect the projected changes in working capital. This
projection maintains those items at the same percentages of sales as they
represented in 2020. Property, plant, and equipment rises from the prior
year’slevelof$895millionby$767millionofadditions,less$731millionof
depreciation. The projected cash flow statement also furnishes the increases
in deferred income taxes and the change in shareholders’ equity (net income
less dividends).
The ending balances of notes payable and long-term debt, as well as the
corresponding figures in the projected cash flow statement, are worked out
as a small puzzle. First, the $225 million current portion of long-term debt
in the 2020 balance sheet is replaced by the $197 million of debt coming
due with 12 months of December 31, 2021, as shown in Exhibit 12.6b.
Naturally, the $225 million of notes maturing in 2021 must be replaced
with new debt. Plodding through each step of paydowns and new issuance,
however, is an unnecessary time drain. The net of it all is that the debt in
the three categories shown on the liabilities side of the balance sheet must
sum to $12,165 million less accounts payable, deferred income taxes, and
shareholders’ equity. That comes to $4,942 million. The $197 million cur-
rent portion of long-term debt, already filled in, leaves $4,745 million to
be divided between notes payable and long-term debt. Allocate the amount
in the same proportions to each other as in the 2020 balance sheet and the
projectedbalancesheetiscomplete.Toderivethecorrespondingamountson
the projected cash flow statement, subtract the 2020 balance sheet amounts
from the projected 2021 amounts. Puzzle solved.
SENSITIVITY ANAL YSIS WITH PROJECTED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Preparing a set of projected financial statements provides a glimpse at
a company’s future financial condition, given certain assumptions. The
analyst can study the projected statements using the same techniques
discussed in Chapters 2 through 4 for the historical statements and also use
them to calculate the ratios employed in credit analysis (Chapter 13) and
equity analysis (Chapter 14). Based on the historical and projected data in
Exhibits 12.1 through 12.8, Colossal Chemical’s credit quality measures
will improve in 2021 (Exhibit 12.9). Total debt will decline, not only in
absolute terms but also as a percentage of total capital—from 46 percent to
44 percent. Similarly, cash provided as a percentage of total debt will rise
from20.0percentto21.6percent.Alternatively,asshownintheexhibit,the

underlying the projected statements that generated them. Logical though
theymayseem,theassumptionsrestheavilyonmacroeconomic forecasting,
which is far from an exact science, to put it charitably. Typically, the analyst
must modify the underlying economic assumptions, and therefore the
projections, several times during the year as business activity diverges from
forecasted levels.

investors and lenders will not base their decisions entirely on a single set of

analyst projects a sales increase over the preceding year of just 1 percent.
That is three percentage points below the rate assumed in the base case (the
most probable scenario) represented by Exhibit 12.2. The less optimistic
sales forecast implies a less robust economy than assumed in the base case.
For example, the analyst may assume no real growth and a 1 percent infla-
tion rate. In the revised scenario, the analyst assumes that Colossal will
manage to maintain the gross margins achieved in the preceding year. In
another instance, particularly a sales decline, that assumption might not be
justified,duetothefixedcomponentofcostofgoodssold.Keepingtheother
assumptions intact, the revised projections show smaller increases, relative
to the base case, in net income and shareholders’ equity. Cash provided by
operations is actually higher than in Exhibit 12.7 due to the smaller need to
addtoworkingcapitalexcluding cashandmarketablesecurities.Long-term
debt consequently declines more rapidly under the new assumptions.
Using Exhibit 12.10’s revised statements, the analyst can recalculate
Exhibit 12.9’s credit quality measures as shown in Exhibit 12.11. Under

274 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
the new, more pessimistic sales growth and gross margin assumptions,
projected cash provided by operations represent 21.2 percent of total debt.
The improvement over 2020 is indicated by the lower 20.0 percent ratio
projectedinthebasecase.Totaldebtasapercentageoftotalcapitaldeclines
modestlyunderthechangedassumptions,to44.1percentfrom45.8percent
in the base case. Although the addition to retained earnings (and hence
growth in shareholders’ equity) is smaller in the pessimistic case, so is the
need for new working capital to support increased sales. The borrowing
need is therefore reduced, offsetting the slower growth in equity.
To complete the analysis, an investor or lender will also want to project
financialstatementsonanoptimistic,orbest-case,scenario.Sampleassump-
tions for a three-scenario sensitivity analysis might be:
Assumed
Sales Growth
Assumed
Gross Margin
Optimistic case (best realistic scenario) 6% 33%
Base case (most likely scenario) 4% 31%
Pessimistic case (worst realistic scenario) 1% 31%

case,whereasthepessimisticcasereducesbasecasesalesbythreepercentage
points.Theanalystsimplybelievesthatthemostrangeofpossibleoutcomes
involves more downside than upside.
Other assumptions can be modified as well, recognizing the interac-
tion among the various accounts. Colossal Chemical may have considerable
room to cut its capital spending in the short run if it suffers a decline in cash
provided by operations. A projection that ignored this financial flexibility
could prove overly pessimistic. Conversely, the assumption that a company
will apply any surplus funds generated to debt reduction may produce an
unrealistic projected capital structure. Particularly in a multiyear projection
for a strong cash generator, the ratio of debt to capital may fall in the later
years to a level that the company would consider excessively conservative.
In such cases, it may be appropriate to alter the assumption from pure debt
retirementtomaintenanceofaspecifiedleverageratio.Surpluscashwillthus
be applied to stock repurchase to the extent that not doing so would cause
the debt component of capital to fall below a specified percentage.

In addition to creating a range of scenarios, sensitivity analysis can
also enable the analyst to gauge the relative impact of changing the various
assumptions in a projection. Contrast, for example, the impact of a
1 percent change in gross margins with the impact of a 1 percent change
in the tax rate on Colossal Chemical’s income statement. Exhibit 12.12
shows the effects of these two changes in assumptions on the projected
income statement in Exhibit 12.2, holding all other assumptions constant.
The sensitivity of net income to a 1 percent decrease in gross margin is $76
million ($307 million minus $231 million, all other things being equal.
A 1 percent change in the tax rate, on the other hand, affects net income
by just $4 million ($307 million minus $303 million), once again holding
everything else constant.
Thistypeofanalysisispopularamonginvestors.Theymay,forexample,
estimate the impact on a mining company’s earnings, and hence on its stock
price, of a 10-cent rise in the price of a pound of copper. Another appli-
cation is to identify which companies will respond most dramatically to
some expected economic development, such as a drop in interest rates. A
rate decline will have only a minor impact on a company for which interest
costs represent a small percentage of expenses. The impact will be greater

on a company with a large interest cost component and with much of its
debt at floating rates. (This assumes the return on the company’s assets is
not similarly rate sensitive.)
Appealing though itmaybe,sensitivityanalysisisatechnique thatmust
be used with caution. As suggested, it generally isolates a single assumption
and proceeds on the assumption that all other things remain equal. In the
real world, this is rarely the case. As previously noted, when sales fall, typi-
cally, so do gross margins. For one thing, cost per unit rises as fixed costs of
production get spread over a smaller number of units. In addition, declin-
ing capacity utilization throughout the industry puts downward pressure on
prices. Similarly, rising interest rates do not affect only interest expense and
interestincome.Higherratesdepressthelevelofinvestmentintheeconomy,
which can eventually depress the company’s sales.
PROJECTING FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY
Justasprojectedstatementscanrevealacompany’sprobablefuturefinancial
profile, they can also indicate the likely direction of its financial flexibility,
a concept discussed in Chapter 4. For example, the projected statement of
cash flows shows by how comfortable a margin the company will be able
to cover its dividend with internally generated funds. Likewise, the amount
by which debt is projected to rise determines the extent to which nondiscre-
tionary costs (in the form of interest charges) will increase in future income
statements.
There is one important aspect of financial flexibility, continuing com-
pliance with loan covenants, for which projections are indispensable. As
Exhibit 12.13 illustrates, debt covenants may require the borrower to main-
tain a specified level of financial strength. Compliance may be measured
either by absolute dollar amounts of certain items or by ratios.

issuer may be barred from paying further dividends or compelled to repay
a huge loan at a time when refinancing may be difficult. Curing the default
may necessitate unpleasant actions, such as a dilution of shareholders’ inter-
ests by the sale of new equity at a time when the stock price is depressed.
Alternatively, the borrower can request that its lenders waive their right to
accelerate payment of the debt. The lenders, however, are likely to demand
some quid pro quo along the lines of reducing management’s freedom to act
without consulting them.

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Another way that the analyst can look forward with financial statements is
toconstructproformastatementsthatreflectsignificantdevelopments,prior
to reflection of those developments in subsequent published statements. It is
unwisetobaseaninvestmentdecisiononhistoricalstatementsthatantedate
a major financial change such as a major (non-routine) stock repurchase,
write-off, acquisition, or divestment. By the same token, it can be impor-
tant to determine quickly whether news that flashes across the screen will
have a material effect on a company’s financial condition. For example,
willajust-announcedplantorepurchase5millionsharesmateriallyincrease
financial leverage? To answer the question, the analyst must adjust the lat-
est balance sheet available, reducing shareholders’ equity by the product of
5 million and an assumed purchase price per share, then reduce cash or
increase debt as the accounting offset.
Pro Forma Statements for Acquisitions
Pro forma statements are not limited to analysts’ rough-and-ready modi-
fications of previously released financial reports, generated in response to
corporateannouncements.Thecategoryalsoincludesdetailedincomestate-
ments and balance sheets that companies provide in connection with major
corporate transactions. These unaudited statements contain new disclosures
and are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on to notify
investors of material, unscheduled events. It is imperative to read them in
conjunction with the accompanying notes.

282 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
Among other pro forma income statement adjustments, CVS Health
reclassified insurance premiums from CVS Health’s SilverScript Insurance
Company Medicare Part D prescription plan and presented them separately
from net revenues from pharmacy, consumer products, and other. These
reclassifications were made to conform with Aetna’s insurance-related
presentation. CVS Health also adjusted the pro forma income statement for
forgone interest income associated with adjusting the amortized cost of
Aetna’s debt securities investment portfolio to fair value as of the merger’s
completion.
Inaddition,CVSHealth’sfirst-quarter2017earlyadoptionofAccount-
ing Standards Update 2017-07,ImprovingthePresentationofNetPeriodic
Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Costnecessitated the
restatementofcertainAetnaselling,general,andadministrationexpensesto
other expense (income) to conform to CVS Health’s accounting policy. Fur-
thermore, interest expense was increased to reflect expected debt issuance
to fund the Aetna deal and reduced interest income to reflect the use of
some of CVS Health’s balance sheet cash for the transaction. The interest
expense adjustment also took into account amortization of the estimated
fair value adjustment to Aetna debt that was to be assumed by CVS Health.
CVS Health quantified how sensitive its interest expense adjustments were
to an increase or decrease of interest rates from those assumed in the pro
forma income statement.
The pro forma income statement incorporated applicable statutory
income tax rates in effect on September 30, 2017, generally 39 percent.
CVS Health based its projection of combined basic and diluted earnings per
share from continuing operations on the combined weighted average basic
and diluted common shares of CVS Health and Aetna. Aetna’s historical
weighted average basic and diluted shares were assumed to be replaced by
the shares that CVS Health expected to issue as part of the consideration to
Aetna shareholders.
Exhibit 12.15 is the pro forma combined balance sheet for the CVS
Health-Aetna deal. It reflects the use of available cash for partial funding of
the transaction, elimination of trade receivables and payables between the
twocompanies,eliminationofAetna’shistoricalgoodwill,andcreationofan

the two businesses took still longer. Questions on this point lingered in
investors’ minds in February 2020 when the former Aetna Chief Executive
Officer resigned from CVS Health’s board and said the integration was “far

The lesson to draw is that pro forma statements may meticulously detail
the accounting ramifications of a business combination, but they cannot
fully capture the uncertainties inherent in trying to make two previously
independent companies mesh.
MULTIYEAR PROJECTIONS
So far, this chapter has focused on one-year projections and pro forma
adjustments to current financial statements. Such exercises, however,
represent nothing more than the foundation of a complete projection.
A fixed-income investor buying a 30-year bond is certainly interested in
the issuer’s financial prospects beyond a 12-month horizon. Similarly, a
substantial percentage of the present value of future dividends represented
by a stock’s price lies in years beyond the coming one. Even if particular
investors plan to hold the securities for one year or less, they have an
interest in estimating longer-term projections. Their ability, 6 or 12 months
hence, to sell at attractive prices will depend on other investors’ views at
the time of the issuer’s prospects.
The inherent volatility of economic conditions makes long-term projec-
tions a perilous undertaking. In the late 1970s, prognosticators generally
expected then-prevailing tightness in energy supplies to persist and worsen,

286 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
resulting in continued escalation of oil prices. The implications of this sce-
nario included large profits for oil producers and boom conditions for man-
ufacturers of oil exploration supplies, energy-conservation products, and
alternative-energy equipment. By the early 1980s, the energy picture had
changed from scarcity to glut, and many companies that had expected pros-
perity instead suffered bankruptcy. In subsequent years, numerous other
discontinuities have forced companies to revise their long-range plans. They
have included:
■ A wave of sovereign debt defaults by less developed countries in Latin
America.
■ A stock market crash on October 19, 1987.
■ A huge wave of leveraged buyout bankruptcies.
■ A war in the Persian Gulf.
■ A boom and bust in Internet stocks.
■ A financial crisis in Asia.
■ The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and World
TradeCenter,followedbynewwarsinthePersianGulfandAfghanistan.
■ The most severe financial crisis and recession since the 1930s, lasting
from 2007 to mid-2009 and leading to reduced expectations for
longer-run economic growth.
■ Beginningin2020,theCOVID-19pandemic,thedeadliestsucheventin
100 years, triggered a deep recession that could not have been foreseen
even shortly before it began.
The frequency of such shocks makes it difficult to have high confidence
in projections covering periods even as short as five years.
Notwithstanding their potential for badly missing the mark, multiyear
projections are essential to financial analysis in certain situations. For
example, some capital-intensive companies such as paper manufacturers
have long construction cycles. They add to their capacity not in steady,
annual increments but through large, individual plants that take several
years to build. While a plant is in construction, the company must pay
interest on the huge sums borrowed to finance it. This increased expense
depresses earnings until the point, several years out, when the new plant
comes onstream and begins to generate revenues. To obtain a true picture
of the company’s long-range financial condition, the analyst must somehow
factorintheincomestatementsforthefourthandfifthyearsoftheconstruc-
tionproject.Thesearefarmoredifficulttoforecastthanfirst-orsecond-year
results, which reflect cyclical peak borrowings and interest costs.

Forecasting Financial Statements 287
Radical financial restructurings also necessitate multiyear projections.
Examples include leveraged buyouts, megamergers, and massive stock
buybacks. The short-term impact of these transactions is to increase finan-
cial risk sharply. Often, leverage rises to a level investors are comfortable
with only if they believe the company will be able to reduce debt to more
customary levels within a few years. Sources of debt repayment may
include both cash flow and proceeds of planned asset sales. Analysts must
make projections to determine whether the plan for debt retirement rests
on realistic assumptions. A lender cannot prudently enter into a highly
leveraged transaction without making some attempt to project results over
several years, notwithstanding the uncertainties inherent in such long-range
forecasts.
Fortunately for analysts, today’s sophisticated financial modeling tools
make it feasible to run numerous scenarios for proposed transactions. Ana-
lysts can vary the underlying economic assumptions and deal terms as they
change from day to day. Once the company’s financial structure becomes
definitive, the analyst can input the final numbers into the spreadsheet.
From that point, the critical task is to monitor the restructured company’s
quarter-by-quarter progress, comparing actual results with projections.
Financial modeling tools are helpful in analyzing conventionally capi-
talized companies, as well as highly leveraged transactions. In projecting the
financials of companies with already-strong balance sheets, however, ana-
lysts should not assume that all excess cash flow will be directed toward
debt retirement. Conservatively capitalized companies generally do not seek
to reduce their financial leverage below some specified level. Instead, they
use surplus funds to repurchase stock or make acquisitions.
Essentially, multiyear projections involve the same sorts of assumptions
described in the one-year Colossal Chemical projection (Exhibits 12.1
through 12.12). When looking forward by as much as five years, though,
the analyst must be especially cognizant of the impact of the business
cycle. Many companies’ projected financial statements look fine as long as
sales grow like a hockey stick (sloping upward). Their financial strength
dissipates quickly, however, when sales turn downward for a year or two.
Notwithstanding the many uncertainties that confront the financial
forecaster, carefully constructed projections can prove fairly accurate. The
results can be satisfying even when the numbers are strongly influenced by
hard-to-predict economic variables. The detailed projections reproduced as
Exhibit 12.16 was generated by independent high-yield bond analyst Stan
Manoukian.
3 This exhibit shows how the bottom-up approach illustrated
in the fictitious Colossal Chemical example can be applied in real life to
companies outside the basic industry sphere.

What’s the Problem?
When things were doing well, Hertz was able to gradually increase the number of
rentalcarsintheU.S.from500,000in2014to535,000in2019(7percentincrease).
However, revenue per day has not materially increased from 2014; it has actually
declined from $46.07 in 2014 to $43.73 in 2019. At the same time, Avis, the closest
competitor,hasbeenabletogrowthenumberofU.S.carsby18percentandrevenue
per day by 38 percent. And looking at these differences, it is difficult not to draw
a conclusion about the quality of management at both companies. The issue is all
abouttheefficiencyofutilizationofeachcar.Thisefficiencyhasclearlybeensuperior
at Avis.
U.S. statistics 2014 2019 Changes
HTZ average fleet 499,100 534,879 7%

HTZ rev/day $46.07 $43.73 −5%
CAR rev/day $41.33 56.94 38%
When the economy started sinking, Hertz needed to materially shrink its fleet,
which needs a technical OK by ABS debt holders, since the fleet reduction cannot
negatively affect asset-backed securities (ABS) debtholders (see below). If Hertz can
sellitscarsefficiently,itsEBITDAwilldeclineinfullcorrelationwiththedeclineinthe
total number of cars. And in order to return to the normalized level operations, say
in 2022, Hertz will need to (a) get access to new ABS tranches and (b) demonstrate
superioroperatingperformance,whichisonlypossibleifitcankeepitsmarketshare.
We highly doubt that these steps will be possible to accomplish by 2022.

1. Depreciation of the revenue-earning equipment;
2. Interest on vehicle debt;
3. Fleet capital expenditure (capex) purchases;
4. Fleet capex disposals.
The company’s corporate EBITDA reported in financial statements already
incorporates all expense associated with the acquisition and financial maintenance
of all U.S. cars. Almost 100 percent of the U.S. fleet is financed by ABS tranches.
The Parent company makes lease payments, depreciation payments, and interest
payments to HVF II and it distributes it to holders of ABS debt.

Non-program vehicles to be sold 154,903
Total vehicles to be sold 182,521
Hertz has committed to cover the difference to ABS debt. In exchange, Hertz
can pocket $900 per car sold. It is unclear if the demand for used cars will continue
as robust as it is today. It is also unclear when the travel rate starts normalizing to
the pre-crisis level.

Balance Sheet & Operations
The Parent company’s first lien debt is paid the interest during the bankruptcy. The
interest on the 2nd-lien debt and unsecured debt accrues.
The balance of the ABS debt as of May 31, 2020, was $10,172mm versus
$10,893mm as of May 20, 2020. It is clear that Hertz has been aggressively selling
its fleet. The company states that LTV ratio as of May 31, 2020, was 89.1 percent,
with $975mm of the over-collateralization:

from the expected sales per car of $22,715. We have also looked at prices of Hertz

CONCLUSION
Of the various types of analysis of financial statements, projecting future
results and ratios requires the greatest skill and produces the most
valuable findings. Looking forward is also the riskiest form of analysis,
since there are no correct answers until the future statements appear.
Totally unforeseeable events may invalidate the assumptions underlying the
forecast; economic shocks or unexpected changes in a company’s financial
strategies may knock all calculations into a cocked hat.
The prominence of the chance element in the forecasting process means
that analysts should not be disheartened if their predictions miss the mark,
even widely on occasion. They should aim not for absolute prescience but

300 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
rather for a sound probabilistic model of the future. The model should log-
ically incorporate all significant evidence, both within and external to the
historical statements. An analyst can then judge whether a company’s pre-
vailing valuations (e.g., stock price, credit rating) are consistent with the
possible scenarios and their respective probabilities.
By tracking the after-the-fact accuracy of a number of projections, an
analyst can gauge the effectiveness of these methods. Invariably, there will
be room for further refinement, particularly in the area of gathering infor-
mation on industry conditions. No matter how refined the methods are,
however, perfection will always elude the modeler since no business cycle
precisely recapitulates its predecessor. That is what ultimately makes look-
ing forward with financial statements such a challenging task. The lack of
a predictable, recurring pattern is also what makes financial forecasting so
valuable. When betting huge sums in the face of massive uncertainty, it is
essential that investors understand the odds as fully as they possibly can.

CHAPTER 13
Credit Analysis
C
redit analysis is one of the most common uses of financial statements,
reflecting the many forms of debt that are essential to the operation of a
modern economy. Merchants who exchange goods for promises to pay need
toevaluatethereliabilityofthosepromises.Commercialbanksthatlendthe
merchants the funds to finance their inventories likewise need to calculate
the probability of being repaid in full and on time. The banks must in turn
demonstrate their creditworthiness to other financial institutions that lend
to them by purchasing their certificates of deposit and bonds. In all of these
cases, financial statement analysis can significantly influence a decision to
extend or not to extend credit.
As important as financial statements are to the evaluation of credit risk,
however, the analyst must bear in mind that other procedures also play
a role. Financial statements tell much about a borrower’sability to repay a
loan but disclose little about the equally importantwillingness to repay.
Accordingly, a thorough credit analysis may have to include a check of the
subject’s past record of repayment, which is not part of a standard financial
statement. Moreover, to assess the creditworthiness of the merchant in this
example, the bank must consider, along with the balance sheet and income
statement, the competitive environment and strength of the local economy
in which the borrower operates. Lenders to the bank will in turn consider
not only the bank’s financial position but also public policy. Believing that
a sound banking system benefits the economy as a whole, national govern-
ments empower central banks to act as lenders of last resort. As a result,
fewer bank failures occur than would be the case under pure, unrestrained
competition.
An even more basic reason that analyzing a company’s financial state-
ments may not be sufficient for determining its credit quality is that the bor-
rower’s credit may be supported, formally or informally, by another entity.

302 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
Many municipalities obtain cost savings on their financings by having their
debt payments guaranteed by bond insurers with premier credit ratings.
For holders of these municipal bonds, the insurer’s creditworthiness, not the
municipality’s financial condition, isthebasisfordetermining thelikelihood
of repayment. Corporations, too, sometimes guarantee the debt of weaker
credits.Evenwhenthestrongercompanydoesnottakeonalegalobligation
topayiftheweakercompanyfailsonitsdebt,implicitsupportmayaffectthe
latter’s credit quality. If a company is dependent on raw materials provided
by a subsidiary, there may be a reasonable presumption that it will stand
behind the subsidiary’s debt, even in the absence of a formal guarantee.
Keeping in mind that the final judgment may be influenced by other
informationaswell,theanalystcanbegintoextractfromthefinancialstate-
ments the data that bear on credit risk. Each of the basic statements – the
balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows – yields valu-
ableinsightswhenstudiedthroughratioanalysistechniques,aswellaswhen
used in the evaluation of fixed-income securities. In each case, the analyst
must temper any enthusiasm generated by a review of historical statements
with caution based on a consideration of financial ratios derived from pro-
jected statements for future years.
BALANCE SHEET RATIOS
The most immediate danger faced by a lender is the risk that the borrower
will suffer illiquidity – an inability to raise cash to pay its obligations. This
condition can arise for many reasons, one of which is a loss of ability to
borrow new funds to pay off existing creditors. Whatever the underlying
cause, however, illiquidity manifests itself as an excess of current cash pay-
ments due, over cash currently available. The current ratio gauges the risk
of this occurring by comparing the claims against the company that will
become payable during the current operating cycle (current liabilities) with
the assets that are already in the form of cash or that will be converted to
cash during the current operating cycle (current assets). Referring to capital
goods manufacturer Illinois Tool Works’s balance sheet (Exhibit 13.1), the
company’s current ratio as of December 31, 2019, was 2.90:
Current ratio= Current assets
Current liabilities= $6,253
$2,154 = 2.90
Analysts also apply a more stringent test of liquidity by calculating the
quick ratio, or acid test, which considers only cash and current assets that

ables). Illinois Tool Works’s quick ratio on December 31, 2019, was 2.06:
Quick ratio= Quick assets
Current liabilities= $1,981+2,461
$2,154 = 2.06
Besides looking at the ratio between current assets and current liabili-
ties,itisalsouseful,whenassessingacompany’sabilitytomeetitsnear-term
obligations, to consider the difference between the two, which is termed
working capital. Referring once again to Exhibit 13.1, working capital is
$4.099 billion.
Working capital= Current assets− Current liabilities
$4,099 = $6,253 − $2,154
Analysisofcurrentassetsandcurrentliabilitiesprovideswarningsabout
impending illiquidity, but lenders nevertheless periodically find themselves
saddled with loans to borrowers that are unable to continue meeting their
obligations and are therefore forced to file for bankruptcy. Recognizing that
they may one day find themselves holding defaulted obligations, creditors
wish to know how much asset value will be available for liquidation to pay
off their claims.
1 The various ratios that address this issue can be grouped
as measures of financial leverage.
A direct measure of asset protection is the ratio of total assets to total
liabilities, which in the example shown in Exhibit 13.1 comes to:
Total assets
Total liabilities= $15,068
$2,154+9,884 = 1.25
Note that total liabilities (short-term and long-term) of $12.038 billion
are equivalent to total assets less shareholders’ equity. Looking at it another
way, IllinoisTool Works’s assetsof $15.068 billioncould decline in value by
20 percent before proceeds of a liquidation would be insufficient to satisfy
lenders’ claims. The greater the amount by which asset values could dete-
riorate, the greater the equity cushion (equity is, by definition, total assets
minustotalliabilities),andthegreaterthecreditor’ssenseofbeingprotected.
Lendersalsogaugetheamountofequity“beneath”them(juniortothem

1.0, it is convenient to express the relationship as a debt-equity ratio:

Banks’ capital adequacy is commonly measured by the ratio of equity
to total assets:

Many pages of elaboration could follow on the last few ratios men-
tioned. Their calculation is rather less simple than it might appear. The
reason is that aggressive borrowers frequently try to satisfy the letter of a
maximum leverage limit imposed by lenders without fulfilling the conserva-
tivespiritbehindit.Thefollowingdiscussionofdefinitionsofleverageratios
addresses the major issues without laying down absolute rules about correct
calculations. As explained later in the chapter, ratios are most meaningful
when compared across time and across borrower. Consequently, the precise
method of calculation is less important than the consistency of calculation
throughout the sample being compared.
What Constitutes Total Debt?
At one time, it was appropriate to consider only long-term debt in leverage
calculations for industrial companies, since short-term debt was generally
used for seasonal purposes, such as financing Christmas-related inventory.
A company might draw down bank lines or issue commercial paper to meet
these funding requirements, then completely pay off the interim borrowings
when it sold the inventory. Even today, a firm that zeros out its short-term
debtatsomepointineachoperatingcyclecanlegitimatelyarguethatitstrue
leverage is represented by the permanent (long-term) debt on its balance
sheet. Many borrowers have long since subverted this principle, however,
by relying heavily on short-term debt that they neither repay on an interim
basis nor fund (replace with long-term debt) when it grows to sufficient size
tomakeabondofferingcost-effective.Suchshort-termdebtmustbeviewed
as permanent and included in the leverage calculation. (Current maturities
of long-term debt should also enter into the calculation of total debt, based
on a conservative assumption that the company will replace maturing debt
with new long-term borrowings.)

306 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
As an aside, the just-described reliance on short-term debt is not neces-
sarily as dangerous a practice as in years past, although it should still raise
a caution flag for the credit analyst. Two risks are inherent in depending on
debt with maturities of less than one year. The first is potential illiquidity.
If substantial debt comes due at a time when lenders are either unable to
renew their loans (because credit is tight) or unwilling to renew (because
they perceive the borrower as less creditworthy than formerly), the bor-
rower may be unable to meet its near-term obligations. This risk may be
mitigated, however, if the borrower has a revolving credit agreement, which
is a longer-term commitment by the lender to lend (subject to certain con-
ditions, such as maintaining prescribed financial ratios and refraining from
significantchangesinthebusiness).Thesecondriskofrelyingonshort-term
borrowings is exposure to interest-rate fluctuations. If a substantial amount
of debt is about to come due, and interest rates have risen sharply since the
debt was incurred, the borrower’s cost of staying in business may skyrocket
overnight.
Note that exposure to interest rate fluctuations can also arise from
long-termfloating-ratedebt. Companiescanlimitthisriskbyusing financial
derivatives. One approach is to cap the borrower’s interest rate, that is,
set a maximum rate that will prevail, no matter how high the market rate
against which it is pegged may rise. Alternatively, the borrower can convert
the floating-rate debt tofixed-rate debtthrough a derivative known as an
interest-rate swap. (The forces of supply and demand may make it more
economical for the company to issue floating-rate debt and incur the cost
of the swap than to take the more direct route to the same net effect, that
is, to issue fixed-rate debt.) Public financial statements typically provide
only general information about the extent to which the issuer has limited
its exposure to interest rate fluctuations through derivatives.
Borrowers sometimes argue that the total debt calculation should
exclude debt that is convertible, at the lender’s option, into common equity.
Hard-liners on the credit analysis side respond: “It’s equity when the
holders convert it to equity. Until then, it’s debt.” Realistically, though, if
the conversion value of the bond rises sufficiently, most holders will in fact
convert their securities to common stock. This is particularly true if the
issuer has the option of calling the bonds for early retirement, which results
in a loss for holders who fail to convert. Analysts should remember that
the ultimate objective is not to calculate ratios for their own sake but to
assess credit risk. Therefore, the best practice is to count convertible debt in
total debt but to consider the possibility of conversion when comparing the
borrower’s leverage with that of its peer group.

Credit Analysis 307
Preferred stock2 is a security that further complicates the leverage
calculation. From a legal standpoint, preferred stock is clearly equity; in
liquidation, it ranks junior to debt. Preferred stock pays a dividend rather
than interest, and failure to pay the dividend does not constitute a default.
On the other hand, preferred dividends, unlike common dividends, are con-
tractually fixed in amount. An issuer can omit its preferred dividend but not
without also omitting its common dividend. Furthermore, many preferred
dividends are cumulative, meaning that the issuer must repay all pre-
ferred dividend arrearages before resuming common stock dividends.
Furthermore, companies are reluctant to omit preferred dividends because
doing so sends an unwanted signal of financial strain to the market.
For these reasons, treating preferred stock purely as equity for credit
analysis purposes would understate financial risk. A formal way to take this
risk into account is to calculate the ratio of total fixed obligations to total
capital:

Total debt+Minority interest+Preferred stock

Generally speaking, pension obligations that have been fully funded

credit worries for a going concern. Likewise, a modest underfunding that
is in the process of being remediated by an essentially sound company is
no more than a small qualitative factor on the negative side. On the other

consideration – albeit one that is hard to quantify explicitly – in assessing a
deteriorating credit. In bankruptcy, it becomes essential to monitor details
of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s efforts to assert its claim to
the company’s assets, which, if successful, reduce the settlement amounts
available to other creditors.
Are Deferred Taxes Part of Capital?
Near the equity account on many companies’ balance sheets appears an
account labeled “Deferred Income Taxes.” This item represents the cumu-
lative difference between taxes calculated at the statutory rate and taxes
actually paid. The difference reflects the tax consequences, for future years,
of the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Many analysts argue that net worth is understated by the amount of
the deferred tax liability, since it will in all likelihood never come due and
is therefore not really a liability at all. (As long as the company continues
to pay taxes at less than the statutory rate, the deferred tax account will
continue to grow.) Proponents of this view adjust for the alleged under-
statement of net worth by adding deferred taxes to the denominator in the
total-debt-to-total-capital calculation, thus:
Total debt
Total debt+Deferred taxes+Minority interest+Total equity
In general, this practice is sound. Analysts must, however, keep in mind
that the precise formula for calculating a ratio is less important than the
assurancethatitiscalculatedconsistentlyforallcompaniesbeingevaluated.
The caveat is that many factors can contribute to deferred taxes, and not all
of them imply a permanent deferral. A defense contractor, for example, can
defer payment of taxes related to a specific contract until the contract is
completed. The analyst would not want to add to equity the taxes deferred
on a contract that is about to be completed, although in such situations
specific figures may be hard to obtain.
The Importance of Management’s Attitude toward Debt
As the preceding discussion has established, companies use numerous
gambits in their quest to enjoy the benefits of aggressive financial leverage
without suffering the consequences of low credit ratings and high bor-
rowing costs. Analysts should note that corporations’ bag of tricks is not

confined to accounting gimmicks. Some management teams also rely on a
bait-and-switch technique.
The ploy consists of announcing that management has learned the hard
way that conservative financial policies serve shareholders best in the long
run.Neveragain,vowsthechiefexecutiveofficer,willthecompanyundergo

that these actions create among credit analysts who rely heavily on trends
in financial ratios, the company floats new long-term bonds at an attractive
rate. Once the cash is in the coffers, management loses its motivation to
present a conservative face to lenders and reverts to the aggressive financial
policies that so recently got the company into trouble.
Not everybody is taken in by this ruse. Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s
placeheavyemphasisonmanagement’sattitudetowarddebtwhenassigning
bondratings(see“RelatingRatiostoCreditRisk”laterinthischapter).They
strive to avoid upgrading companies in response to balance sheet improve-
mentsthatareunlikelytolastmuchbeyondthecompletionofthenextpublic
offering. As a reward for such vigilance, the agencies are routinely accused
ofbeingbackward-looking. Thecorporationscomplainthatthebondraters
are dwelling unduly on past, weaker financial ratios. In reality, the agen-
cies are thinking ahead. Based on their experience with management, they
are inferring that the recent reduction in financial leverage reflects expedi-
ency, rather than a long-term shift in debt policy. In general, credit analysts
should assume that the achievement of higher bond ratings is a secondary
goal of corporate management. If a company’s stock has been languishing
for a while, management will not ordinarily feel any urgency about elim-
inating debt from the capital structure, an action that reduces return on
shareholders’ equity (see Chapter 14). Similarly, the typical chief executive
officer, being only human, finds it difficult to resist a chance to run a sub-
stantiallybiggercompany.Therefore,ifamammothacquisitionopportunity
comes along, the CEO is likely to pursue it, even if it means borrowing huge
amounts of money and precipitating a rating downgrade, rather than the
hoped-for upgrade.
Like other types of financial statement analysis, finding meaning in a
company’s balance sheet requires the analyst to look ahead. When man-
agement’s probable future actions are taken into account, the company’s
prospects for repaying its debts on schedule may be better or worse than the
ratios imply. The credit analyst cannot afford to take management’s repre-
sentations at face value, however. When a chief executive officer claims that
obtaining a higher bond rating is the corporation’s overriding objective, it is

when a prospective buyer asks whether management will stay on course for
a rating upgrade come hell or high water. The CEO casually replies, “Of
course, if a once-in-a-lifetime major acquisition opportunity were to come
along, and it required us to borrow, we would have to delay our plans for
debt reduction temporarily.” The credit analyst can generally assume that
shortly after the bond deal closes, the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will
materialize.
INCOME STATEMENT RATIOS
Although an older approach to credit analysis places primary emphasis on
liquidity and asset protection, both of which are measured by balance sheet
ratios,themorecontemporaryviewisthatprofitsareultimatelywhatsustain
liquidity and asset values. High profits keep plenty of cash flowing through
the system and confirm the value of productive assets such as plant and
equipment. In line with this latter view, the income statement is no longer of
interestmainlytotheequityanalystbutisessentialtocreditanalysisaswell.
A key income statement focus for credit analysis is the borrower’s profit
margin(profitasapercentageofsales).Thenarrowerthemargin,thegreater
the danger that a modest decline in selling prices or a modest increase in
costs will produce losses, which will in turn begin to erode such balance
sheet measures as total debt to total capital by reducing equity.
Profit can be measured at several levels of the income statement, either
before or after deducting various expenses to get to the bottom line, net
income. The most commonly used profit margins are the following:
Gross margin= Sales−Cost of goods sold
Sales
Operating margin= Net income+Income taxes+Interest expense
Interest income−Other income

Pretax margin= Net income+Income taxes

statements. Some differences are merely semantic, but others are substan-
tive. This fact does not negate the value obtainable from calculating and
comparing ratios. It is just one of several reasons why, as detailed later in
this chapter, ratio-based analysis must be supplemented with other analyses
to arrive at valid conclusions.

credit profile. Credit analysts must delve into the numbers to confirm that
management is continuing to reinvest in the business in order to preserve
long-run profitability. The risk is that management will instead cut invest-
ment spending, thereby elevating near-term profits in hopes of boosting the
stock price.
Observe that for some companies, deducting other income, as called
for by the operating margin formula, will result in an addback of a nega-
tive figure. In some instances, an after-tax nonoperating item can produce
a disparity between the numerators in the pretax and operating margins, as
calculated from the bottom up in accordance with the formula, and the cor-
responding figure derived by working from the top down. For example, the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting procedures will appear below
the line, that is, after income taxes have already been deducted. The sum of
net income and provision for income taxes will then differ from the pretax
incomefigurethatappearsintheincomestatement.Toensurecomparability
across companies, analysts should take care to follow identical procedures
in calculating each company’s margins, rather than adopting shortcuts that
may introduce distortion.
The various margin measures reflect different aspects of management’s
effectiveness. Gross margin, which is particularly important in analyzing
retailers,measuresmanagement’sskillinbuyingandsellingatadvantageous
prices. Operating margin shows how well management has run the busi-
ness – buying and selling wisely and controlling selling and administrative
expenses – before taking into account financial policies (which largely deter-
mine interest expense) and the tax rate (which is outside management’s con-
trol).
5 These last two factors are sequentially added to the picture by cal-
culating pretax margin and net margin, with the latter ratio reflecting all
factors, whether under management’s control or not, that influence prof-
itability.
In calculating profit margins, analysts should eliminate the effect of
extraordinary gains and losses to determine the level of profitability that is
likely to be sustainable in the future.
Fixed-charge coverage is the other category of income statement ratios
of keen interest to credit analysts. It measures the ability of a company’s

earnings to meet the interest payments on its debt, the lender’s most direct

adjustments involve capitalized interest and payments on operating leases.
Capitalized Interest
Under SFAS 34, a company may be required to capitalize, rather than
expense, a portion of its interest costs. The underlying notion is that like
the actual bricks and mortar purchased to construct a plant, the cost
of the money borrowed to finance the purchase provides benefits in future

periods and therefore should not be entirely written off in the first year.
Whether it is expensed or capitalized, however, all interest incurred must
be covered by earnings and should therefore appear in the denominator of
the fixed-charge coverage calculation. Accordingly, the basic formula can
be rewritten to include not only the interest expense shown on the income
statement but also capitalized interest, which may appear either on the
income statement or in the notes to financial statements. (If the amount is
immaterial, capitalized interest will not be shown at all, and the analyst
can skip this adjustment.) The numerator should not include capitalized
interest, however, for the amount is a reduction to total expenses and
consequently reflected in net income. Including capitalized interest in the
numerator would therefore constitute double counting:
Fixed-charge coverage
(adjusted for
capitalized interest)
= Net income+Income taxes+Income expense
Interest expense+Capitalized interest
Lease Expense
As mentioned above, off-balance-sheet operating leases have virtually
the same economic impact as on-balance-sheet debt. Just as credit ana-
lysts should take into account the liabilities represented by these leases,
they should also factor into coverage calculations the annual fixed charges
associated with them.
One approach to taking the impact of leases into account simply adds
the total current-year rental expense from notes to financial statements to
both the numerator and denominator of the fixed-charge coverage calcu-
lation. An alternate method includes one-third of rentals (as shown in the
following calculation) on the theory that one-third of a lease payment typi-
cally represents interest that would be paid if the assets had been purchased
with borrowed money, and two-thirds is equivalent to principal repayment:
Fixed-charge coverage
(adjusted for capitalized
interest and operating leases)
=
Net income+Income taxes
+Income expense+
1∕3 Rentals
Interest expense
+Capitalized interest+ 1∕3 Rentals
Two complications arise in connection with incorporating operating
lease payment into the fixed-charge coverage calculation. First, the SEC
doesnotrequirecompaniestoreportrentalexpenseinquarterlystatements.
The analyst can therefore only estimate where a company’s fully adjusted
coverage stands, on an interim basis, in relation to its most recent full-year

some companies voluntarily report capitalized interest on an interim basis.)
Second, retailers in particular often negotiate leases with rents that are
semifixed, tied in part to revenues of the leased stores. Some argue that
the variable portion – contingent rentals – should be excluded from the
fixed-charge coverage calculation. That approach, however, results in a
numerator that includes income derived from revenues in excess of the
threshold level, while omitting from the denominator charges that were
automatically incurred when the threshold was reached. A better way
to recognize the possible avoidance of contingent lease payments is by
capitalizing only the mandatory portion when calculating the balance sheet
ratio of total debt to total capital.
Interest Income
Afinalissuerelatedtofixed-chargecoverageinvolvesinterestincome.Com-
panies sometimes argue that the denominator should include only net inter-
estexpense:thedifferencebetweeninterestexpenseandincomederivedfrom
interest-bearing assets, generally consisting of marketable securities. They
portray the two items as offsetting, with operating earnings having to cover
only the portion of interest expense not automatically paid for by interest
income. Such treatment can be deceptive, however, when a company holds
a large but temporary portfolio of marketable securities. In this situation,
fixed-charge coverage based on net interest expense in the current year can
greatly overstate the level of protection that may be expected in the suc-
ceeding year, after the company has invested its funds in operating assets. If,
however, a company’s strategy is to invest a substantial portion of its assets
indefinitely in marketable securities (as some pharmaceutical manufacturers
do, to capture certain tax benefits), analysts should consider the associated
liquidity as a positive factor in their analysis.
STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS RATIOS
Ratios related to sources and uses of funds measure credit quality at the
most elemental level – a company’s ability to generate sufficient cash to pay
its bills. These ratios also disclose a great deal about financial flexibility; a
company that does not have to rely on external financing can take greater
operating risks than one that would be forced to retrench if new capital
suddenly became scarce or prohibitively expensive. In addition, trends in

shareholders’ interest, a recurrent cash shortfall is likely to be made up with
debt financing, leading to a rise in the total-debt-to-total-capital ratio.
Forcapital-intensivemanufacturersandutilities,akeyratioiscashflow
to capital expenditures:
Cash flow from operations
Capital expenditures
The higher this ratio, the greater the financial flexibility implied. It
is important, though, to examine the reasons underlying a change in the
relationship between internal funds and capital outlays. It is normal for a
capital-intensive industry to go through a capital-spending cycle, adding
capacity by constructing large-scale plants that require several years to
complete. Once the new capacity is in place, capital expenditures ease for a
few years until demand growth catches up and another round of spending
begins. Over the cycle, the industry’s ratio of cash falls. By definition, the
down leg of this cycle does not imply long-term deterioration in credit
quality. In contrast, a company that suffers a prolonged downtrend in its
ratio of cash flow to capital expenditures is likely to get more deeply into
debt and therefore become financially riskier with each succeeding year.
Likewise, a rising ratio may require interpretation. A company that sharply
reduces its capital budget will appear to increase its financial flexibility,
based on the cash-flow-to-capital-expenditures ratio. Cutting back on
outlays, however, may impair the company’s long-run competitiveness
by sacrificing market share or by causing the company to fall behind in
technological terms.
Although the most recent period’s ratio of cash flow to capital expen-
ditures is a useful measure, the credit analyst is always more interested in
the future than in the past. One good way of assessing a company’s ability
to sustain its existing level of cash adequacy is to calculate depreciation as a
percentage of cash flow:
Depreciation
Cash flow from operations
Unlike earnings, depreciation is essentially a programmed item, a cash
flow assuredbytheaccounting rules.Thehigher thepercentage ofcash flow
derived from depreciation, the more predictable a company’s cash flow and
the less dependent its financial flexibility on the vagaries of the marketplace.
Also important among the ratios derived from the statement of cash
flows is the ratio of capital expenditures to depreciation:
Capital expenditures
Depreciation

A ratio of less than 1.0 over a period of several years raises a red flag,
since it suggests that the company is failing to replace its plant and equip-
ment.Underspendingoncapitalreplacementamountstogradualliquidation

on plant and equipment today will not buy as much capacity as it did when
the depreciating asset was acquired. (Technological advances in production
processes may mitigate this problem because the cost in real terms of pro-
ducing one unit may have declined since the company purchased the equip-
ment now being replaced.) A second reason to avoid complacency over a
seemingly strong ratio of capital expenditures to depreciation is that the
depreciation may be understated with respect either to wear and tear or
to obsolescence. If so, the adequacy of capital spending will be overstated
by the ratio of capital spending to depreciation. Finally, capital outlays may
be too low even if they match in every sense the depreciation of existing
plant and equipment. In a growth industry, a company that fails to expand
its capacity at roughly the same rate as its competitors may lose essential
economies of scale and fall victim to ashakeout.
Credit analysts carry further the concept underlying the ratio of capital
expenditurestodepreciationbybringingothercashflowitemsanddividends
into the picture and calculating free cash flow as follows:
F r e eC a s hF l o w= Cash Flow from Operating Activities
−Capital Expenditures−Dividends
Some credit analysts who focus on debt of highly leveraged companies
put primary emphasis on a company’s ability to generate positive free cash
flow. They reason that as long as a company has sufficient cash flow to
replace its fixed assets and satisfy shareholders’ demands for payout of a
portion of profits, it will not be dependent on outside financing. Manage-
ment will have the option of retiring debt and thereby reducing financial
risk. The key question, naturally, is whether the profitability underlying the
cash flow from operating activities is sustainable.
COMBINATION RATIOS
Each of the financial ratios discussed so far in this chapter is derived from
numbers collected from just one of the three basic financial statements.
In financial analysis, these rudimentary tools are analogous to the simple

machines – the wedge, the lever, the wheel, and the screw – that greatly
increased the productivity of their prehistoric inventors. How much more
remarkable an advance it was, however, when an anonymous Chinese
person combined two simple machines, a lever and a wheel, to create
a wheelbarrow! In similar fashion, combining numbers from different
financial statements unleashes vast new analytical power.
Rate-of-Return Measures
One of the most valuable types of combination ratios combines earnings
with balance sheet figures. Such ratios measure the profit that an enterprise
isgeneratingrelativetotheassetsemployedorthecapitalinvestedinit.This
kind of measure provides a link between credit analysis and the economic
concept of productivity of capital.

If we look only at net margin, a ratio derived solely from the income state-
ment, Company A issuperior tobothitsdirectcompetitor, Company B,and
Company C, which is in a different business. Looking at the combination
ratio of return on equity, however, we find that Company C ranks highest,
notwithstanding that sales margins tend to be narrower in its industry:
Company A Company B Company C
Sales $1,000,000 $1,000,000 $2,000,000
Net income 50,000 40,000 60,000

)
Return on equity 10.0% 8.0% 12.0%(

10 percent in Company A and Company B’s industry will seek to shift their
capitaltoCompanyC’sindustry,where12percentreturnsareavailable.The

have greater difficulty raising funds and therefore less financial flexibility.
The credit impact on Company C, conversely, is favorable.

320 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
There are several variants of the rate-of-return combination ratio, each
with a specific analytical application. Return on equity, which has already
been alluded to, measures a firm’s productivity of equity and therefore pro-
vides an indication of its ability to attract a form of capital that provides an
important cushion for the debtholders:
Return on equity= Net income
Common equity+Preferred equity
In calculating this ratio, analysts most commonly use as the denomina-
tor equity as of the final day of the year in which the company earned the
income shown in the numerator. This method may sometimes produce dis-
tortions.Acompanymightraiseasubstantialamountofnewequitynearthe
end of the year. The denominator in the return-on-equity calculation would
consequently be increased, but the numerator would not reflect the benefit
of a full year’s earnings on the new equity because it was employed in the
business for only a few days. Under these circumstances, return on equity
will compare unfavorably (and unfairly) with that of a company that did
not abruptly expand its equity base.
The potential for distortion in the return-on-equity calculation can be
reduced somewhat by substituting for end-of-year equity so-called average
equity:
Return on
average equity = Net income
(Equity at beginning of year+Equity at end of year)
2
(Some analysts prefer this method to the year-end-based calculation,
even when sudden changes in the equity account are not an issue.)
Anotherlimitationofcombinationratiosthatincorporatebalancesheet
figures is that they have little meaning if calculated for portions of years.
Suppose that in 2018 a company earns $6 million on year-end equity of
$80 million, for a return on equity of 7.5 percent. During the first half of
2019, its net income is $4 million, of which it pays out $2 million in divi-
dends, leaving it $82 million in equity at June 30, 2019. With the company
having earned in half a year two-thirds as much as it did during all of 2018,
it is illogical to conclude that its return on equity has fallen from 7.5 percent
to 4.9 percent ($4 million÷ $82 million).
To derive a proper return on equity, it is necessary to annualize the
earnings figure. Merely doubling the first half results can introduce some
distortion, though, since the company’s earnings may be seasonal. Even if

not, there is no assurance that the first-half rate of profitability will be
sustainedinthesecondhalf.Accordingly,thebestwaytoannualizeearnings
is to calculate a trailing 12-months’ figure:
Net income for second half of 2018+Net income for first half of 2019
Equity at June 30, 2019
If the analyst is working with the company’s 2018 annual report and
2019second-quarter statement, 2018second-half earnings will not be avail-
able without backing out some numbers. For ease of calculation, the numer-
ator in the preceding ratio can be derived as follows:
Net income for full year 2018.
Less: Net income for first half of 2018.
Plus: Net income for first half of 2019.
For the credit analyst, return on equity alone may be an insufficient or
even misleading measure. The reason is that a company can raise its return
on equity by increasing the proportion of debt in its capital structure, a
change that reduces credit quality. In Exhibit 13.3, Company Y produces
ahigherreturnonequitythanthemoreconservativelycapitalizedCompany
X, even though both have equivalent operating margins.
Note that Company Y enjoys its edge despite having to pay a higher
interest rate on account of its riskier financial structure.
Income statement ratios such as net margin and fixed-charge coverage,
which point to higher credit quality at Company X, serve as a check against
return on equity, which ranks Company Y higher. A later section of this
chapter explores systematic approaches to reconciling financial ratios that
give contradictory indications about the relative credit quality of two or
more companies. The more immediately relevant point, however, is that
other combination ratios can also be used as checks against an artificially
heightened return on equity. Using the same figures for Companies X and Y,
the analyst can calculate return on total capital, which equalizes for differ-
encesincapitalstructure.Onthisbasis,CompanyYenjoysonlyanegligible
advantage related to its slower growth in retained earnings (and hence in
capital):
Return on total capital= Net income+Income taxes+Interest expense
Total debt+Total equity
Company X Company Y

25.0+81.4 = 16.5
106.4 = 15.5% 7.9+4.1+4.5
50.0+55.3 = 16.5
105.3 = 15.7%

Total debt in this calculation includes short-term debt, current matu-
rities of long-term debt, and long-term debt, for reasons described earlier
under “What Constitutes Total Debt?” Similarly, total equity includes both
preferred and preference stock. If there is a minority interest, the associated

amount in the denominator.
Turnover Measures
In addition to measuring return on investment, a particular type of combi-
nation ratio known as a turnover ratio can provide valuable information
about asset quality. The underlying notion of a turnover ratio is that a com-
pany requires a certain level of receivables and inventory to support a given
volume of sales. For example, if a manufacturer sells its goods on terms
that require payment within 30 days, and all customers pay exactly on time,
accounts receivable on any given day (barring seasonality in sales) will be
30 ÷ 365, or 8.2 percent of annual sales. Coming at the question from the
opposite direction, the analyst can calculate the average length of time that
a receivable remains outstanding before it is paid (the calculation uses the
average amount of receivables outstanding during the year):
Average days of receivables= (A∕R beginning of year+A∕R end of year)
2
×365 Annual sales
Thisratioenablestheanalysttolearnthecompany’strueaveragecollec-
tion period, which may differ significantly from its stated collection period.
By inverting the first portion of the average days of receivables calcula-
tion, one can determine how many times per year the company turns over
its receivables:
Receivables turnover= Annual sales
(ARBY+AREY)
2
where: ARBY = Accounts receivable at beginning of year
AREY = Accounts receivable at the end of year
As long as a company continues to sell on the same terms, its required
receivables level will rise as its sales rise, but the ratio between the two
should not change. A decline in the ratio may signal that the company’s
customers are paying more slowly because they are encountering financial
difficulties. Alternatively, the company may be trying to increase its sales
by liberalizing its credit standards, allowing its salespeople to do more
business with less financially capable customers. Either way, the ultimate

324 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
collectability of the accounts receivable shown on the balance sheet has
become less certain. Unless the company has reflected this fact by increasing
its allowance for doubtful receivables, it may have to write off a portion
of receivables against income at some point in the future. The analyst
should therefore adjust the company’s total-debt-to-total-capital ratio for
the implicit overstatement of equity.
Another asset quality problem that can be detected with a combina-
tionratioinvolvesunsalableinventory.Afashionretailer’sleftovergarments
fromtheprecedingseasonoranelectronicsmanufacturer’sobsoletefinished
goodscanbeworthfarlessthantheirbalancesheetvalues(historicalcost).If
the company is postponing an inevitable write-off, it may become apparent
through a rise in inventory without a commensurate rise in sales, resulting
in a decline in inventory turnover:
Receivables turnover= Annual sales
(IBY+IEY)
2
where: IBY = Inventory at beginning of year
IEY = Inventory at end of year
A drop in sales is another possible explanation of declining inventory
turnover. In this case, the inventory may not have suffered a severe reduc-
tion in value, but there are nevertheless unfavorable implications for credit
quality. Until the inventory glut can be worked off by cutting back produc-
tion to match the lower sales volume, the company may have to borrow to
finance its unusually high working capital, thereby increasing its financial
leverage. Profitability may also suffer as the company cuts its selling prices,
accepting a lower margin to eliminate excess inventory.
One objection to the preceding inventory-turnover calculation involves
thevariabilityofsellingprices.Supposethatthepriceofacommoditychem-
ical suddenly shoots up as the result of a temporary shortage. A chemical
producer’s annual sales – and hence its inventory turnover – may rise, yet
the company may not be physically moving its inventory any faster than
before. Conversely, a retailer may respond to a drop in consumer demand
andcutitspricestoavoidabuildupofinventory.Theshelvesandbackroom
have no more product than previously, yet the ratio based on annual sales
indicates that turnover has declined.
To prevent such distortions, the analyst can use the following variant
ratio:
Inventory turnover= Annual cost of goods sold

Total-Debt-to-Cash-Flow Ratio
A final combination ratio that is invaluable in credit analysis is the ratio of
total debt to cash flow:
Total debt
to cash flow= Short-term debt+Current maturities+Long-term debt
Cash flow from operations
A less precise, but commonly used variant substitutes EBITDA for true
operating cash flow:
Total debt to EBITDA=
Short-term debt+Current maturities
+Long-term debt
Net income+Income taxes+Interest expense
+Depreciation+Amortization

invoked credit-quality measures, which are derived from the balance sheet

inherent flaw that equity may be understated or overstated relative to its
economic value. After all, the accounting rules do not permit a write-up

of assets unless they are sold, nor do the rules require a write-down until
someone makes the possibly subjective determination that the assets have
fallen in value. In comparison, total debt is an objective number, a dollar
amount that must contractually be repaid. Fixed-charge coverage, too, has
a weakness, for it is based on earnings, which are subject to considerable
manipulation. Cash flow eliminates one major opportunity for manipu-
lation: under-depreciation. If a company inflates its reported earnings by
writing down its fixed assets more slowly than economic reality dictates,
it is merely taking money out of one cash flow pocket and putting it into
the other. Cash flow, then, puts companies on equal footing, whatever their
depreciation policies.
Built from two comparatively hard numbers, the ratio of total debt to
cash flow provides one of the best single measures of credit quality. Ana-
lysts should not worry about whether its literal interpretation – the period
required for a total liquidation of debt – is realistic but instead focus on its
analytical value.
RELATING RATIOS TO CREDIT RISK
Thediscussionoffinancialratiosuptothispointhassidesteppedanobvious
and critical question: How does an analyst who has calculated a ratio know
whether it represents good, bad, or indifferent credit quality? Somehow,
the analyst must relate the ratio to the likelihood that the borrower will
satisfy all scheduled interest and principal payments in full and on time.
In practice, this is accomplished by testing financial ratios as predictors
of the borrower’s propensity not to pay (to default). For example, a com-
pany with high financial leverage is statistically more likely to default than
one with low leverage, all other things being equal. Similarly, high fixed-
chargecoverageimplieslessdefaultriskthanlowcoverage.Afteridentifying
the factors that create high default risk, the analyst can use ratios to rank
all borrowers on a relative scale of propensity to default.
Many credit analysts conduct their ratio analyses within ranking frame-
worksestablishedbytheiremployers.Individualsengagedinprocessingloan
applications may use criteria derived from the lending institution’s experi-
ence over many years in recognizing the financial characteristics that lead
to timely payment or to default. In the securities field, bond ratings provide
a structure for analysis. Exhibits 13.4 and 13.5 show the rating definitions
of two leading bond-rating agencies, Moody’s Investors Service and Stan-
dard & Poor’s. (The following discussion uses the rating notations and their
corresponding spoken equivalents interchangeably – AAA and Triple-A, AA
and Double-A, and so on.)

EXHIBIT 13.4 Moody’s Bond Ratings (Definitions)
Long-Term Obligation Ratings
Moody’s long-term ratings are opinions of the relative credit risk of financial
obligations with an original maturity of one year or more. They address the
possibility that a financial obligation will not be honored as promised. Such
ratings use Moody’s Global Scale and reflect both the likelihood of default and
any financial loss suffered in the event of default.
Aaa Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with
minimal credit risk.
Aa Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to
very low credit risk.
A Obligations rated A are considered upper-medium grade and are subject
to low credit risk.
Baa Obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are
considered medium grade and as such may possess certain speculative
characteristics.
Ba Obligations rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements and are
subject to credit risk.
B Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high
credit risk.
Caa Obligations rated Caa are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to
very high credit risk.
Ca Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near,
default, with some prospect of recovery of principal or interest.
C Obligations rated C are the lowest rated class and are typically in default,
with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.
Note: Moody’s appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic rating clas-
sification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks
in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range

not address the percentage of principal that the lender is likely to recover in
the event of default. Certainly, expected recoveries have an important bear-
ing on the decision to extend or deny credit, as well as on the valuation of
debt securities. Bankruptcy analysis, however, is a huge topic by itself. It
goes well beyond comparing the actual value (as opposed to book value) of
the defaulted company’s assets with the amount of its liabilities, although
that is part of the relevant analysis. A comprehensive estimation of credi-
tors’ recoveries depends on a detailed knowledge of the relevant legislation
and a thorough understanding of the dynamics of the negotiations between
creditors and the management of a company in Chapter 11reorganization
proceedings. Such matters are beyond the scope of this book. For the securi-
ties of highly rated companies, moreover, the potential percentage recovery
of principal tends to be a comparatively minor valuation factor. Over the
short to intermediate term, the probability of a bankruptcy filing by such a
company is small.

sisinthesepages, Chapter 14isrelevant fromthestandpoint ofdetermining
the failed firm’s equity value, a key step in the reorganization or liquidation
of the company. In addition, the bibliography includes books that discuss
bankruptcy in extensive detail.
Comparative Ratio Analysis
The basic technique in assigning a relative credit ranking is to compare a
company’s ratio with those of a peer group. Size and line of business are the
key criteria for identifying a company’s peers.
On the matter of size, a manufacturer with $5 billion in annual sales
will ordinarily be a better credit risk than one with similar financial ratios
but only $50 million in sales. As a generalization, bigger companies enjoy
economiesofscaleandhavegreaterleveragewithsuppliersbyvirtueoftheir
largerpurchasingpower.Abigcompanycanspreadtherisksofobsolescence
and competitive challenges over a wide range of products and customers,
whereas a smaller competitor’s sales are likely to be concentrated on a few
products and customers. Particularly vulnerable is a company with just a
single manufacturing facility. An unexpected loss of production could prove
fataltosuchanenterprise.Lackofdepthinmanagementisanotherproblem
commonly associated with smaller companies.
Unquestionably, some very large companies have failed in the past.
There is ample evidence, as well, of inefficiency in many large, bureaucratic
organizations. The point, however, is not to debate whether big corpora-
tions are invincible or nimble, but to determine whether they meet their
obligations with greater regularity, on average, than their pint-size peers.

330 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
Statistical models of default risk confirm that they do. Therefore, the
bond-rating agencies are following sound methodology when they create
size-based peer groups.
Line of business is another basis for defining a peer group. Because dif-
ferent industries have different financial characteristics, ratio comparisons
acrossindustrylinesmaynotbevalid.Amachinerymanufacturer’ssalesmay
fluctuate substantially over the capital goods cycle. In contrast, a personal
careproductsmanufacturerderivesitsrevenuesfromessentialproductsthat
are in demand year in and year out. The personal care products company
therefore has greater predictability of earnings and cash flow. It can toler-
ate a higher level of fixed charges, implying a larger proportion of debt in its
capitalstructure,thanthemachinerymanufacturer.Theratingagenciesmay
assign Single-A ratings to a manufacturer of personal care products with a
ratio of total debt to total capital that would earn a machinery maker with
similar ratio ratings no higher than Triple-B.
For this reason, a ratio comparison between companies in different
industries can be misleading. One company can look superior based on a
particular ratio, yet still be excessively leveraged in view of the operating
risksinitsindustry.Comparabilityproblemsbecomeevenmorepronounced
when ratio analysis crosses boundaries of broadly defined sectors of the
economy (e.g., industrial, financial, utility, and transportation).

a producer of coated white paper is not comparable to a producer of kraft

Too zealous an effort to create homogeneous peer groups, though, nar-
rows the field to such an extent that ratio comparisons begin to suffer from
having too few data points. At the extreme, a comparison with only one
other peer company is not terribly informative. The company being evalu-
ated may rank above its lone peer, but the analyst does not know whether
the peer is strong or weak.

Credit Analysis 331
The first technique is to compare the company against a reasonably
homogeneousindustrypeergroup,suchasthepersonalandhouseholdprod-
ucts companies shown in Exhibit 13.6. Credit analysts can use this type of
analysis to slot a company within its industry. The ratios in the 23-company
samplecomparisonareaverages,computedoverthreeyears.Averagingmin-
imizes the impact of unrepresentative results that any company may report
in a single year.
Note that the following discussion deals withcompany credit ratings.
The rating on a particular obligation of a company will depend on its pri-
ority within the capital structure. Examples, from highest to lowest priority,
includesecuredloans,seniorunsecuredbonds,subordinatedbonds,andpre-
ferred stocks.
Standard & Poor’s conducts far more analysis in assigning the ratings
indicated in the table, but the exhibit provides some insight into how well
two basic financial ratios sort the companies by rating. (In both compar-
isons, a higher ratio indicates superior credit quality.) All companies rated
AA or A rank in the top third by free cash flow as a percentage of total debt.
Conversely, all those rated B or CCC place in the bottom half. Companies
rated in the middle range, BBB or BB, are more widely scattered.
Less efficient at sorting the companies is EBITDA/interest expense, even
though this ratio is so popular among practitioners that some regard it as
shorthand for a company’s credit quality. Ranked by EBITDA coverage, AA
andAcompaniesarefoundinboththetopandbottomhalf.EBITDAcover-
age does at least place the group’s lowest-rated issuer, CCC– Revlon, at the
very bottom of the heap.
Avon Products ranks last or next to last in these ratio comparisons
despite a mid-range rating of BB–. That seeming anomaly is explained by
financial support that has been provided by the company’s majority owner,
Natura & Co., which was rated Ba2 by Moody’s and BB by Standard &
Poor’s as of 2021. Even though Natura does not formally guarantee Avon’s
debt, the rating agencies perceived, as of this book’s going to print, that it
would continue to provide support if required. This concept of implicit sup-
port, mentioned near the beginning of this chapter, is one more example of

334 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
rating agencies add modifiers (1, 2, and 3 or+ and –) to indicate whether a
company ranks in the high, middle, or low zone within the categories from
Aa/AA to Caa/CCC.
The three formsof comparative ratioanalysis described here are helpful
in assessing the credit quality of a company not rated by any of the leading
rating agencies. Analysts can characterize a nonrated company by establish-
ing which rating category its credit file most resembles, and where it ranks
withinthat category, based on ratiocomparisons. Insuch exercises, analysts
should keep in mind the size criterion, previously discussed, for creation of
peer groups.
Comparative ratio analysis is also useful in assessing the credit impact
of a major transaction, such as a debt-financed acquisition or a major stock
repurchase. The analyst can calculate ratios based on pro forma financial
statements (see Chapter 12) and slot the company in a grid of median ratios
by rating category, as in Exhibit 13.7. In view of changes in the peer group
ratios that arise from fluctuations in business conditions, it is important to
use data as up to date as possible for the exercise.
Analysts should also bear in mind that a company can potentially avert
a downgrade implied by the pro forma ratios, provided management’s cred-
ibility with the rating agencies is high. The key is to present a plausible plan
forrestoringfinancialleveragetoitspre-transactionlevelwithinafewyears.
Note, however, that the company will merely delay the downgrade if it does
not quickly begin to make palpable progress toward the long-range target.
The rating agencies tend to be skeptical about a company’s ability to imple-
ment a three-year plan entirely in the third year.
Ratio Trend Analysis
Comparative ratio analysis is an effective technique for assessing relative
credit risk, yet it leaves the analyst exposed to a major source of error. Sup-
pose two companies in the same industry posted an identical fixed-charge
coverage of 3.5 times last year. On a ratio comparison, the two appear to be
equallyrisky.Suppose,however,thatonecompanyhadcoverageof5.0times
fiveyearsagoandhassteadilydeclinedto3.5times.Imagine,aswell,thatthe
othercompany’scoveragehasimprovedoverthesameperiodfrom2.0times
to 3.5 times. If the two companies’ trends appear likely to continue, based
on analysis of their operations, then the happenstance that both covered
their interest by 3.5 times last year should have little bearing on the credit
assessment. The company that will have stronger coverage in the future is
the better risk.
A further complication is that improving or deteriorating financial
ratioscanhavedifferentimplicationsfordifferentcompanies.Insomecases,

Credit Analysis 335
a declining trend over several years signals that a company has genuinely
fallen to a new, lower level of credit quality. For other companies, negative
year-over-year comparisons merely represent the down legs of their normal
operating cycles.
Certain industries enjoy fairly stable demand, year in and year out.
Small-ticket nondurables such as food, beverages, and beauty aids are not
items that consumers cease to buy during recessions. At worst, people
trade down to cheaper products within the same categories. In contrast,
consumers tend to postpone purchases of big-ticket durable goods when
credit is tight or when they have misgivings about the economic outlook.
Producers of automobiles, houses, and major appliances are among the
businesses that experience wide swings in demand between peaks and
troughs in the economy. Profits typically fluctuate even more dramatically
in these industries, due to the high fixed costs entailed in capital-intensive
production methods.
In evaluating the long-range creditworthiness of cyclical companies,
the rating agencies historically focused on cycle-to-cycle, rather than year-
to-year, trends. Their notion was that a cycle-to-cycle pattern of similar
highs and similar lows (Exhibit 13.9) did not imply a true impairment
of financial strength. Deterioration was indicated only when a company
displayedatrendofsuccessivelylowerhighsandlowerlows(Exhibit13.10).
The rating agencies label this traditional approach “rating through
the cycle.” Although it still influences the agencies’ analysis, they have
somewhat de-emphasized the concept over time. They are more likely than
formerly to assume that an extended upturn or downtrend in a company’s
ratios represents a longer-lived shift. The agencies must also respond to
fixed income investors’ preferences regarding the optimal time horizon
embedded in ratings.

Even in years past, when the agencies adhered more closely to the doc-

cyclical decline from more permanent deterioration, without the benefit of

Then, as now, an analyst had to look beyond the financial statements to
make an informed judgment about the likely persistence of an improvement
or deterioration in financial measures.
Looking Beyond the Ratios
In addition to looking outside the financial statements, a thorough credit
analysis requires scrutinizing the statements for items that raise questions
about quality of financial reporting. Noble Group Ltd.’s decline during
2015–2018 provides an object lesson on this point.
The Hong Kong-based commodities trading firm was the subject of a
February15,2015,reportbyIcebergResearchthathighlightedits“remark-
able ability to spot accounting loopholes.”6 Among other things, the report
criticized Noble’s accounting for related companies. For example, Noble
held a 13 percent stake in Yancoal, a listed Australian company. Asserting
that it had “significant influence” over the coal miner, a claim that Iceberg
vigorously disputed, Noble classified Yancoal as an “associate” on its bal-
ance sheet. That classification ordinarily requires equity ownership between
20 percent and 50 percent.
Noble’s dubious accounting treatment enabled it to carry its Yancoal
stake at initial cost, adjusted for subsequent gains or losses (the “equity
method”). On that basis, Noble showed the value of its holding at $614
million versus a market value of its shares of just $11 million. Noble would

Credit Analysis 337
have had to show the smaller value on its balance sheet if it had followed
standard accounting for an equity stake of less than 20 percent, namely,
classifying Yancoal as a long-term investment.
The $603 million gap between the stated value of Noble’s Yancoal
investment and the market value represented 11 percent of Noble’s stated
shareholders’ equity. Moreover, Noble had inflated the value of its Yancoal
holding, as Iceberg detailed, by not calculating its initial cost in the custom-
ary way. Instead of basing it on the price it paid for the shares, Noble put
them on its books at five times their market value, based on its cash flow
projections for Yancoal.
Iceberg’s report noted that other analysts had previously commented
on Noble’s valuation of its Yancoal stake, but went on to discuss similarly
aggressive accounting for a new associate as of the fourth quarter 2014
statements, Noble Agri Ltd. A subsequent Iceberg report contended that the
commoditytrader’streatmentofongoingoperationswasevenmoredisturb-
ing than its handling of so-called associates.
Fixed income investors would have been wise to focus on the weakness
of Noble’s financial reporting quality, which Iceberg identified by looking
beyond standard financial ratios. The company’s 6.75 percent bond due in
2020 was quoted at 101.750 at the time of February 15, 2015, report. Stan-
dard & Poor’s rated the company BBB– at the time. With its true financial
condition more precarious than its balance sheet indicated, Noble took a
beating amid falling commodity prices. By the end of 2015 its 6.75 percent
bond was down by 33 percent, to 68.50. Over the same interval, the bench-
marknowknownastheICEBofAAsianDollarInvestmentGradeIndexwas
downbyjust3percent.OnJanuary7,2016,Standard&Poor’sdowngraded
Noble to speculative grade, at BB+.
Bythen,apenetrating Wall Street Journal“HeardontheStreet”column
of July 2, 2015,
7 had highlighted the credit risk inherent in Noble’s increase
in debt of nearly $1 billion, to $4.9 billion, in the year’s first quarter. That
figure did not include the debt of associate Agri Ltd. Furthermore, wrote
journalistAbheekBhattacharya,whocitedCreditSight’sAndyDeVriesinhis
article, Noble’s leverage was understated by virtue of the company counting
as equity a $400 million perpetual bond. Granted, the permanence of this
debt capital made it somewhat equity-like, but unlike common stock divi-
dends, interest payments on bonds cannot be omitted without triggering a
default and potentially casting the borrower into bankruptcy.
Bhattacharya further pointed out that Noble faced $2.26 billion of
debt maturities through March 2016, including $500 million in the form
of five-year bonds coming due in August 2015. The choices for making
those principal redemptions were mostly unattractive. Issuing new five-year
bonds would be expensive in view of Noble’s reduced credit rating. Cheaper

interest rates were available on shorter-dated debt, but choosing that route
that would postpone a potential refinancing problem only briefly.
Atfirstblush,Noblehad$928millionofcashthatitcouldapplytodebt
redemption, but on closer examination, all but $499 million of that amount
was tied up with brokers, in futures trading or otherwise. The company
did have $3 billion in unused, committed credit facilities, but tapping
that source would sacrifice some future financial flexibility. In any case,
management appeared less concerned about reining in debt than attempting
to shore up its stock price by buying back shares, thereby further increasing
its financial leverage. Bhattacharya reported that during June 2015 Noble
had spent $69.1 million on share repurchases, through the 29th. He warned
that inattention to the balance sheet could cause creditors to desert the
company.
Noblemanagedtododgethebulletatthatpoint,butitsfinancialcondi-
tion continued to deteriorate. By the end of 2017 its 6.75 percent bond was
down to 37. Standard & Poor’s downgraded the issue to CC on January 30,
2018. On March 13, amid plans for a financial restructuring, Noble failed
to pay the coupon on a bond maturing in 2022. Over the next week the
company said it would miss interest principal and interest payments on two
other bonds and Standard & Poor’s reduced its rating to D for default.
This case history demonstrates why credit analysts must do more
with financial statements than mechanically calculate ratios. Certainly,
Noble’s financial ratios worsened as its bond prices plummeted, but
investors hope to exit securities before, not concurrently with, major losses.
Iceberg Research’s analysis, at a time when Noble’s 6.75 percent bond was
trading above par, focused not on ratios but on management’s exploitation
of accounting loopholes. Those gambits enabled the company to understate
its ratio of total debt to total capital, for example. The lesson for analysts
hoping to add value in fixed income investment is that staying abreast of a
company’s ratios is essential, but not always sufficient.
Default Risk Models
As noted, comparative ratio analysis and ratio trend analysis are techniques
for placing companies on a relative scale of credit quality. Many analysts
have no need to look more deeply into the matter, but it is impossible to
cover the topic of credit analysis satisfactorily without discussing two more
fundamental issues. First, there is the question of how to set up a ranking
scheme such as bond ratings in the first place. Second, there is the problem
of conflicting indicators. How, for example, should an analyst evaluate a
company that ranks well on fixed-charge coverage but poorly on financial

leverage? A rigorous approach demands something more scientific than an
individual analyst’s subjective opinion that coverage should be weighted
twice as heavily as leverage, or vice versa.
The solution to both of these problems lies in establishing a statistical
relationship between financial ratios and default probability. This requires,
first of all, collecting data on the default experience in a given population.
Next, statistical methods are employed to determine which financial ratios
have historically predicted defaults most reliably. Using a model derived
from the best predictors, the analyst can then rank companies on the basis
ofhowcloselytheirfinancialprofilesresembletheprofilesofcompaniesthat
defaulted.
One example of the various models that have been devised to predict
defaults is Edward I. Altman’s Z-Score model, which takes the following
form:
Z = 1.2x
1 +1.4x2 +3.3x3 +0.6x4 +1.0x5
where: x1 = Working capital/Total assets (%, e.g., 0.20, or 20%)
x2 = Retained earnings/Total assets (%)
x3 = Earnings before interest and taxes/Total assets (%)
x4 = Market value of equity/Total liabilities (%)
x5 = Sales/Total assets (number of times, e.g., 2.0 times)
Inthismodel,scoresbelow1.81signifyseriouscreditproblems,whereas
a score above 3.0 indicates a healthy firm.
A refinement of the Z-Score model, the Zeta model developed by Alt-
man and his colleagues,8 achieved greater predictive accuracy by using the
following variables:
x1 = Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)/Total assets
x2 = Standard error of estimateof EBIT/Total assets (normalized) for
10 years
x3 = EBIT/Interest charges
x4 = Retained earnings/Total assets
x5 = Current assets/Current liabilities
x6 = Five-year average market value of equity/Total capitalization
x7 = Total tangible assets, normalized
Quantitative models such as Zeta, as well as others that have been
devised using various mathematical techniques, have several distinct bene-
fits. First, they are developed by objectively correlating financial variables

with defaults. They consequently avoid guesswork in assigning relative
weights to the variables. Second, the record of quantitative models is
excellent from the standpoint of classifying as troubled credits most com-
panies that subsequently defaulted. In addition, the scores assigned to non-
defaultedcompaniesbythesemodelscorrelatefairlywellwithbondratings.
This suggests that although Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and Fitch Ratings
originally developed their rating methods along more subjective lines, their
conclusionsareatleastpartiallyvindicatedbystatisticalmeasuresofdefault
risk. Therefore, the credit analyst can feel comfortable about using methods
such as ratio trend analysis to slot companies within the ratings framework.
Onemayquarrelwiththeratingagencies’assessmentsofspecificcompanies
or industries, but there is strong statistical support for the notion that in the
aggregate, ratings provide a valid, if rough, assessment of default risk. The
lower a company’s present rating, the higher its probability of defaulting
over the next year, next two years, and so on up to 20 years.
9
Useful as they are, though, quantitative default models cannot entirely
replace human judgment in credit analysis.
For one thing, quantitative models tend to classify as troubled credits
not only most of the companies that eventually default but also many that
do not default.10 Often, firms that fall into financial peril bring in new man-
agementandarerevitalizedwithouteverfailingintheirdebtservice.Iffaced
with a huge capital loss on the bonds of a financially distressed company, an
institutional investor might wish to assess the probability of a turnaround –
an inherently difficult-to-quantify prospect – instead of selling purely on the
basis of a default model.
The credit analyst must also bear in mind that companies can default
for reasons that a model based solely on reported financial data cannot pick
up. For example, U.S. Brass entered Chapter 11 proceedings in 1994 in an
effort to resolve litigation involving defective plastic plumbing systems that
it had manufactured. Dow Corning’s 1995 bankruptcy filing offered a pos-
siblemeansofresolvingmassivelitigationthatarosefromsiliconegelbreast

company’s notes to financial statements, but default models based entirely
on financial statement data do not deal with contingent liabilities.
In the case of the Zeta model, the default hazard posed by a company’s
environmental or product liability litigation may be picked up, at least in
part, by the ratio of market value of equity to total capitalization. Stock
market investors consider such risks in determining share prices.
Some default risk models downplay statement data in favor of reliance
on the equity market’s wisdom. The best known model of this sort is mar-
keted by Moody’s KMV. BondScore, a product of CreditSights, combines
quantitativeanalysisbasedonequitypricingwithtraditionalcreditanalysis.
Underlying these approaches is the observation that a company’s debt and
equitybothderivetheirvaluefromthesameassets.Equityholdershaveonly
a residual claim after bondholders have been paid. Therefore, if the market
value of a company’s assets falls below the value of its liabilities, the stock
becomesworthless.Atthatpoint,thecompanybecomesbankrupt,itsliabil-
ities exceed its assets. Extending the logic, a declining stock price indicates
that the company is getting closer to bankruptcy. In theory, then, credit ana-
lysts can skip the financial statement work and monitor companies’ default
risk simply by watching their stock prices.
Like the quantitative models consisting of financial ratios, the default
risk models based on stock prices provide useful, but not infallible, sig-
nals. For example, when a company dramatically increases its total-debt-
to-total-capital ratio by borrowing money to repurchase stock, its default
risk clearly rises. At the same time, its stock price may also rise, reflect-
ing the positive impact on earnings per share of increased financial leverage
and a reduction in the number of shares outstanding. According to the the-
ory underlying the stock-based default risk models, however, a rising share
price indicates declining default risk. This is one of several caveats typically
accompanying credit opinions derived from stock-based models.
Even if share prices were perfect indicators of credit risk, credit analysts
would not escape the rigors of tearing apart financial statements. To begin
with, not every company’s shares trade in the public market. The produc-
ers of stock-based models attempt to get around this problem by using
share prices of industry peers to create surrogates for private companies’
unobservable equity values. This method, however, cannot capture the
sort of company-specific risks that led to the above-listed bankruptcies
that were triggered by massively costly lawsuits. Neither can stock-based
default risk models relieve the analyst of such tasks as creating pro forma
financial statements to gauge the impact of a potential merger or major
asset sale. At most, incorporating stock prices into credit analysis is a
useful complement to plumbing the financial statements for meaning with
time-tested ratio calculations.

342 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
CONCLUSION
Default risk models can provide a solid foundation for credit analysis but
must be used in conjunction with the analyst’s judgment on matters too
complex to be modeled. Much the same applies to all of the quantitative
techniques discussed in this chapter. A lender should not offer credit before
first running the numbers. By the same token, it is a mistake to rely solely
on the numbers to sidestep a difficult decision. This can take the form of
rejecting a reasonable risk by inflexibly applying quantitative criteria. Alter-
natively, it can wind up being costly to approve a credit against one’s better
judgment,whilecountingonfinancial ratiosthataretechnicallysatisfactory
as a defense against criticism if the loan goes bad.
As other chapters in this book demonstrate, financial statements are
vulnerabletomanipulation,muchofwhichisperfectlylegal.Often,thespe-
cific aim of the manipulators is to outfox credit analysts who mechanically
calculate ratios without pausing to consider whether accounting ruses have
defeated the purpose. Another danger in relying too heavily on quantitative
analysis is that a company may unexpectedly and radically alter its capital
structure to finance an acquisition or defend itself against a hostile takeover.
Such action canrender ratioanalysis oneven themostrecent financial state-
ments largely irrelevant. In the end, credit analysts must equip themselves
with all the tools described in this chapter yet not be made complacent
by them.

CHAPTER 14
Equity Analysis
C
ountless books have been written on the subject of picking stocks. The
approaches represented in their pages cover a vast range. Some focus on
technical analysis, which seeks to establish the value of a common equity
by studying its past price behavior. Others take as their starting point the
efficient market hypothesis, which in its purest form implies that no sort of
analysis can identify values not already recognized and properly discounted
by the market.
This chapter does not attempt to summarize or criticize all the methods
employed by the legions who try to outperform the market. Rather, the dis-
cussion focuses primarily on the use of financial statements infundamental
analysis. This term refers to the attempt to determine whether a company’s
stock is fairly valued, based on its financial characteristics.
Certain elements of fundamental analysis donot rely entirely, or even
primarily, on information found in the financial statements. For example,
a company may appear to be a good candidate for a bust-up, or hostile
takeover, premised on selling portions of the company to realize value not
reflected in its stock price. As discussed later in this chapter, the analyst can
estimate the firm’s ostensible breakup value by studying its annual report.
The feasibility of a hostile raid, however, may hinge on the pattern of share
ownership, the availability of financing for a takeover, or laws applicable to
tender offers. All these factors lie outside the realm of financial statement
analysis, but may have a major bearing on the valuation process.
Note as well that GAAP earnings play a central role in traditional
equity analysis, as detailed here. GAAP expenses items such as advertising
and research and development (R&D) that create enduring values in many
New Economy companies. Creating enduring value is the definition of
producing an asset, a process that GAAP validates in the case of traditional
manufacturing companies by capitalizing the expenditures on plant and
equipment that produce the enduring value. In contrast, GAAP treats as
current costs the outlays that produce (for example) long-term subscribers

immense, sustainable value that the stock market will affirm, even as GAAP
accounting shows that current costs more than fully offset the company’s
revenues. That leaves no earnings to which to apply a price-earnings mul-
tiple, as described in this chapter. Analysts following such companies may
rely on other, operationally oriented metrics to judge the appropriateness
of their stock prices.

investors, many of them sidelined from sports gambling by the COVID-19
pandemic’s curtailment of sporting events, bid up so-called meme stocks in
efforts to squeeze short-sellers who considered them overpriced. The sheer
force of collective action rendered conventional notions of intrinsic value
irrelevant, at least in the short run. We mention this phenomenon to rein-
force the point that financial statement analysis coexists with other modes
of stock selection.

THE DIVIDEND DISCOUNT MODEL
Several methods of fundamental common stock analysis have been devised
over the years, but few match the intuitive appeal of regarding the stock
priceasthediscountedvalueofexpectedfuturedividends.(See“NetPresent
Value” entry in the Glossary.) This approach is analogous to the yield-
to-maturity calculation for a bond and therefore facilitates the comparison
of different securities of a single issuer. Additionally, the method permits the
analyst to address the uncertainty inherent in forecasting a noncontractual
flow
1 by varying the applicable discount rate.
To understand the relationship between future dividends and present
stock price, consider the following fictitious example: Hemidemi Semicon-
ductor’s annual common dividend rate is currently $2.10 a share. Because
the company’s share of a nonexpanding market is neither increasing
nor decreasing, it will probably generate flat sales and earnings for the
indefinite future and continue the dividend at its current level. Hemidemi’s
long-term debt currently offers a yield of 3 percent, reflecting the company’s

credit rating and the prevailing level of interest rates. Based on the greater
uncertainty of the dividend stream relative to the contractual payments
on Hemidemi’s debt, investors demand a risk premium of four percentage
points–areturnof3percent +4percent =7percent–toownthecompany’s
common stock rather than its bonds.
The stock price that should logically be observed in the market, given
these facts, is the price at which Hemidemi’s annual $2.10 payout equates
to a 10 percent yield, or algebraically:
P= D
K
P= $2.10
0.07
P= $30.00
where: P = Current stock price
D = Current dividend rate
K = Required rate of return
Iftheanalystagreesthat7percentisanappropriatediscountrate,based
on a financial comparison between Hemidemi and other companies with
similar implicit discount rates, then any price less than $30 a share indicates
that the stock is undervalued. Alternatively, suppose the analyst concludes
that Hemidemi’s future dividend stream is less secure than the dividend
streams of other companies to which a 7 percent discount rate is being
applied. The analyst might then discount Hemidemi’s stream at a higher
rate, say 10 percent, and recalculate the appropriate share price as follows:
P= $2.10
0.10
P= $21.00
A market price of $30.00 a share would then indicate an overvaluation
of Hemidemi Semiconductor.
Dividends and Future Appreciation
When initiallyintroduced tothedividend-discount model, manyindividuals
respond by saying, “Dividends are not the only potential source of gain to
the stockholder. The share price may rise as well. Shouldn’t any evaluation
reflect the potential for appreciation?” It is in responding to this objection
thatthedividend-discountmodeldisplaysitselegancemostfully.Theanswer

is that there is no reason for the stock price to rise in the future unless the
dividend rises. In a no-growth situation such as Hemidemi Semiconductor,
the valuation will look the same five years hence (assuming no change in
interest rates and risk premiums) as today. There is consequently no funda-
mental reason for a buyer to pay more for the stock at that point. If, on the
other hand, the dividend payout rises over time (the case that immediately
follows), the stockwill be worth more in the future than it is today. The
analyst can, however, incorporate the expected dividend increases directly
into the present-value calculation to derive the current stock price, without
bothering to determine and discount back the associated future price appre-
ciation.Bythinkingthroughthelogicofthediscountingmethod,theanalyst
will find that value always comes back to dividends.
Valuing a Growing Company
No-growth companies are simple to analyze, but in practice most public
corporations strive for growth in earnings per share, which, as the ensuing
discussion demonstrates, will lead to gains for shareholders. In analyzing
growing companies, a somewhat more complex formula must be used to
equate future dividends to the present stock price:
P= D(1+g)
1
(1+K)1 + D(1+g)2
(1+K)2 +··· D(1+g)n
(1+K)n
where: P = Current stock price
D = Current dividend rate
K = Required rate of return
g = Growth rate

alentto K,willbeequal,after nperiods,tothecumulativevalueofdividends
paidoverthesameinterval,assumingthepayoutisinitiallyanamountequiv-
alent toDand increases in each period at a rate equivalent tog.
Fortunately, from the standpoint of ease of calculation, ifn, the num-
ber of periods considered, is infinite, the preceding formula reduces to the
simpler form:
P= D
K−g
In practice, this is the form ordinarily used in analysis, since compa-
nies are presumed to continue to operate as going concerns, rather than to
liquidate at some arbitrary future date.

EXHIBIT 14.1 Selected Financial Data for Wolfe Food Company
Net income available to common shareholders $45,000,000
Dividends to common shareholders $15,000,000
Common shares outstanding 10,000,000
Expected annual growth in earnings 7%
Investors’ required rate of return, given predictability of
Wolfe’s earnings
9%
Figures projected from the financial statements of the fictitious
Wolfe Food Company (Exhibit 14.1) illustrate the application of the
dividend-discount model. Observe that the company is expected to pay out
33
1∕3 percent of its earnings to shareholders in the current year:
Dividend payout ratio= Dividends to common shareholders
Net income available to common shareholders
= $15,000, 000
$45,000, 000
= 331∕3%
If Wolfe maintains a constant dividendpayout ratio, it follows that the
growth rate of dividends will equal the growth rate of earnings, which is
expected to be 6 percent annually. On a per share basis, the initial dividend
comes to $1.50:
Dividend rate = Dividends to common shareholders
Common shares outstanding
= $15,000, 000
10,000, 000
= $1.50 per share
With these numbers, the analyst can now use the valuation formula to
derive a share price of $75 for Wolfe:
P= D
K−g
P= $1.50
0.09−0.07
P= $1.50
0.02
P= $75

348 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
Theexecutionofthismodelrestsheavilyontheassumptionsunderlying
the company’s projected financial statements. To estimate the future growth
rate of earnings, the analyst must make informed judgments both about
the growth of the company’s markets and about the company’s ability to
maintain or increase its share of those markets. Furthermore, the company’s
earnings growth rate may diverge from its sales growth due to changes in its
operating margins that may or may not reflect industrywide trends.
Because of the uncertainties affecting such projections, the analyst
should apply to equity valuation the same sort of sensitivity analysis
discussed in connection with financial forecasting (see Chapter 12). For
instance, if Wolfe Foods ultimately falls short of the 7 percent growth rate
previously projected by one percentage point, then the $75 valuation will
prove in retrospect to have been $25.00 too high:
P= D
K−g
P= $1.50
0.09−0.06
P= $1.50
0.03
P= $50
Therefore,ananalystwhoseforecastofearningsgrowthhasamarginof
error of one percentage point should not put a strong buy recommendation
on Wolfe when it is trading at $60 a share. By the same token, a price of
$43, which implies a 5.5 percent growth rate, can safely be regarded as an
undervaluation, provided the other assumptions are valid.
Earnings or Cash Flow?
Intuitively appealing though it may be, relating share price to future divi-
dends through projected earnings growth does not jibe perfectly with real-
ity. In particular, highly cyclical companies do not produce steady earnings
increases year in and year out, yet the formulaP = D/K – g demands a
constant rate of growth. If, as assumed previously, the company’s dividend
payout ratio remains constant, the pattern of its dividends will plainly fail
to fit neatly into the formula.
What saves the dividend discount method from irrelevance is that com-
panies generally do not strive for a constant dividend payout ratio at all
costs. More typically, they attempt to avoid cutting the amount of the pay-
out,notwithstandingdeclinesinearnings.Forexample,acompanythataims
to pay out 25 percent of its earnings over a complete business cycle might

recordapayoutratioof15percentinapeakyearand90percentor100per-
centinatroughyear.Indeed,acompanythatrecordsnetlossesmaymaintain
its dividend at the established level, at least for a few years, resulting in a
meaningless payout ratio calculation. (If losses persist, financial prudence
will usually dictate cutting or eliminating the dividend to conserve cash.) As
a rule, a cyclical company will not increase its dividend on a regular, annual
basis. Nevertheless, the board will ordinarily endeavor to raise the payout
overthelongerterm.Inallofthesecases,the P=D/K–gformulawillwork
reasonably well as a valuation tool, with the irregular pattern of dividend
increases recognized through adjustments to the discount rate (K).
Although the dividend discount model can accommodate earnings’
cyclicality, the analyst must pay close attention to the method by which a
company finances the continuation of its dividend at the established rate.
A chronically money-losing company that borrows to pay dividends is
simply undergoing slow liquidation. (It is replacing its equity, ultimately
100percentofit,withliabilities.)Insuchcircumstances,thekeyassumption
that dividends will continue for an infinite number of periods becomes
unsustainable.
On the other hand, a cyclical company may sustain losses at the
bottom of a business cycle yet never reach the point at which its funds
from operations, net of capital expenditures required to maintain long-term
competitiveness, fail to cover the dividend. Maintaining the dividend under
these circumstances poses no financial threat. Accordingly, many analysts
argue that cash flow, rather than earnings, is the true determinant of
dividend-paying capability. By extension, they contend that projected cash
flow, rather than earnings-per-share forecasts, should be the main focus of
equity analysis.
Certainly, analysts need to be acutely conscious of changes in a
company’s cash-generating capability that are not paralleled by changes in
earnings. For example, a company may for a time maintain a given level of
profitability even though its business is becoming more capital-intensive.
Rising plant and equipment requirements might transform the company
from a self-financing entity into one that is dependent on external financing.
Return on equity (ROE), defined as Net Income divided by Shareholders’
Equity, will not reflect the change until, after several years, either the
resulting escalation in borrowing costs or the increase in the equity base
required to support a given level of operating earnings becomes material.
Furthermore, as detailed in Chapters 6 and 7, reported earnings are subject
to considerable manipulation. In fact, that is the flaw that helped to pop-
ularize the use of cash flow analysis in the first place. Cash generated from
operations, which is generally more difficult for companies to manipulate
than earnings, can legitimately be viewed as the preferred measure of future
dividend-paying capability.

350 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
Notwithstanding these arguments, earnings per share forecasts remain
the single most important focus of equity research. Stock prices often drop
sharply in response toearnings misses, that is, when companies announce
earnings lower than analysts’ consensus forecasts. Similar reactions occur
when companies lower theirearnings guidance, that is, their expectations
with respect to the next quarterly earnings announcement. Misses on con-
sensus sales expectations can also affect stock prices, but earnings continue
tooccupycenterstage.Nowadays,thenumberonwhichmarketparticipants
lavishsomuchattentionislikelytobe adjusted,ratherthanGAAPearnings.
Among the adjustments are elimination of events deemed one-time events,
by common agreement if not by GAAP. Investors should approach adjusted
(sometimes loosely referred to as “pro forma”) earnings cautiously. Many
companies promote versions of adjusted earnings designed to divert atten-
tion from inconvenient but genuine drags on their performance, often with
the cooperation of Wall Street analysts who act more like cheerleaders than
objective judges of value.
One other version of earnings employed by practitioners isEBITDA.
This measure first became popular in the analysis of speculative-grade debt
and leveraged buyouts, but it has gained some traction in equity analysis of
conventionally capitalized companies. In many cases, though, the compo-
nents of EBITDA other than net income are highly predictable over the near
term. This is particularly true of depreciation. By accurately forecasting the
more variable component, earnings, an investor can get a fairly good handle
on EBITDA as well.
To some extent, the unflagging focus on earnings probably reflects
institutional inertia. Portfolio managers measure the accuracy of brokerage
houses’ equity analysis in terms of earnings per share (EPS) forecasts.
Investment strategists use aggregate earnings per share forecasts, among
other inputs, to gauge the attractiveness of the stock market as a whole.
Analysts who lack an EPS forecast would have a hard time getting into the
discussion. Despite the entrenched position of earnings forecasts, however,
a mechanism is available for adjusting a stock evaluation when the quality
of the forecasted earnings is questionable due to aggressive accounting
practices. Investors can reduce the earnings multiple, as explained in the
following section.
THE PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO
Although the dividend discount model is an intuitively satisfying approach
to valuing a common stock, it is not the most convenient method of
comparing one stock’s value with another’s. Better suited to that task is

the price-earnings ratio, alternately known as the P/E ratio or earnings
multiple:
Price-earnings ratio = Stock price
Earnings per share
Basedonthisformula,WolfeFoodCompany(seeprecedingsection)has
a price-earnings ratio of:
Stock price= $75
Net income available to common shareholders= $45,000, 000
Common shares= 10,000, 000
Earnings per share = $45,000, 000
10,000, 000
= $4.50
Price-earnings ratio = $75
$4.50
Price-earnings ratio = 16.7X
Price-earnings ratio = $60
$3.60
= 16.7X
To understand how the price-earnings ratio may be used to compare
companies with one another, consider a competitor of Wolfe Food Com-
pany, Grubb & Chao (Exhibit 14.2). Grubb & Chao has the same expected
earnings growth rate as Wolfe (6 percent) and is assigned the same required
rate of return (9 percent). Its price-earnings ratio, however, is higher than
Wolfe’s (17.5X vs. 16.7X):
Price-earnings ratio = Stock price∕Earnings per share
Price-earnings ratio = $63∕
($54,000, 000

$3.60

Current stock price $63.00
Based on the information provided, an investor would regard Wolfe as
a better value than Grubb & Chao. This conclusion proceeds from applying
the dividend discount model to the latter’s numbers:

P=

15,000, 000
.09−.07
P= $1.20

P= $60
The price thus derived is lower than the actual price of $63.00, imply-
ing an overvaluation by the market. Observe as well that the correct price
for Grubb & Chao produces the same price-earnings ratio as calculated for
Wolfe Food Company:
Price-earnings ratio = $60
$3.60
= 16.7X
Value comparisons based on P/E ratios can go well beyond this sort
of company-to-company matchup. The analyst can rank all the companies
within an industry (Exhibit 14.3), then judge whether the variations in
price-earnings ratios appear justified, or whether certain companies seem
out of line. Note that this table ranks companies on the basis of actual

sibility that new shares will be created through conversion of outstanding

Why P/E Multiples Vary
Justifications for differences in earnings multiples derive from the variables
of the preceding valuation formulas. Consider the following two equations:
P= D
K−g and P∕E = P
EPS
where: P = Current stock price
D = Current dividend rate
K = Required rate of return
g = Growth rate
P/E = Price-earnings ratio
EPS = Current earnings per share (annual)
Substituting D/K – g, which equalsP,for theP in the other equation,
produces the following expanded form:
P∕E =
(
D
(K−g)
)
EPS
Using this expanded equation permits the analyst to see quickly that an
increase in the expected growth rate of earnings produces a premium mul-
tiple. For example, both Wolfe Food Company and Grubb & Chao have

Eatmore & Co.’s earnings will not, however, command a premium
(22.2X vs. 16.7X for its competitors) if the basis for its higher projected
growth is subject to unusually high risks. For example, Eatmore’s strategy
may emphasize expansion in developing countries, where the rate of growth
inpersonalincomeishigherthaninthemorematureeconomyoftheUnited
States. If so, Eatmore may be considerably more exposed than Wolfe or
Grubb & Chao to the risks of nationalization, new restrictions on repa-
triation of earnings, protectionist trade policies, and adverse fluctuations
in exchange rates. In that case, the market will raise its discount rate (K)
on Eatmore’s earnings. An increase of just half a percentage point (from
9.0 percent to 9.5 percent) drops Eatmore’s earnings multiple below its
competitors’ 16.7X, reducing it from 22.2X to 13.3X:

defense against earnings manipulation by management, as described in

long-term investment spending, yet expect the resulting, artificially inflated
earnings per share to be valued at the same multiple as its competitor’s
more legitimately derived profits. Indeed, the heart of many management
presentations to analysts is a table showing that the presenting company’s
multiple is low by comparison with its peers. Typically, the chief executive
officercitesthistableasproofthatthecompanyisundervalued.Thenatural
corollary is that in time investors will become aware of the discrepancy and
raise the multiple and therefore the price of shares owned by those who are
astute enough to buy in at today’s dirt-cheap level.
These stories are sometimes persuasive, yet one must wonder whether
such discrepancies in earnings multiples truly indicate inattention by ana-
lysts. In the case of a large-capitalization company, hundreds of Wall Street
andinstitutionalanalystsareprobablymakingthecomparisonontheirown.
If so, they are fully aware of the below-average multiple but consider it jus-
tified for one or more reasons, including the following:
■ The company’s earnings are more cyclical than those of its peer group.
■ The company’s earnings depend on a special tax break or other leg-
islative or regulatory preference that could be rescinded as the political
winds shift.
■ The company has historically been prone to earnings surprises, which
raise suspicions that the reported results reflect an exceptionally large
amount of earnings management.
■ Technological risk,intheformofpotentialdisruptionbynovelbusiness
models or production methods, is unusually high.
■ Management has a reputation for erratic behavior (e.g., abrupt changes
in strategy, ill-conceived acquisitions) that makes future results difficult
to forecast.
Analysts may be mistaken in these perceptions and may genuinely be
undervaluing the stock. The low multiple is a conscious judgment, however,
not a function of neglect. Even a small-capitalization company, which can
more credibly claim that its stock is underfollowed by Wall Street, may have
the multiple it deserves, notwithstanding that its competitors sport higher
P/E ratios. It is appropriate to assign an above-average discount factor to
the earnings of a company that competes against larger, better-capitalized
firms. A small company may also be disadvantaged by a lack of depth in
management and be at risk from concentration of its production in one or
two plants.
Recognizing that qualitative factors may depress their multiples, com-
panies often respond in kind, arguing that their low valuations are based on
misperceptions. For example, a company in a notoriously cyclical industry

may argue that it is an exception to the general pattern of its peer group.
Thus, a manufacturer of automotive components may claim that its earn-
ings are protected from fluctuations in new car sales by a heavy emphasis
on selling replacement parts. Regardless of whether consumers are buying
new cars, the reasoning goes, they must keep their existing vehicles in good
repair. In fact, sales of replacement parts should rise if the existing fleet ages
because fewer individuals buy new autos. Similarly, a building-materials
manufacturer may claim to be cushioned against fluctuations in housing
starts because of a strong emphasis in its product line on the remodeling
and repair markets.
Theseargumentsmaycontainakerneloftruth,butinvestorsshouldnot
accept them on faith. Instead of latching on to the concept as a justification
for immediately pronouncing the company’s multiple too low, an analyst
shouldindependentlyestablishwhetheranallegedlycountercyclicalbusiness

whether the supposed source of earnings stability is truly large enough to
offset a downturn of the magnitude that can realistically be expected in the
other areas of the company’s operations.
A good rule to remember is that a company can more easily create a
new image than it can recast its operations. Analysts should be especially
wary of companies that have tended to jump on the bandwagon of concepts
associated with the hot stocks of the moment. When the Internet began rev-
olutionizing industries in the 1990s, some relatively mundane companies
projected more exciting images by doing little more than adding “.com” to
their names. Investors were dazzled by the cost savings that could be real-
ized with the help of new information management technology, but did not
alwayspaycloseattentiontotherelativeabilityofcompaniestoretainthose
savingsratherthanbeforcedbycompetitiontopassthemalongtotheircus-
tomers. The day of reckoning arrived in March 2000, generally regarded as
the bursting of the Dotcom Bubble. By no means, however, did that put an
end to companies striving to present themselves as vehicles by which stock
investors could express a view that came into vogue. For instance, when
the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, companies that could not credibly
present a cutting-edge tech image instead sought to project themselves as
“reopening plays” positioned to benefit especially well from resumption of
normal economic activity.
Normalizing Earnings
Companies have strong incentives to obtain incremental increases in their
earnings multiples, even at the cost of stretching the facts to the break-
ing point (or beyond). Accordingly, it is prudent to maintain a conservative

Equity Analysis 359
Earnings sustainability is an issue not only in connection with unusual
surges in earnings but also when it comes to determining whether a com-
pany’s historical rate of growth in earnings per share is likely to continue.
The answer is probably no if the growth has been fueled by anything other
than additions to retained earnings per share.
Consider the following derivation of earnings per share:
Asset
turnover × Return on
sales ×Leverage× Book value
pershare = Earnings per share
Or:
Sales
Assets × Net income
Sales × Assets
Net worth× Net worth
Sharesoutstanding
= Net income
Sharesoutstanding
Earnings per share will not grow merely because sales increase. Any
such increase will be canceled out in the preceding formula, given that the
sales number appears in the denominator of return on sales as well as in
thenumeratorofassetturnover.Onlybyanincreaseinoneofthefourterms
on the left side of the equation, or by a reduction in the number of shares
outstanding, will the product (earnings per share) rise. Aggressive manage-
mentmayboostassetturnover,buteventuallytheassetswillreachthelimits
of their productive capacity. Return on sales, likewise, cannot expand indef-
initely because too-fat margins will invite new competition. Leverage also
reaches a limit because lenders will not continue advancing funds beyond
a certain point as financial risk increases. This leaves only book value per
share, which can rise unceasingly through additions to retained earnings,
as a source of sustainable growth in earnings per share. As long as the
amount of equity capital invested per share continues to rise, more income
canbeearnedonthatequity,and(asthereadercandemonstratebyworking
through the preceding formula) earnings per share can increase.
A company’s book value per share will not rise at all, however, if it
distributes 100 percent of its earnings in dividends to shareholders. (This,
by the way, is why an immediate increase in the dividend-payout ratio will
not ordinarily cause a direct, proportionate rise in the stock price, as might
appeartobetheimplicationoftheequation P=D/K–g.)Assumingthecom-
panycanearnitscustomaryreturnonequityonwhateverprofitsitreinvests
internally, raising its dividend-payout ratio reduces its growth in earnings
per share (g). Such a move proves to be self-defeating, as both the numer-
ator and the denominator (D and K – g, respectively) rise andP remains
unchanged.

360 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
To achieve sustainable growth in earnings per share, then, a company
must retain a portion of its earnings. The higher the portion retained, the
more book value is accumulated per share and the higher can be the EPS
growth rate. By this reasoning, the following formula is derived:
Sustainable growth rate=( Return on equity)×( Income reinvestment rate)
where: Income reinvestment rate = 1−Dividend payout ratio
As mentioned, the one remaining way to increase earnings per share,
after exhausting the possibilities already discussed, is to reduce the number
of shares outstanding. Stock buybacks have valid corporate finance pur-
poses. One is to prevent earnings dilution that would otherwise result from
exercise of compensation-related stock options. In addition, returning cap-
ital to investors represents a better use of corporate funds than investing in
projectsthatareunlikelytoearnthecorporation’scostofcapital.Note,too,
thatfromtheshareholder’sviewpoint,sellingstocktothecompany–ideally
at a higher price than the shareholder paid – is a more tax-efficient way of
obtaining a cash distribution than receiving a dividend that will be taxed at
ordinary income rates. More questionable is the use of a stock buyback as a
short-run fix for a sagging share price, particularly if the repurchase seems
timed to boost executive compensation that is tied to stock performance.
Between 1995 and 1999, International Business Machines spent $34.1
billion to repurchase shares, more than its $31.3 billion cumulative net
income for the period. By reducing its shareholders’ equity through stock
purchases, IBM increased its leverage and, therefore, its financial risk.
Moreover, the company intensified this effect by adding to its debt. Finan-
cial commentator James Grant quipped that if IBM continued to buy in
shares, it would undergo a slow-motion leveraged buyout.
2 This approach
to boosting EPS tends to be self-limiting, for as already noted, lenders refuse
at some point to countenance increased indebtedness.
Analysts should note one subtlety in calculating the impact of stock
repurchases on earnings per share. To the extent that the company funds
the buybacks with idle cash, the increase in EPS is reduced by the amount of
income formerly earned by parking the cash in short-term debt instruments.
Ifa company has far more cash on itsbalance sheet than it can employ prof-
itably in its operations, management cannot truly be accused of artificially
inflating its per share income by buying in stock.
THE DU PONT FORMULA
The preceding discussion of sustainable growth introduced a formula that
provided insight into earnings per share by disaggregating it into several
simple financial ratios. Disaggregation can be applied in other beneficial

ways in equity analysis, most notably in a technique known as the Du
Pont Formula. (The idea is generally credited to Donaldson Brown, who
developed the formula while at E. I. du Pont de Nemours, then applied
it during the 1920s as vice president of finance at General Motors.) With
the aid of the Du Pont Formula, the analyst can more readily perceive the
sources of a firm’s return on assets:
Asset turnover×Returnonsales = Returnonassets
Sales
Assets × Income
Sales = Income
Assets
This analysis can be expanded to ascertain the contribution of financial
leverage to return on equity:
Asset turnover×Return on sales×Financial Leverage= Return on Equity
Sales
Assets × Income
Sales × Assets
Equity = Income
Equity
Note that “financial leverage” is not directly defined as a ratio of debt
to assets or equity, as in most other contexts. Rather, it is the ratio of assets
to equity. By definition, the excess of assets over equity consists of liabilities,
not limited to debt. Conceptually, this version of financial leverage indicates
how large an asset base is supported by the company’s equity.
Like most ratio analysis, the Du Pont Formula is valuable not only for
the questions it answers but also for the new ones it raises. If a company
increasesitsreturnonassetsbyfindingwaystoreduceworkingcapitalwith-
out impairing competitiveness (thereby improving asset turnover), then it is
likely to be able to perform at the higher level. On the other hand, cutting
back on necessary capital expenditures will also have a positive effect – in

as much leverage (11.92 times versus 2.81 times).
Also noteworthy in Exhibit 14.7 is Hershey’s extraordinarily high
return on equity (66.11 percent). This ROE outlier results from the com-
pany’s very low book value. Producers of branded food products typically
derive their equity value primarily from consumer acceptance of their
well-known brands, rather than the physical plants in which they produce
their goods. Under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the
costs of these companies’ product development and advertising, which
create enduring value just as a factory or an oil well does, are expensed
rather than capitalized. Unlike the accounting system, the financial markets
recognize the economic value of brand names. Exhibit 14.8 shows that
Hershey’s book value is a mere 5.6 percent of its market value. The median
market-to-book ratio within the group depicted is 3.86 times, underscoring
how little investors regard accounting-based net worth as a measure of a
company’s economic value.

VALUATION THROUGH RESTRUCTURING POTENTIAL
A subtler benefit of the Du Pont analysis is the insight it can provide into
companies’ potential for enhancing value through corporate restructuring.
Whether initiated internally or imposed from outside, major revisions in
operating and financial strategies can dramatically increase the price of a
corporation’s common shares. The analysis illustrated in Exhibit 14.7 helps
toidentifythetypeofrestructuringthatcanunlockhiddenvalueinapartic-
ular instance. Some companies have the potential to raise their share prices
by utilizing their assets more efficiently, whereas others can increase their
value by increasing their financial leverage.

By way of background, corporate managers frequently find themselves
at odds with stock market investors and speculators over issues of corpo-
rate policy. In general, managers prefer to maintain a certain amount of
slackintheirorganizations,thatis,areservecapacitytodealwithcrisesand

generate excess cash that remains on the balance sheet earning the modest
returns available on low-risk, short-dated financial instruments. That cash
may come in handy, they argue, if earnings and cash flow unexpectedly turn
down or if an outstanding acquisition opportunity suddenly presents itself.
Investors and speculators, in contrast, prefer to see the cash used to repur-
chasestockorreturnedtoshareholdersviadividends.Managersalsotendto
be more inclined than many shareholders are to believe that underperform-
ing units can be rehabilitated. Their judgment is sometimes influenced by
reluctance to admit that acquisitions in which they had a hand have worked
out poorly.
Over the years, management–shareholder disputes over such operating-
and financial-policy issues have featured a variety of tactics. As far back
as 1927–1928, pioneer securities analyst Benjamin Graham waged a
successful campaign to persuade the management of Northern Pipeline
to liquidate certain assets that were not essential to the company’s crude
oil transportation business and distribute the proceeds to shareholders.
Graham enlisted pivotal support for his effort from a major institutional
holder, the Rockefeller Foundation. The outcome was unusual; both at
the time and for many years afterward institutional investors generally
sided with management. At most, institutions sold their shares if they
became thoroughly dissatisfied with the way a company was being run.

Trying to use their stock ownership to spur change was not a widespread
institutional practice. Therefore, management’s main adversaries in battles
over corporate governance were aggressive financial operators. During the
1950s, these swashbucklers attracted considerable attention by pushing for
strategic redirection through proxy battles. Their modus operandi consisted
of striving to obtain majority control of the board through the election of
directors at the annual meeting of shareholders.
The 1970s brought a tactical shift to hostile takeovers, a type of
transaction previously regarded as unsavory by the investment banks that
acted as intermediaries in mergers and acquisitions. Hostile takeovers
became especially prominent in the 1980s, fueled in part by the greatly
increased availability of high-yield debt (informally referred to as junk
bond)financing.High-yieldbondsalsofinancedscoresofleveragedbuyouts
(LBOs), whose sponsors defended these controversial transactions in part
by arguing that corporations could improve their long-run performance
if they were taken private and thereby shielded from the public market’s
insatiable demand for short-run profit increases.
In the 1990s, institutional investors finally began to understand the
influence they could wield in corporate boardrooms by virtue of their vast
share holdings. Large institutional shareholders began to prod corporations
to increase their share prices by such measures as streamlining operations,
divesting unprofitable units, and using excess cash to repurchase shares.
In some instances, where merely making their collective voice heard had
no discernible effect, the institutions precipitated the ouster of senior
management.
The shareholder activism of the 1990s flourished in an environment of
comparatively high price-earnings ratios. Additionally, the period was char-
acterizedbyabacklashagainstthepreviousdecade’strendtowardincreased
financial leverage. Conditions were not conducive to the sort of borrow-
and-acquire transactions that drove much of the corporate restructurings of
the 1980s.
Leveraged buyouts did not disappear, however. After the early-1990s
wave of LBO bankruptcies, the buyout firms resumed their deal making.
Under the banner of private equity, the LBO shops gained new prominence
in the 2000s. It seemed clear that this category of alternative investments
(those outside the traditional categories of public equities, bonds, and
cash) had become a standard feature of the financial markets. A recurring
boom-and-bust cycle in LBOs also appeared to have gotten ingrained into
the investment landscape.
The prototypical leveraged buyout consists of gaining control of a com-
pany by buying its stock at a depressed price, then adding a large amount
of debt to the capital structure. In the initial stage of the cycle, opportunities

ofthissortareabundant,becauseinstitutionalinvestorsarerecoveringfrom
the previous bust. Absent the pressure of too many dollars chasing too few
deals, it is feasible to extract value without creating undue bankruptcy risk,
simply by increasing the ratio of debt to equity. The private equity firms
emphasize the second factor in the modified Du Pont Formula – financial
leverage.
In assessing a company’s potential as a leveraged buyout candidate, pri-
vate equity firms do not focus on traditional equity valuation techniques.
Consider the fictitious Sitting Duck Corporation (Exhibit 14.9). Under con-
ventional assumptions and given a prevailing earnings multiple of 17 on
similar companies, Sitting Duck’s equity will be valued at $1.122 billion,
2.2 times its book value of $502 million.
Leveraged buyout sponsors, however, would approach the valuation
much differently. Their focus would not be on earnings, but on cash flow.
After paying out approximately one-third of its earnings in dividends and
more than offsetting depreciation through new expenditures for plant
and equipment, Sitting Duck generated $31 million of cash in 2020.

conservative (28 percent) year-end 2019 total-debt-to-total-capital ratio4
and to add to the company’s existing portfolio of marketable securities. To
a buyout specialist, a more appropriate use of cash flow than reducing the
total-debt-to-total-capital ratio to 25 percent would be to make it the basis
for a takeover bid at the premium to Sitting Duck’s prevailing stock price.
The arithmetic goes as follows: Assume lenders and bond buyers
are currently willing to finance sound leveraged buyout projects that can
demonstrate EBITDA coverage of 3.0 times. (The debt providers do not
care about the company’s book profits, but rather about its ability to repay
debt. Cash generation is a key determinant of that ability.) Sitting Duck’s
operating income of $89 million, with $38 million of depreciation added
back, produces EBITDA of $127 million. The amount of interest that
$127 million can cover by 3.0 times is $42 million, an increase of $37 mil-
lion over Sitting Duck’s present $5 million interest expense. Assuming a
blendedborrowingcostof6percentontheLBOfinancing,araidercanload
$700 million onto Sitting Duck, up from the present $167 million balance.
(This example assumes that change-of-control covenants in Sitting Duck’s
existing debt require it to be redeemed in conjunction with the LBO.) If
prevailing lending standards require equity of 50 percent in the transaction,
the raider must put up an additional $700 million, for a total capitalization
of $1.400 billion. By this arithmetic, the takeover artist can pay a premium
of 25 percent ($1.400 billion÷ $1.122 billion= 1.25) over Sitting Duck’s
present market capitalization. The purchase price equates to a multiple
of 21 times earnings, rather than the 17 times figure currently assigned
by the market. The LBO sponsor got to this number, however, through a
measure of cash flow, rather than earnings. The EBITDA multiple of the
bid is 11 times, close to the average level paid in large LBOs in 2020, as
reported by S&P Global Markets Intelligence.
5 (As explained in Chapter 8,
EBITDA is by no means thebest measure of cash flow, but it can be fairly
described as the standard in leveraged finance circles.)
Note that Sitting Duck’s enlarged debt load greatly increases its credit
risk.PriortotheLBO,itsEBITDAcoveredinterestexpenseby25.4times.By
that ratio, the company would have fit the profile of a company rated AA,
according to data presented in Exhibit 13.7 of the preceding chapter. The

Stepping back from these calculations, one is bound to wonder whether
the LBO sponsor can truly expect to earn a high return on investment
after paying 25 percent above the prevailing price for Sitting Duck’s shares.
Many such transactions do prove highly profitable, with the new owners
eventually exiting through sale of the company or aninitial public offering,
that is, returning the company to the public market. In some cases, the
buyout sponsor takes out substantial dividends before exiting, adding to

its profits. Although private equity firms downplay the role of timing in
their success, buying companies when equity market valuations are low
and selling when they are high is a winning formula. The only problem is
that peaks in LBO activity – and EBITDA multiples – tend to be followed
by recessions and bear markets in stocks. Late-cycle deals consequently
become plagued by depressed earnings, making it difficult to cover the
company’s vastly increased interest charges at a time when exiting through
an IPO is not feasible.
Rather than rely entirely on their ability to catch the highs and lows in
the equity market, private equity firms try to enhance their probability of
success by the following means:
1. Profit Margin Improvement. A leveraged buyout can bring about
improved profitability for either of two reasons. First, a change in own-
ership resultsina freshlook at thecompany’s operations. The incoming
managers may revise the company’s model in a profit-enhancing way or
institute best practices that increase operational efficiency. In addition,
the newcomers may have less sentimental attachment to venerable
product lines that no longer achieve hurdle rates of return. They can
also more easily implement emotionally difficult steps to enhance
profit margins, such as reducing the work force and outsourcing
production. Second, management may obtain a significantly enlarged
stake in the firm’s success as the result of a buyout. With more skin
in the game, managers may become less concerned about maintaining
slack in their operations and more eager to squeeze every possible
dollar of profit out of their company’s assets. With an enhanced
opportunity to participate in the benefits, managers may crack down
on unnecessary costs that they formerly tolerated in the name of
maintaining cordial relations with employees and suppliers. They may
also pursue high-risk/high-potential-return projects more aggressively
than in the past, particularly since much of the risk has been shifted to
lenders. Regardless of how it comes about, however, improvement in
profit margins means higher EBITDA. That, in turn, leads to a higher
valuation and generates a profit for the LBO’s equity investors.
Analysts must watch out, however, for improvements in reported
profit margins that represent nothing more than reduced investment
in the company’s fitness for the long run. Following an LBO, a com-
pany can report an immediate improvement in earnings by cutting
back expenditures on advertising and research and development.
Even though the accounting rules do not permit these outlays to be
capitalized, they create benefits in future periods. Sharply reducing
such expenditures, or delaying essential capital projects to conserve

cash, can impair a company’s future competitiveness, rendering the
increase in current-period earnings illusory. Today’s profit improvement
can be a precursor of tomorrow’s bankruptcy by a company that has
economized its way to an uncompetitive state.
Regrettably, the income statement may provide too little detail to
determine whether specific kinds of investment spending have been
curtailed. Analysts must therefore query industry sources for evidence
regarding the adequacy of the company’s reinvestment in its business.
If the company’s customers report a drop in the quality of service
following a leveraged buyout, it may indicate that important sales
support functions have been eviscerated. Earnings may rise in the short
run but soon begin to suffer as customers switch to other providers.
2. Asset Sales. As a function of the stock market’s primary focus on earn-
ings, a company’s market capitalization may be far less than the aggre-
gate value of its assets. For example, a subsidiary that contributes little
to net income but generates substantial cash flow from depreciation
has a potentially large value in the private market. In that realm, the
unit would be priced on a multiple of EBITDA. Alternatively, a sub-
sidiary might be unprofitable only because its scale is insufficient. A
competitor might be willing to buy the unit and consolidate it with its
ownoperations.Theresultwouldbehighercombinedearningsthanthe
two operations were able to generate independently. An LBO sponsor
who spies this sort of opportunity within a company may invest a small
amount of equity and borrow the greater part of the purchase price,
then liquidate the low-net-income operations to repay the borrowings.
If carried out as planned, the asset sales will leave the acquirer debt-free
and in possession of the remainder of the company, that is, the oper-
ations that previously contributed almost all of the net income. In the
P/E-multiple-orientedstockmarket,thatportionofthecompanywillbe
worth as much as the entire company was previously. The LBO sponsor

has settled, the sponsor should have cleared more than enough to cover
the premium paid to original shareholders who sold into the buyout.
Unrealized earnings potential and EBITDA multiples are by no
means the only valuation factors that come into play in corporate
governance controversies. Proponents of policy changes in pursuit of
enhanced shareholder value sometimes focus on the values of specific
assets identified in the financial statements. For example, oil companies
disclose the size of their reserves in their annual reports. Because energy
companies frequently buy and sell reserves, and because the prices
of larger transactions are widely reported, current market valuations
are always readily at hand. If recent sales of reserves in the ground

have occurred at prices that equate to $60 a barrel, then a company
with 50 million barrels of reserves could theoretically liquidate those
assets for $3 billion.6 It may be that the sum of $3 billion and a
P/E-multiple-based price for the company’s refining, marketing, and
transportation assets substantially exceeds the company’s current
market capitalization. If so, the so-called unrecognized value of the oil
reserves can be the basis of an alternative method of evaluating the
company’s stock.
Would-be corporate restructurers also seek unrecognized value in
othertypesofminerals,realestate,andlong-terminvestmentsunrelated
to a company’s core business. Methods of realizing the value of such an
asset include:
■ Selling the asset for cash.
■ Placing it in a separate subsidiary, then taking a portion of the sub-
sidiary public to establish a market value for the company’s residual
interest.
■ Placing the asset in a master limited partnership, interests in which
are distributed to shareholders.
The key message to take away from this overview of- valuation
via restructuring potential is that a focus on price-earnings multiples,
the best-known form of fundamental analysis, is not the investor’s sole
alternative to relying on technicians’ stock charts. There are in fact several
approaches to fundamental analysis. A solid understanding of financial
statements is essential to all of them, even though factors outside the
financial statements also play a role in fundamental valuation.
ADVANCED EQUITY ANAL YSIS
Using financial statements to value stocks is a vast topic that extends well
beyondthebasicconcepts presentedinthischapter.Numerouspractitioners
have developed sophisticated techniques to address such issues as the grow-
ing disconnect between companies’ book values and the economic values of
their net assets. Just a sampling of advanced approaches to equity analy-
sis follows. The Bibliography provides references for further reading on the
subject.
Credit Suisse’s HOLT team argues that return on equity (ROE) is an
unreliable measure of profitability, on several grounds. For one thing, as
explained previously, companies are required under GAAP to write off
expenditures on such items as marketing, research, and web services, rather
than capitalize them as intangible assets. This is despite the fact that in

today’s economy, these outlays create enduring, quantifiable economic
value no less than manufacturing companies’ expenditures on factory
construction. A New Economy company may consequently record an
ROE below the going cost of equity capital for other, similar companies.
According to traditional financial theory, that means its stock should trade
at a discount to its book value per share. In reality, one routinely observes
shares of such companies priced at substantial premiums to book value.
This does not indicate that investors have mispriced a stock, but rather that
they recognize value creation that GAAP dismisses.
A further shortcoming of ROE is its sensitivity tofinancial leverage.
A debt-free company with ROE greater than its after-tax cost of debt can
increaseitsROEbyaddingdebttoitscapitalstructure.Addingdebtandthe
associatedinterestexpense,however,increasesthecompany’sfixedcostsand
therefore the volatility of its earnings. Investors assign less value to highly
volatile earnings than to more stable earnings. In the marketplace, a given
level of ROE achieved through aggressive leverage is not considered equiva-
lent to the same level of ROE achieved with a low debt-to-capital ratio.
A way to bring equity analysis into line with market realities, while also
improvingcomparabilityamongcompanies,istodeemphasizeROEinfavor
of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):

Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT).

fected by use of leverage. It has a weakness, however, in being influenced
by the age of the company’s assets. A company can boost its ROIC just by
spending too little to keep its plant and equipment up to date.

372 FORECASTS AND SECURITY ANALYSIS
Turning to another departure from classic equity analysis, an influen-
tial 2020 article7 by Baruch Lev and Anup Srivastava documented a decline
over time in the success ofvalue investing based on picking stocks with
low market-to-book ratios. The two finance professors linked that decline
to growing corporate investment in intangibles such as R&D, information
technology, brand development, and human resources. Under GAAP, these
investments are expensed, rather than capitalized. Therefore, they do not
become part of companies’ book value, unlike investment in tangibles such
as plant and equipment. In economic terms, Lev and Srivastava contended,
companies’ book values became widely understated.
Up until the 1980s, tangibles such as plant and equipment dominated
U.S. corporations’ investment outlays. By the time Lev and Srivastava con-
ducted their research, investment in intangibles were running twice the level
of investment in tangibles. Equity investors in aggregate ascribed value to
the intangibles that were absent from balance sheets, with the result that
companies’ market-to-book ratios rose relative to ratios observed in previ-
ous decades. Value investors who clung to stock selection criteria of earlier
times avoided the shares of many companies that were doing an excellent
jobofcreatingbonafideeconomicvalue.Inaggregate,consequently,money
managers specializing in value investing lost the performance edge that their
financial formulas had previously generated.
LevandSrivastavaaskedwhetherthevalueinvestingstrategywouldfare
better if market-to-book ratios were calculated by capitalizing the invest-
mentsinintangiblesthatGAAPrequiredcompaniestowriteoffasincurred.
Building on accounting methods developed in previous research, they
capitalized companies’ R&D expenditures, as well as a portion of selling,
general, and administrative expense associated with such items as brands,
information technology, business processes, and human resources. The
authors then ranked companies by market-to-book ratio.
Next, they tested a value-style strategy of buying the bottom-ranked 30
percent (“value stocks”) and shorting the top-ranked 30 percent (“glamour
stocks”), first based on conventional GAAP accounting and then based on
their revised book values. Many stocks assigned to the glamour category by

the study’s observation period, a value investing strategy based on bringing
GAAP-discarded intangibles onto the balance sheet beat the strategy based
on conventional accounting. The disparities widened after the 1970s, as

between data reported in financial statements and the values assigned by the
market.
The HOLT and Lev–Srivastava analyses cannot be replicated as eas-
ily as the ratios described earlier in this chapter can be calculated. Those
approachesdo,however,pointinhelpfuldirectionsforequityinvestorshop-
ing to prosper through rigorous financial statement analysis. While willing
to venture outside the GAAP framework, HOLT and Lev–Srivastava do not

other paths on the frontier of equity research are well worth exploration by
analysts who have mastered the core principles presented in this chapter.
CONCLUSION
Asnotedattheoutsetofthischapter,valuationsderivedfromfinancialstate-
mentsrepresentonlyaportionoftheanalysesbeingconductedbymillionsof
stockbuyersandsellersduringeachtradingsession.Indeed,thesplit-second
decision-making of traders on the exchange floors can scarcely be described
as analysis of any kind. Rather, it amounts to a highly intuitive response to
momentary shifts in the balance of supply and demand.
For the investor who takes a longer view, however, financial statement
analysis provides an invaluable reference point for valuation. A stock may
temporarily soar or plummet in frenzied reaction to a development of lit-
tle ultimate consequence. Eventually, however, rationality usually reasserts
itself. The share price then returns to a level that is justifiable on the basis
of the company’s long-range capacity to generate earnings and cash. Focus-
ing not only on P/E, EBITDA, and market-to-book multiples, but also on
breakupvalues,isconsistentwiththisthesis.Equityanalystscandelvemore
deeply into valuation by exploring refined techniques that improve compa-
nies’ comparability and capture value creation unrecognized by GAAP. By

to portray their financial positions in as favorable a light as possible, when try-
ing to borrow or to demonstrate their financial viability to providers of grants.
On the other hand, nonprofits sometimes strive to make themselves appear less
flush than they really are, to impress on donors the urgency of their appeal for
funds. Governmental units sometimes resort to disingenuous reporting to avoid
political fallout from the consequences of unsound fiscal policies. Anti-capitalist
ideologues cannot truthfully contend that the profit motive alone leads to devi-
ous financial reporting.

7. In financial statements prepared for tax purposes, the corporation minimizes its
taxable income by writing off fixed assets over the shortest allowable period.
This is both a lawful and a customary practice. Companies are permitted to
prepare separate sets of accounts for tax and financial reporting purposes. In
the latter, they can make choices on discretionary accounting items that result
in lower profits than shown in the former.

CHAPTER 12 Forecasting Financial Statements
1. A less restrictive type of covenant merely prohibits incurrence of new debt or
payment of dividends that would cause financial measures to deteriorate below
a targeted level. No violation occurs if, for example, net worth declines as a
result of operating losses.
2. Charley Grant, “Heard on the Street: CVS Deal Debate Isn’t Over,”WallStreet
Journal,February 12, 2020.
3. Stan Manoukian, “Hertz Corporation Research Update,” Independent Credit
Research LLC, April 27, 2020.
CHAPTER 13 Credit Analysis
1. In practice, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code encourages companies to reorganize,
rather than simply liquidate, if they become insolvent. Typically, a reorganiza-
tion results in settlement of creditors’ claims via distribution of securities of a
firm that has been rehabilitated through forgiveness of a portion of its debt.
Determination of the value of securities awarded to each class of creditor is
related to asset protection, however, so the analysis that follows applies equally
to reorganization and liquidation.
2. The comments on preferred stock in this paragraph also apply generally to pref-
erence stock, which is similar to preferred stock in form but junior to it in the
capital structure.
3. In this and subsequent definitions of total capital, minority interest is included.
This item should be viewed as equity in leverage calculations because it involves
no contractual payment and ranks junior to debt.

ries Hang over O&Y,”The Independent,May 10, 1992, Business on Sunday
Section, 1.
5. Technically speaking, the effective tax rate is somewhat manageable, even
though the statutory rate is not. It is nevertheless useful to calculate the
operating margin separately from the pretax margin, to measure management’s
operating prowess separately from its financial acumen.

from 0.00% for issuers rate Aaa to 34.52% for issuers rated Ca or C.

10. Altman, Haldeman, and Narayanan set the Zeta model’s cutoff score (the level
at which a loan request is rejected on grounds of excessive default risk) with
an explicit goal of achieving the optimal trade-off between the costs of making
loans that default and rejecting loans that do not default.
11. Christopher M. McHugh, ed., The 2000 Bankruptcy Yearbook & Almanac
(Boston: New Generation Research, 2000), 187–190.
CHAPTER 14 Equity Analysis
1. Dividends, unlike interest payments on debt, are payable at the discretion of the
board of directors, rather than in fulfillment of a contractual obligation. They
are consequently subject to greater variability – through reduction, increase, or
suspension – than bond coupons or scheduled principal repayments.
2. Bethany McLean, “Hocus-Pocus: How IBM Grew 27 percent a Year,”Fortune,
June 26, 2000, 165.
3. The notion that a company can increase its market capitalization by boosting
its financial leverage appears to fly in the face of a fundamental tenet of mod-
ern finance. Nobel economics laureates Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller
demonstratedthatundercertaincriticalassumptions,acompany’sstockmarket
value was insensitive to the proportions of debt and equity in its capital struc-
ture. Modigliani and Miller followed up on this pioneering work, however, by
exploring what happened when the assumptions were relaxed to reflect real-
world conditions. In particular, they and subsequent researchers found that the
company’s stock market value could in fact rise as a result of boosting financial
leverage to take fuller advantage of the tax shield provided by debt. Interest on
borrowings is a tax-deductible expense, whereas dividends on stock are not.
4. To back out the 2019 year-end debt ratio, add back to the year-end 2020
long-term debt of $167 million the $14 million paid down in 2020. Reduce
the year-end 2020 shareholders’ equity of $502 million by the $44 million
($66 million net income minus $22 million of dividends) increase during 2020.
Year-end 2019 long-term debt of $181 million thus equals 28 percent of $181
million plus $458 million, or $639 million.

greater than one.
book value The amount at which an asset is carried on the balance sheet. Book
value consists of the asset’s construction or acquisition cost, less depreciation

cash conversion cycle (CCC) A measurement of the number of days required to
convert working capital items (inventory, receivables, and payables) into cash.
Its calculation, as formulated by Investopedia, is:
CCC = DIO+DSO–DPO
where: DIO = Days of inventory outstanding
DSO = Days sales outstanding
DPO = Days payables outstanding
The components of CCC are calculated as follows:
DIO =( Average inventory∕Cost of goods sold)× 365days

dilution A reduction in present shareholders’ proportional claim on earnings.
Dilution can occur through the issuance of new shares in an acquisition if the
earnings generated by the acquired assets are insufficient to maintain the level
of earnings per share previously recorded by the acquiring company. Existing
shareholders’ interest is likewise diluted if the company issues new stock at
a price below book value. In this circumstance, a dollar invested by a new
shareholder purchases a larger percentage of the company than is represented
by a dollar of net worth held by an old shareholder.
discount rate The interest rate used to equate future value (see) with present value
(see). Also referred to as cost of capital (see).
discounted cash flow A technique for equating future cash flows to a present sum
of money, based on an assumed interest rate. For example, $100 compounded
annually at 8 percent over three years will cumulate to a sum of $125.97, ignor-
ing the effect of taxes. This figure can be calculated via the equation
P×(l+r)
n = F
where: P = Principal value at beginning of period (Present value)
r = Interest rate
n = Number of periods
F = Principal value at end of period (Future value)
In this case, $100 × (1.08)3 = $125.97. (Note that this formula implicitly
assumes reinvestment of cash interest received at the original rate of interest
throughout the period.)
If $125.97 three years hence is equivalent to $100 today – given the assumed
discount rate (see) of 8 percent per annum – then the ratio $100.00/$125.97,
or 0.794, can be used to determine the present value (see) of any other amount
discounted back from the same date and at the same rate.
By using the same general formula, it is possible to assign a value to an asset,
based on a series of cash flows it is expected to generate. By way of illustration,
suppose the right to distribute a particular product is expected to generate cash
flowof$5,000ayearforfouryears,thenexpire,leavingnoterminalvalue.Ata
discount rate of 15 percent, the distribution rights would be valued at $14,820,

2 $5,000 .756 $3,780

Note, however, that leverage works in reverse as well. In the following
scenario, operating income turns negative (to−$5.0 million) at both compa-
nies. With no interest expense, the unleveraged company manages to net−$3.9
million for a−2.6 percent return on equity. The leveraged company, obliged
to pay out $2.0 million in interest while operating at a loss, suffers a sharper
decline in return on equity (to −5.5 percent). Incurring financial leverage
increases the risk to equity holders, whose returns become more subject to
fluctuations. The greater the percentage of the capital structure that consists of
debt, the greater the potential for such fluctuations.

without trailing off in the latter years as Project B is projected to do. Residual
value in year 10 is likewise superior in Project A. Even so, Project B is the more
profitable investment, based on a higher net present value ($17.7 million versus

or loss for the period for such reasons as delayed recognition of items affecting
income, changes in accounting practices, and discrepancies between accruals
and actual changes in asset values.
Disparities between reported and economic earnings can also arise from
certain nuances of inventory accounting. For example, under the last-in,
first-out (LIFO) method, a company’s inventory account may include the
historical acquisition costs of goods purchased several years earlier and
unaffected (for book purposes) by inflation in the interim period. To the extent
that a surge in sales causes a company to recognize the liquidation of older
inventories during the current period, revenues will reflect postinflation (i.e.,
higher) values, but expenses will not. The mismatch will produce unusually
wide reported profit margins in the current period, even though the nominal

sensitivity analysis The testing of what-if scenarios in financial statement analysis.
Typically, sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact (on earnings, cash
flow, etc.) of a change of a stated amount in another variable (sales, profit mar-
gins, etc.). In connection with financial forecasting, sensitivity analysis may be
used to gauge the variation in projected figures that will occur if a particular
assumption proves either too optimistic or too pessimistic by a given amount.

in a shutdown of the primary trading floor because of a natural disaster or civil
disturbance.
standard error of estimate A measure of the scatter of the observations in a regres-

to the standard deviation of the vertical deviations from the least-squares line.
statutory tax rate The percentage of pretax income that would be recorded as
income tax if all of a company’s reported income were subject to the corporate
tax rate specified by federal law. Disparities between the statutory rate and the
effective rate (that which is actually recorded) arise from such reasons as tax
credits and differences between U.S. and foreign tax rates.

on the original acquisition cost. In these circumstances, accelerated methods of
depreciation, which result in larger amounts being written off in earlier than in
later years, represent more conservative reporting of expenses.
subordinated debt Borrowings that have a lesser preference in liquidation vis-à-vis
senior debt. In the event of a bankruptcy, subordinated lenders’ claims cannot
be provided for until senior claims have been satisfied.
synergy An increase in profitability arising from a merger or acquisition, relative
to the stand-alone profitability of the companies involved. Synergy may result
from economies of scale (see) or economies of scope (see).
technical default A default on debt that does not involve failure to make a sched-
uled payment of principal or interest but instead results from the violation of
a covenant requirement, such as maintaining a minimum ratio of earnings to
interest expense.

a company or the equity market as a whole. Popularized by economist James
Tobin. Also known as the Q Ratio.
total enterprise value The value that a business would fetch if put up for sale, com-
monly estimated as a multiple of its sales, earnings, or EBITDA (see). (See also
marketcapitalization.)
value investing An investment strategy consisting of selecting stocks perceived to
be trading below their intrinsic value. Underlying this approach is a belief that
the stock market frequently overreacts to both good and bad news, causing
long-term not to be reflected in companies’ share prices.
variable costs Costs that increase as the volume of production rises. Examples
include materials, fuel, power, and wages.
