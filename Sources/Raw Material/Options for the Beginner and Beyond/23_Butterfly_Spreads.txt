BUTTERFLY SPREADS
T he butterfly spread trade is typically a cheap trade with low risk
and lots ofleverage.The drawback ofthe butterfly trade is that it
focuses on a narrow range of profitability. The trade can be
arranged to have a wider profit range,but then it becomes considerably
more expensive.
These spreads can be used in various ways.The most common strategy
utilizes a butterfly trade to target a strike price toward which a stock or
index is trending.They can also be traded with adjustments,although
this usually adds additional risk to the trade. Another version of the
butterfly has an unbalanced form,so as to favor price movement in one
direction.
Standard Butterfly Trade
Let’s consider an example of the standard butterfly trade:
■ Example 1.In early July,XYZ stock is trading at $30 per share.
Your feeling is that over the next four to five months,this stock
is going to move sideways.To focus on the $30 price with
plenty of leverage,you initiate the following butterfly trade.
Trade:
Buy 1 Nov 25 call for $6.30 per share.Cost = 6.30 ×100 = $630.
Sell 2 Nov 30 calls for $2.80 per share.Credit = 2.75 ×200 = $560.
Buy 1 Nov 35 call for $.60 per share.Cost = .60 ×100 = $60.
Net cost = $130 [630 + 60 – 560 = 130].
Max risk = $130.

See Figure 23-1 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
The butterfly trade derives its name from the appearance of its risk
graph.This is best seen ifthe risk graph ofFigure 23-1 is rotated clock-
wise through ninety degrees.Then the body of the butterfly lies in the
V between $25 and $35. The top edges of the V are connected to the
wings ofthe butterfly as represented by the straight portions ofthe risk
graph that extend out from $25 and $35.
Another interpretation of this butterfly trade is a combination of a
Nov 25 through Nov 30 bull call spread and a Nov 30 through
Nov 35 bear call spread. The bull call spread has a net debit of $350
[630 – 280 = 350], whereas the bear call spread creates a net credit of
$220 [280 – 60 = 220]. The combination then has a net cost of $130
[350 – 220 = 130].

Figure 23-1

As seen in Figure 23-1, the maximum return on the butterfly spread
occurs if XYZ closes at exactly $30 on the November option’s expira-
tion date. In that case, the Nov 25 call can be sold for $500, while the
other options all expire worthless. Thus, the net profit on the trade is
$370 [500 – 130 = 370],which represents a 285 percent return on the
initial investment. Options traders often refer to the price that maxi-
mizes the return from the butterfly spread as the sweet spot.
IfXYZ closes below $30 at expiration,the net profit will be less because
the Nov 25 call will be worth less than $500.If XYZ closes above $30,
the 2 Nov 30 calls must be bought back to close the trade, which
decreases the net return. The maximum loss of $130 occurs in the
extreme cases when XYZ closes either below $25 or above $35 at expi-
ration. The spread makes a profit whenever XYZ is between $26 and
$34 at expiration.
Comments
Example 1 illustrates both the positive and negative features ofthe but-
terfly spread. The positive features are that (1) it is typically an inex-
pensive trade,and (2) its maximum return provides plenty of leverage.
The negative features are that (1) the price range for a profit is rather
narrow, and (2) to achieve the maximum return, the timing is critical
because the stock price needs to be exactly at the sweet spot on the
expiration date.
As an alternate approach to Example 1, puts could have been used
rather than calls.That is,buy one Nov 35 put and one Nov 25 put,while
selling two Nov 30 puts. The cost and results for this put butterfly
would have been similar to those for the call butterfly,because the ini-
tial price of XYZ was at the sweet spot of both trades.
To target a sweet spot either above or below the current price of XYZ,
you should examine both a call butterfly and a put butterfly to see
which offers the cheaper price.The cost of a butterfly spread that has a
sweet spot significantly far from the current stock price is usually going
to be more expensive.Going out to a more distant expiration date will
generally reduce the cost of the butterfly.

Butterfly Trade with Adjustments
Let’s look at a different way of handling a butterfly spread that involves
an adjustment that is made somewhat later in the trade.This approach
will cater to a more volatile stock whose price tends to make dramatic
swings between price extremes during the timeframe of a few months.
■ Example 2.In early July,suppose XYZ is trading near $30,but
there is an indication that it may be moving up in the near
future.Set up a butterfly spread to initially focus on the $35 level.
Trade:
Buy 1 Nov 40 put for $9.90 per share.Cost = 9.90 ×100 = $990.
Sell 2 Nov 35 puts for $4.60 per share.Credit = 4.60 ×200 =
$920.
Buy 1 Nov 30 put for $.80 per share.Cost = .80 ×100 = $80.
Net credit = $150 [990 + 80 – 920 = 150].
Max risk = $150.
See Figure 23-2 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
Now let’s examine a couple of scenarios to see how this trade might
progress:
■ The ideal scenario is for the price of XYZ to coincide with the
sweet spot of $35 when the November options expire.In that
case,the Nov 40 put could be sold for $500,while the other
options all expire worthless.Thus,the net profit on the trade is
$350 [500 – 150 = 350],which represents a 233 percent return
on theinitial cost.
■ In another scenario that caters to more volatile price swings,
suppose that XYZ has run up to $38 in late September and
appears to have stalled at that level.The butterfly spread
mightshow a slight profit,but it would be too small to warrant
exiting the whole trade.However,the Nov 35 puts that were
originally sold for $4.60 might now be worth only $1.

An adjustment that could be made here is to buy back the
2Nov 35 puts to secure a $720 profit [920 – (1.0 ×200) = 720]
on those options.This adjustment leaves you with the following
residual position:
Long 1 Nov 40 put.Cost basis = $270 [990 – 720 = 270].
Long 1 Nov 30 put.Cost basis = $80.
Note:In this residual position,the $720 profit was applied to
the cost of the Nov 40 put,but could have been applied in any
convenient manner to the cost of the long puts.
The total cost basis ofthe residual position is $350 [270 + 80 =
350].This means that we have taken on an extra $200 ofrisk
beyond the original cost in an attempt to expand our profit range.
See Figure 23-3 for a risk graph that depicts the residual position.
This residual position has a great profit potential for any downside
move in XYZ.Suppose XYZ falls to $31 in early November.The Nov 40

put might be worth $9.20, and the Nov 30 put might be worth $.50.
Selling both options would bring in $970 [(9.20 + .50) ×100 = 970] for
a net profit of $620 [970 – 350 = 620]. That represents a 177 percent
gain based on the $350 cost basis of the residual position.
Comment
A word ofcaution about the butterfly spread ofExample 2.IfXYZ fails
to move up,the short Nov 35 puts are deep-in-the-money and will have
lost most of their time value by early November.In this case,there is a
danger of early assignment.
Unbalanced Butterfly Trade
Let’s consider an example of an unbalanced butterfly trade:
■ Example 3.In early July,the ZYX index is trading at $150 per
share.Your feeling is that,over the next two months,this index

is going to move sideways with a slight bias toward also moving
higher.To focus on the $150 price while also allowing for
upward movement,you initiate an unbalanced butterfly trade.
Trade:
Buy 1 Aug 145 put for $1.40 per share.Cost = 1.40 ×100 = $140.
Sell 2 Aug 150 puts for $3.20 per share.Credit = 3.20 ×200 =
$640.
Buy 1 Aug 152.50 put for $4.50 per share.Cost = 4.50 ×100 =
$450.
Net credit = $50 [640 – 140 – 450 = 50].
Max risk = $200.
See Figure 23-4 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.

Figure 23-4

This trade is established for a small credit. If ZYX is above $152.50 at
expiration,all the puts will expire worthless,and the credit becomes a
profit.As seen in Figure 23-4, this credit gives the butterfly an unbal-
anced bias toward the upside.
As with a standard butterfly,the maximum return occurs if ZYX closes
at the sweet spot of$150 on the August option’s expiration date.In that
case,the Aug $152.50 put can be sold for $250,while the other options
all expire worthless.Thus,the net profit on the trade is $300 [250 + 50 =
300],which includes the initial credit.
The maximum loss of $200 occurs whenever ZYX closes below $145 at
expiration.This unbalanced butterflyspread has a break-even point of
$147 at expiration.
