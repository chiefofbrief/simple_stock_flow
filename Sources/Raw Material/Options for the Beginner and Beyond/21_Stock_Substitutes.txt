STOCK SUBSTITUTES
A s discussed in Chapter 20, “Naked Option Writing,” there is
substantial risk in trades that involve uncovered short options.
Nevertheless,in some circumstances,it is worthwhile to consider
naked positions.In this chapter,we examine some situations in which
you can use naked puts and calls as cheap substitutes for stock.
Synthetic Long Stock
An at-the-money long call has a delta = 0.5,whereas an at-the-money
short (naked) put has a delta = –(–0.5) = 0.5.When held as a unit,the
combination ofa long call and a short put,with the same at-the-money
strike price,has a delta of 1.0 [0.5 – (–0.50) = 1.0].Because long stock
has a delta of 1.0, this combination of options is known as synthetic
stock.What makes this combination particularly appealing is that its net
cost is almost zero. The premium received from selling the naked put
will come very close to paying for the long call.
Although the net cost of the synthetic stock position is nearly zero,it
does come with some strings attached.Your broker will require some
margin to maintain this position,because of the naked put,but that is
typically far less than the cost of owning the real stock. The margin
required by brokerage firms varies,but a rule ofthumb is 25 percent of
the underlying stock (or index) price plus the price ofthe option ifthe
option is in-the-money.Ifthe option is out-of-the-money,that margin
figure is reduced by the amount that the option is out-of-the-money.
Let’s look at an example to illustrate synthetic long stock:
■ Example 1.In early June,XYZ stock is trading at $76.To par-
ticipate in the movement of this stock over the next three
161

months,October options are selected.The nearest strike price
is $75.Here is the trade that establishes the synthetic stock
position:
Trade:Buy 1 Oct 75 call for $4.50 per share and sell 1 Oct 75
put for $2.70,for a net cost of $1.80 per share.
Cost = $180.
Max risk = Essentially the same as the max loss from stock
ownership.
This synthetic stock position was created by using options with a $75
strike price.This means that all gains and losses in the synthetic stock
are referenced to $75.With the current price of XYZ at $76, this sug-
gests that the cost of this synthetic stock should ideally be $1 per share.
The actual cost of $1.80 per share contains an extra $.80,which repre-
sents the time value cost of holding this position.
See Figure 21-1 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.

To calculate the margin requirement on the preceding trade,notice that
the naked put is out-of-the-money by $1. Therefore, the margin
required is 25 percent of the XYZ stock price plus the price of the
Oct75 put less the amount the option is out-of-the-money.In this case,
the margin on one contract would be $2,070 {[(.25 × 76.00) + 2.70 –
1.00] × 100 = 2,070}. This margin requirement of $2,070 for the
synthetic stock is considerably less than the $7,600 cost of owning
100shares of the stock.Note that the margin requirement is not fixed,
but changes daily as the stock and option prices change.
From Figure 21-1,you can see that the profit and loss on this trade is
exactly the same as stock that was purchased for $76.80.
Comments
There are some drawbacks to synthetic stock.If the real stock pays div-
idends,this surrogate does not get a penny.And if the stock price were
to fall so far that the naked put becomes deep-in-the-money, there is
the possibility of an early assignment.When there is an assignment of
real stock,the synthetic position has been dismantled.Another minor
drawback is that when the options expire, a new synthetic position
needs to be established if you want to continue participating in the
stock price movement.
A synthetic position that is equivalent to a short stock position is creat-
ed by buying a put and selling a call with the same strike price.Unlike
shorting a stock,very little if any cash will be credited to your broker-
ageaccount.The margin required to hold the position will be based on
the naked short call.
Deep-in-the-Money Put
A short deep-in-the-money nakedputwill have a delta very close to one.
This makes this position a viable substitute for stock. As the stock
moves up in price,this position will capture the move almost dollar for
dollar, until the stock price nears the strike price of the short put.An
attractive feature of this stock surrogate is the large amount of cash
163
Chapter 21 Stock Substitutes

brought into your brokerage account from the sale of the very expen-
sive put.This cash earns interest as it sits in your account.
This naked put position will require margin in your brokerage account,
but still should not tie up nearly as much capital as owning the real
stock. The main disadvantage to this stock substitute is the possibility
ofan early assignment.Even though a naked put has an expiration date
in the distant future,it may have almost no time value included in its
price when it becomes very deep-in-the-money.This makes it vulnera-
ble to early assignment.Ifassigned,you can always reestablish the posi-
tion, but that can become tiresome and expensive because the
commission costs add up after several assignments. The best way to
avoid this problem is to pick a strike price not too deep-in-the-money,
so that the put price still includes some time value.Also,check the open
interest of the option.With a large open interest, the possibility of an
early assignment is diminished.
Let’s look at an example:
■ Example 2.In early June,XYZ stock is trading at $76.To par-
ticipate in the (upward) movement of this stock over the next
three months,an October put is selected.
Trade:Sell 1 Oct 90 put for $14.80 per share.
Credit = $1,480.
Max risk = Essentially the same as the max loss from stock
ownership.
Note that the option selected has a time value of $.80 per share [(76.00
+ 14.80) – 90.00 = 0.80].This time value together with an ample open
interest (say,at least 300 contracts) would mean that the chance for an
early assignment is unlikely.
See Figure 21-2 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
To calculate the margin requirement on this trade,notice that the naked
put is in-the-money.Therefore,the margin required is 25 percent ofthe
XYZ stock price plus the price ofthe Oct 90 put.In this case,the margin
on one contract would be $3,380 {[(.25 × 76.00) + 14.80] × 100 =
3,380}.This margin requirement of $3,380 is not as expensive as it first

seems,because the $1,480 cash brought into your account from the sale
of the put is used to meet the requirement. Thus, the effective margin
requirement is only $1,900, which is considerably less than the $7,600
cost ofowning 100 shares ofthe stock.Again,the margin requirement is
not fixed,but changes as the stock and option prices change.
A disadvantage of this naked put strategy is that its maximum profit is
limited to the amount ofmoney received from the sale ofthe put.Ifthe
stock price closes above the strike price of the put at expiration,there
will not be any additional profit related to the amount that the stock
price exceeds thestrike price (as shown in Figure 21-2).
Deep-in-the-Money Call
A short deep-in-the-money naked call will have a delta very close to
minus one.This makes this position a viable substitute for short stock.

As the stock moves down in price,this position will capture the move
almost dollar-for-dollar, until the stock price nears the strike price of
the short call.As with shorting the actual stock,this short stock surro-
gate brings cash into your brokerage account from the sale of the
expensive call.This cash earns interest as it sits in your account.
This naked call position will require margin in your brokerage account,
but still should not tie up nearly as much capital as shorting the real
stock.The possibility of an early assignment is somewhat less than for
the naked put position previously described,because calls always tend
to have more time value than puts.Also,with a large open interest,the
possibility of an early assignment is diminished. One situation that
does make the possibility of early assignment more likely is when a
stock pays a dividend. The owners of deep-in-the-money calls will
often exercise them before expiration when that action leads to the
receipt of a dividend.
This strategy for a synthetic short stock using naked calls is less often
used because it does not offer much advantage over shorting the real
stock.
Let’s look at an example:
■ Example 3.In early May,XYZ stock is trading at $76.To partic-
ipate in the downward movement of this stock over the next
three months,an October call is selected.
Trade:Sell 1 Oct 60 call for $16.90 per share.
Credit = $1,690.
Max risk = Essentially the same as the max loss from shorting
the stock.
Note that the option selected has a time value of$.90 per share [60.00–
(76.00 – 16.90) = 0.90]. This time value together with an ample open
interest (say,at least 300 contracts) means that the chance for an early
assignment is unlikely.
See Figure 21-3 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
To calculate the margin requirement on this trade,notice that the naked
call is in-the-money. Therefore, the margin required is 25 percent of

the XYZ stock price plus the price of the Oct 60 call. In this case, the
margin on one contract would be $3,590 {[(.25 × 76.00) + 16.90] ×
100 = 3,590}. As in the previous example, this margin requirement of
$3,590 is effectively reduced to $1,900 because of the $1,690 cash
brought into your account from the sale of the call.Again, the margin
requirement is not fixed, but changes as the stock and option prices
change.
A disadvantage of this naked call strategy is that its maximum profit is
limited to the amount ofmoney received from the sale ofthe call.Ifthe
stock price manages to be below the strike price of the short call at
expiration,there will not be any additional profit based on the amount
that the strike price exceeds the stock price,asshown in Figure 21-3.
