ADVANCED
CALENDAR SPREADS
T his chapter discuses some advanced concepts for calendar
spreads.
Volatility Skew Trades
Implied volatility (IV) is one of the most important pieces of options
data used in finding a good calendar spread.The primary use ofIV is to
determine whether an option is comparatively overpriced or under-
priced. Most options friendly brokerage firms provide IV data for
options.The value of the IV for an option is calculated from a theoret-
ical model for options pricing known as the Black-Scholes formula.
Some discussion of the calculation of implied volatility is provided in
Chapter 29,“Implied Volatility and the Black-Scholes Formula.”
Ifthe current IV ofan option is high compared to an annual average,it
means that the price of the option is inflated with extra time value.In
the case of calendar spreads,the IV data is used to make a comparison
between the long and short legs of the spread.To increase our chance
for success with a calendar spread,we want the short leg of the spread
to be overpriced as compared with the long leg. This volatility skew is
observed when the IV of the short option is larger than the IV of the
long option.
The numeric value of the volatility skew is the percentage increase in
the IV of the short option as compared with the IV of the long option.
You might think that the greater the skew, the better the chance for a
95

successful calendar spread. Unfortunately, this is not necessarily true.
Typically,volatility skews between 10 percent and 25 percent work best.
Be suspicious of IV skews that are 30 percent or greater, particularly
when both options have unusually high IVs.
An unusually high volatility skew often means that the front-month
options are being used for wild speculation in the underlying stock due
to some impending event that could dramatically alter the stock price.
For example, prior to an announcement of FDA approval (or disap-
proval) of a drug,it is common to observe IV skews of 50 percent and
greater.The danger here for a calendar spread is twofold:(1) When the
event happens,it may instantaneously move the stock price out of the
profitability range of the calendar spread. (2) Even if the stock price
remains unchanged,all the volatility will quickly collapse back to more
normal levels after the event has passed. This IV collapse is called a
volatility crush. Because this crush affects all the options, the price of
the long option in the calendar spread will be crushed to a fraction of
its original value, thereby destroying the potential for a profit in the
trade.
The bottom line here is that we want a “Goldilocks”IV skew: not too
cold and not too hot,but just right.
Let’s look at some examples of calendar spreads with a reasonable
volatility skew:
■ Example 1.In early May,XYZ is trading at $16.90,which
makes the $17.50 strike price a reasonable choice for a call cal-
endar spread.The IV for the Jun 17.5 call is 49,whereas the IV
for the Jan 17.5 call is only 41.That gives a skew of 19.5 percent
[(49 – 41)/41 = 0.195].
Trade 1:Buy 1 Jan (05) 17.5 call for $2.10 per share and sell 1 Jun
17.5 call for $1.15 per share.The net debit and maximum risk on
this trade is $95 [(2.10 – 1.15) ×100 = 95].
See Figure 13-1 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
This risk graph shows that the range of profitability is between $15
and $23.A maximum profit of $125 for a gain of 132 percent occurs if

XYZ closes at exactly $17.50 at the June options expiration. If XYZ
closes between $16 and $20.50, the spread should show a profit
between $50 and $125, for a gain between 53 percent and the maxi-
mum of 132 percent.
For a comparison,let’s look at a calendar spread on XYZ that uses put
options.With XYZ trading at $16.90, the $15 strike price seems like a
reasonable choice for a put calendar spread.
Trade 2:Buy 1 Jan 15 put for $1.60 per share and sell 1 Jun 15 put
for $.80 per share. Then, net debit and maximum risk on this
trade is $80 [(1.60 – .80) ×100 = 80].
The IV for the Jan (05) 15 put is 44,whereas the IV for theJun 15 put
is 52.That gives a skew of 18.2 percent [(52 – 44)/44 = 0.182].
See Figure 13-2 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.

This risk graph shows that the range ofprofitability is between $13 and
$18. A maximum profit of $100, for a gain of 125 percent, occurs if
XYZ closes at exactly $15 at the June options expiration.If XYZ closes
between $13.50 and $17, the spread should show a profit between
$30 and $100, for a gain between 38 percent and the maximum of
125percent.
Comments
Always do a little research on the stock you are considering for a calen-
dar spread.You want to determine whether there is any upcoming com-
pany event that might affect the IV of its options.
In comparing the call calendar spread (Trade 1) with the put calendar
spread (Trade 2),we note that the call spread is shifted toward a higher

price range,whereas the put spread is shifted toward a lower price range.
This is typical ofslightly out-of-the-money calendar spreads becausethe
maximum gain always occurs at the strike price.
The call spread and the put spread had about the same volatility skew,
but the call spread had a wider range ofprofitability ($15 to $23 for the
call spread versus $13 to $18 for the put spread).Part of the reason for
this was that the $17.50 strike used for the calls was closer to the stock
price of $16.90 than was the $15 strike price used for the puts.
If we had used in-the-money options instead of slightly out-of-the-
money options for these calendar spreads, the range of profitability
would have been a little narrower, whereas the maximum gain at the
strike price would have been larger. The reason for the larger gain is
that the option being sold has intrinsic value as well as time value.
Then, as the stock price moves toward the strike price, both intrinsic
value and time value are being captured.Of course,the long option is
also losing intrinsic value,but its overall price may be less affected.The
bottom line here is that ifthere is any benefit from using in-the-money
options for a calendar spread,it must be determined on an individual
case basis.
Ratio Calendar Spread Trades
A useful modification of the classic calendar spread trade is the ratio
calendar spread trade.The ratio concept simply means that fewer con-
tracts are sold than are bought.The purpose of having more long con-
tacts than short ones is to remove the constraint on one end of the
profitability range, thereby allowing for unlimited profit if the stock
price makes a large move in the appropriate direction.
Using either call or put options for the ratio calendar spread,fewer near
month contracts are sold than the number purchased ofdistant month
contacts.With calls,this has the effect of opening the upper end of the
risk graph for unlimited profit if the stock price moves higher.
Analogously,with puts,this has the effect of opening the lower end of
the risk graph for unlimited profit if the stock price moves lower.
The key issue here is what should be the ratio oflong contracts to short
contracts to achieve the best return.On the one hand,we want to keep
99

the cost basis low by having almost as many short options as long ones.
On the other hand,we want to achieve an increasing profit level if the
stock moves in the appropriate direction.Although there is no unique
answer here, some experience shows that ratios such as 3:2 or 4:3 are
good ones to consider.
To illustrate a ratio call calendar spread,let’s modify the above Trade 1
with a 4:3 ratio.
Trade 3:Buy 4 Jan (05) 17.5 calls for $2.10 per share and sell 3
Jun 17.5 calls for $1.15 per share.The net debit and maximum
risk on this trade is $495 [(2.10 ×400) – (1.15 ×300) = 495].
See Figure 13-3 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.

Figure 13-3

It is seen that the range of profitability at expiration is any price above
$15.60.In comparison with Trade 1,the lower bound of the profitabil-
ity range has been raised only slightly, whereas the upper bound has
been entirely removed.
For the standard calendar spread of Trade 1,the maximum return was
achieved only if XYZ closed at exactly the strike price of $17.50 at the
June expiration. Although the maximum return on investment was
132percent,that figure dropped offquickly ifthe closing price deviated
up or down from $17.50.By comparison,the ratio calendar spread of
Trade 3 has a return on investment of 81 percent at the strike price
$17.50,but has the benefit that the return is essentially the same for any
stock price up to $21. Above $21, things get even better as the return
rapidly increases without limit.
Comments
If you want to allow for a possible move in the stock price that would
take it outside ofthe range ofprofitability,consider modifying the stan-
dard calendar spread to that of a ratio calendar spread. As a starting
point,look at the number oflong contracts versus the number ofshort
contracts in ratios of 3:2 or 4:3.
Deep-in-the-Money LEAPS Put
Calendar Spreads
This is a special type of calendar spread intended for a 9 to 12-month
bullish position on stocks that have LEAPS put options. These trades
provide high leverage,but may require some unusual maintenance.To
do this type oftrade,the stock must offer LEAPS puts with strike prices
well above the current stock price. It helps if those puts also have sig-
nificant open interest, although you may be able to work around that
issue if necessary.
Basic strategy: Buy one long-term LEAPS put (21 to 24 months until
expiration) with a strike price that is well above the current price ofthe
stock and sell one nearer-term LEAPS put (9 to 12 months until expi-
ration) with the same strike price.

Chapter 13 Advanced Calendar Spreads

This creates a calendar spread where both legs are deep-in-the-money
puts.
The important feature ofthese deep-in-the-money puts is that they will
have relatively little time value included in their prices. Thus, even
though the long and short options are a year apart in expiration dates,
they will have nearly the same price.This will make the cost ofthis cal-
endar spread quite low and hence offer substantial leverage.
In the scenario for maximum profit on this spread, the stock will rise
over time so as to reach the strike price of the options at the expiration
date of the short leg. With the short put expiring worthless, the long
put will still have one full year’s worth of value,which can be immedi-
ately sold to achieve maximum profit.
The maintenance issue on this type of spread arises if you receive an
assignment on the short option. Typically, this only occurs if all the
time value disappears and the open interest is quite low.The remedy is
to sell the stock assigned to you and resell the same put option simulta-
neously.Be sure to do these two transactions together so as to reestab-
lish the spread at no net cost (aside from trade commissions).That is,
make sure that the proceeds received from the reselling the put option
will match the difference between the prices at which you buy and sell
the stock.
To illustrate this deep-in-the-money LEAPS put calendar spread,con-
sider ZYX stock with a current price of $49.You expect ZYX to be at
$65 in nine months.
Trade 4:Buy 1 Jan (08) 65 put at $19.30 per share and sell 1 Jan
(07) 65 put at $17.90 per share for a net debit of$1.40 per share.
Cost = $140.
Max risk = $140.
See Figure 13-4 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
Note that although the options being bought and sold are individually
quite expensive,the net cost for establishing the spread is only $140.

The maximum profit occurs when ZYX stock is at $65 as the Jan (07)
put expires worthless.An option calculator indicates the long Jan (08)
65 put would have a price of$8.20 per share.That represents a profit of
$680 [820 – 140 = 680],as seen in Figure 13-4,for a gain of485 percent.
If the price of ZYX is in the range of $57 to $77,the profit would be at
least $310,for a gain of225 percent or better.The downside break-even
point is ZYX at $49 at expiration.
Diagonal Calendar Spread Trades
Another version of the calendar spread is the diagonal spread, which
uses a different strike price in the front-month option than in the back
month.The basic idea is to select the long option to have a strike price
that is out-of-the-money compared to the strike price of the short
option. This reduces the cost of the calendar and in some cases even
creates an initial credit.

The diagonal spread trade frequently works best when the two strike
prices are no more than $2.50 apart,because it keeps the maximum risk
on the trade at a reasonable level. This means restricting this type of
trade to either low-priced or some medium-priced stocks, as well as
various indexes that have closely spaced strike prices.
Let’s look at an example involving the S&P 500 index as represented by
the SPDRs Trust (SPY), which has strike prices separated by $1. The
SPY is currently trading at $124.
Trade:Buy 1 Oct 126 call and sell 1 Sept 124 call for a net credit
of $.25 per share.
Initial Credit = $25.
Max risk = $175.

Figure 13-5

The risk graph in Figure 13-5 is typical of a diagonal spread with call
options, which is done for an initial credit. The risk graph calculator
estimates a break-even price of $126.25 at the September options expi-
ration date.Any price ofthe SPY below that level leads to a profit.Ifthe
SPY price falls to a low level,the profit is the initial credit received on
the trade.To suffer the maximum loss requires the SPY price to rise to
an extremely high level.In practice,the risk would be significantly less
than the theoretical maximum of $175.
An alternate view of the diagonal spread trade is the combination of a
regular calendar spread and a front-month credit spread.In the case of
the preceding example trade,consider the following two trades:
Calendar spread:Buy 1 Oct 126 call and sell 1 Sept 126 call for a
net debit of $.30 per share.
Vertical spread:Buy 1 Sept 126 call and sell 1 Sept 124 call for a
net credit of $.55 per share.
When both of these trades are done together, the sale of the Sept 124
call in the calendar spread is cancelled by the purchase of the same
option in the vertical spread.The result of this cancellation is the diag-
onal spread trade shown in Figure 13-5.In essence,the vertical spread
provides a credit that finances the cost of the calendar spread.
The diagonal spread offers several alternatives at the expiration date of
the front-month option.In the SPY trade shown above,ifthe price ofthe
SPY is below $124 at the September options expiration date, the short
call will expire worthless.This leaves the Oct 126 call free to become part
of another trade. For example, a bear call spread could be created by
selling Oct 124 call.
When the diagonal spread is created with calls,the attitude is that the
price of the underlying stock or index will move either sideways or
downward.As seen in Figure 13-5,the profit zone caters to a sideways
or downward movement of the SPY price. When the diagonal spread
is done with puts, the profit zone caters to a sideways or upward
movement.
