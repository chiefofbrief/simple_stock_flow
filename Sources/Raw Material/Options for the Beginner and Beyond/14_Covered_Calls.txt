COVERED CALLS
O ne of the first strategies that someone new to options hears
about is the covered call trade.Frequently,this strategy is touted
as a safe and simple way to make money with options. Many
brokerage firms allow covered calls as the only option trade that can be
made in a retirement account because it is “conservative.”
Unfortunately, describing covered call trades as conservative is some-
what misleading. Those same brokers who only allow covered call
trades in retirement accounts will claim that selling naked puts is much
too risky to be allowed in a retirement account.Well, at least they got
that part correct—selling naked puts does involve significant risk.The
truth is that a covered call trade carries essentially the same risk as sell-
ing a naked put.Later,it will demonstrated why this is true.
In its simplest form, the covered call trade requires that you own 100
shares of stock and then sell 1 out-of-the-money call contract. In this
trade,the short call is described as coveredbecause it is secured by your
long stock.If the option is exercised,you possess the stock required for
sale at the strike price.
The cash received from selling the call is yours to keep, provided that
you do not decide later to buy back the call.If the stock price is above
the strike price ofthe call at expiration,your stock will be called away for
a price that is higher than it was when you sold the call.Thus,you have
made money on the stock as well as the option.On the other hand,ifthe
stock price is below the strike price of the call at expiration,the option
expires worthless and you keep your stock. Then, the money received
from the sale ofthe option has reduced the cost basis ofyour stock,and
you are free to repeat the process in the next monthly option cycle.

If the covered call trade can be successfully repeated month after
month, it has the potential to produce a regular infusion of cash into
your brokerage account.Unfortunately,the process is not as simple as it
might seem. To do covered call trading, you need to understand the
inherent risk in this type oftrade and be prepared to make some tough
decisions as each month’s expiration date draws near.
An Idealized Trade
Let’s first examine how an idealized covered call trade might work to
perfection.
You buy 100 shares of XYZ at $30 per share for a total investment of
$3,000.Over the next seven months,this stock averages a monthly rise
of 9.5 percent as it moves up to $50 per share,for a great $2,000 profit.
To enhance this profit in each month along the way,you sell 1 call con-
tract (1 contract = 100 shares) on XYZ at a strike price that is about
10 percent to 15 percent above the stock price.Suppose that your sell-
ing price for each covered call is $1.20 per share, which brings in an
additional $120 per month. Assuming that the price of XYZ is never
above the strike price ofthe current month option as it expires,you will
be able to hold the stock through all seven months while bringing in an
additional profit of $840 [7 × 120 = 840]. So, when this covered call
strategy is working perfectly, you have increased your profit on this
investment from $2,000 (67 percent) to $2,840 (95 percent).
Although this idealized scenario could happen as described, it rarely
does. The most unrealistic aspect of this idealized trade is that it
requires the stock price to move up month by month in a perfectly
coordinated manner with the strike price of the short call.
A Realistic Trade
Let’s look at a real-life example of a covered call trade that did not
progress quite so idealistically.
In the preceding idealized example,the overall price movement of XYZ
is similar to that of Qualcomm Inc (QCOM) during 2003. From May
2003 to December 2003,QCOM moved from $30 to $50.Unfortunately,
108
OPTIONS FOR THE BEGINNER AND BEYOND

the month-by-month price movement of QCOM was not always coor-
dinated with the options expiration date so as to allow for an easy deci-
sion about how to proceed into the next month.
Suppose that you bought 100 shares of QCOM in May 2003 for $30
and sold 1 Jun 35 call for $1 a share.See Figure 14-1 for the risk graph
that depicts this trade.Note in the risk graph that the maximum profit
on the trade is $600 no matter how high the stock price climbs.

When the June expiration date arrives,you are confronted with a diffi-
cult decision,because the stock price is near $37.Do you (1) buy back
the short option for a loss so as to continue holding the stock or (2) do
you give up on any future gains in the stock by letting it be called away,
for a quick profit of $6 per share [35 – 30 + 1 = 6]?
If you decide to hold on to the stock,you must buy back the short call
for $2 per share, resulting in a loss of $1 per share in the option.You

could then sell the Jul 40 call for $2 per share.At the July expiration,the
$40 call expired worthless because QCOM had fallen back to $35.You
again had a difficult decision to make.Do you (1) sell one Aug 40 call
for only $.35 per share,while hoping for the stock price to recover,or
(2) sell one Aug 35 call for $2 per share in case the stock continues to
fall or just goes sideways for the next month?
So,in both ofthe first two months ofthis trade,tough decisions had to
be made. In later months, other difficult decisions presented them-
selves.Although not every month will necessarily pose such problems,
you can be sure that similar difficult decisions are going to arise if you
plan to hold your stock over a long period of time.The lesson here is
that the actual management ofcovered calls is rarely as straightforward
as described by an idealized example.
Covered Call vs. Naked Put
Now let’s get back to the issue of the risk in a covered call trade. To
make things definite, we will again use QCOM as an example. In late
December 2003,you buy 100 shares of QCOM at $53,and to complete
the covered call trade,you sell 1 Feb 55 call for $2 per share.This means
that you have equivalently purchased the stock for $51 per share, and
hence your maximum risk on this covered call trade is $5,100. See
Figure 14-2 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
IfQCOM is above $55 at the February options expiration,your stock will
be called away,which provides you a profit of$4 per share [55 – 51 = 4].
On the other hand,ifQCOM has fallen to $45 as the option expires,you
will be able to keep your stock, but the value of your stock will have
decreased by $6 per share [51 – 45 = 6].Now you are showing a loss of
$600 on the covered call trade.
Let’s compare this “conservative” covered call trade with the “risky”
trade ofselling a naked put on QCOM.Instead ofbuying QCOM stock,
suppose that you sell one Feb 55 put for $4 per share.The risk here is
that you will be required to buy 100 shares of QCOM at the equivalent
price of $51 per share [55 – 4 = 51], so again your maximum risk is
$5,100.See Figure 14-3 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.

If QCOM is above $55 at the February options expiration, the short
option will expire worthless and the cash brought in from selling the
put can then be counted as a $4 profit [4 – 0 = 4].On the other hand,
if QCOM has fallen to $45 as the option expires,the put will be exer-
cised,requiring you to buy the stock at $55 per share.This means that
you will then own 100 shares of QCOM stock in which you have suf-
fered a loss of $6 per share [55 – 4 – 45 = 6].
Thus, in either trade, similar circumstances lead to the same result of
net profit or net loss. This equivalence of the two trades is further
demonstrated by comparing Figure 14-2 with Figure 14-3.The bottom
line is that no matter what QCOM does,our profit or loss in selling a
naked put is the same as thecovered call trade.

Comments
Covered call trades are not really “conservative.”Buying 100 shares of
stock typically involves a significant outlay of capital.If the stock price
then falls precipitously,the dollar loss on the trade can be substantial.
This loss is exactly the same as if a naked put was sold and then the
stock price fell.Also,the potential profit from a covered call is capped,
just as it is when a naked put is sold.
The month-by-month management ofcovered call trades can be tricky.
Some months are going to require a tough decision as the expiration
date arrives.
One advantage enjoyed by a covered call over a naked put is that you do
participate in any dividend payments. Naked put positions enjoy the
advantage oftying up less cash and creating extra leverage in your bro-
kerage account.You must,however,be wary ofusing that extra leverage

in an unwise manner, such as increasing the size of your naked put
position beyond a reasonable level.This can lead to an unpleasant mar-
gin call from your broker if the stock suffers a sudden drop.
Here are some suggestions for handling covered call trades:
1. Because almost all your risk is in what you paid for the
stock,keep you eyes on the stock price and to a much lesser
extent on the option price.Decide on an appropriate stop
loss price for the stock,and if it falls to that level,protect the
major portion of your investment by selling the stock and
buying back the call.Do not hang on to a falling stock to
collect an extra $.40 on the short option.
2. When deciding on the strike price of the call that you are
going to sell,make sure it is a price you will feel comfortable
about giving up your stock if that becomes necessary.If your
primary goal is to keep your stock,select a higher strike
price.If you are willing to sell your stock at a price closer to
its current value,pick a nearby strike price to bring in more
cash.
3. Do not go too far out in time.Those juicy premiums in the
longer-term options are tempting,but you will generally do
better by selling either the front-month call or the next
month out.In today’s volatile market,the price of a stock
can move significantly (up or down) in four to eight weeks.
By selling near-month options,you will be better placed to
make an adjustment when the expiration date arrives.
4. Do not be greedy.If the stock price is above the strike price
at expiration,avoid buying back the option for a loss unless
you have a good reason to do so.If you have followed Step 2,
you should be willing to let the stock go and take your profit.
Avoid the situation in which you buy back the option for a
loss to keep your stock,and then have the stock price col-
lapse.This compounds a loss on the option with a loss on
the stock.
