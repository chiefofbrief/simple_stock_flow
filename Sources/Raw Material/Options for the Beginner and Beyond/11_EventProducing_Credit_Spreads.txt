EVENT-PRODUCING
CREDIT SPREADS
T o further illustrate vertical spread trades,this chapter explores an
idea for finding good credit spreads with options. We indicate
when to enter the credit spread and how to structure it.
First let’s review the three major elements that typically characterize a
good vertical credit spread:
1. A credit spread works best when extra premium has been
pumped into the price of the option being sold.
2. A good credit spread is structured so that the underlying
stock price needs little or no movement to achieve maxi-
mum profit.
3. Conditions are such that 1 and 2 can be realized using front-
month options.
Now let’s see when we might expect to find the circumstances that
would give rise to 1,2,and 3.
Look for an event that produces a major move in the price of a stock
price accompanied by exceptionally high volume. This can be a move
up or down in price. Most important, the cause for this major move
must be an event that is essentially concluded after the news is out.We
want to see a dramatic move in the stock price followed by a relatively
short period of time in which the stock price stabilizes or slightly
reverses the big move.This kind of situation pumps lots of extra time
value into the front-month options as traders scramble to cover
79

existing positions or attempt to ride the momentum wave in the hope
thata second burst will follow.
The idea is to not enter the credit spread until the dust has had a chance
to settle.The aim is to place the short leg ofthe spread near the extreme
price attained during the dramatic move. This may require careful
observation for a few days in case there is another surge that needs to
exhaust itself.
What kind of events might produce the desired scenario:
■ A major earnings surprise.Once announced,there is nothing
else to be said about earnings for the immediate future.It may
take a couple of days for stock traders to unravel their posi-
tions,but then the story is over.
■ Government approval or disapproval ofa product.This often
describes a well-publicized drug that has been awaiting an FDA
ruling for testing or marketing.After the decision has been
made,the effect on the company profits is calculated,and the
price moves to reflect the revised view of stock value.This is
the end of story for the immediate future.
■ A proposed buyout(particularly when viewed as a buyout that
might not ultimately occur).The stock price gaps up to reflect
the suggested buyout price,but then begins to pull back as the
likelihood of the buyout begins to be questioned.
Let’s look at some examples of setting up a credit spread following a
special event:
■ Example 1.Rambus,Inc (RMBS).On February 12,2004,it was
announced that European patent officials had revoked a patent
claim by RMBS.This meant that the company would not be
able to collect on a large amount of royalty fees from competi-
tors in certain global markets.On huge volume,the stock
quickly fell from the $30 level to close at $24.35.
The bad news was out and the damage was done.This was a
one-time type of event that was not likely to lead to any further

related bad news.The big drop on huge volume suggested that
the sellers had completed expressing their feelings.The chart
onRMBS provided additional evidence that the stock had
bottomed because of strong support at $24 going back to
November 2003.The next day the stock began a little rebound
back to the $25 level.This was a good opportunity to initiate
the following credit spread:
Trade:Buy 1 Mar 22.5 put and sell 1 Mar 25 put for a net credit
of $1.25 per share.
Credit = $125.
Max risk = $125 [(25 – 22.5 – 1.25) ×100 = 125].
See Figure 11-1 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.

A good goal on these credit spreads is to receive a credit that
nearly equals or possibly even exceeds the max risk.This kind
of opportunity often presents itself following a special event
that produces a dramatic price move accompanied by high vol-
ume.Such circumstances often pump the extra premium into
the at-the-money options that creates good credit spreads.
As with most credit spreads,time is your friend,which suggests
the use of near-term options.In this case with RMBS,the
February options were expiring in only eight days,which was a
little too soon and did not offer the desired credit.Hence the
choice of the March puts for the trade.To realize the max profit
on this trade,RMBS just needed to close above $25 at the
March options expiration in five weeks.
On March 19,2004,RMBS closed at $27.21,and the options
expired worthless.The maximum profit was realized.
■ Example 2.Walt Disney Co.(DIS).On February 11,2004,there
was news of the intention of Comcast Corp to buy DIS.The
price of DIS rose quickly from the $24 level to a high of $28 on
huge volume.It was immediately made clear that DIS regarded
this as a hostile offer that would be resisted.So,unless Comcast
was going to increase their offer,this situation would be in
doubt for the immediate future.Within two days,the excite-
ment was quieting,and the price of DIS began to retreatback
to $27.This was a good opportunity to initiate the following
credit spread:
Trade:Buy 1 Mar 30 call and sell 1 Mar 27.5 call for a net credit
of $1.30 per share.
Credit = $130.
Max risk = $120 [(30.0 – 27.5 – 1.3) ×100 = 120].
See Figure 11-2 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.

12 days left
Expiry: 0 days left
–200 –100 0 100
In this example,a special event has created considerable
interestin an otherwise quiet stock.The gap up in price on
huge volume pumped extra premium into the at-the-money
options.To achieve a max profit on this credit spread only
required that DIS close below $27.50 at the March options
expiration.
On March 19,2004,DIS closed at $25.39,and the options
expired worthless.The maximum profit was realized.
■ Example 3.Apple Computer Inc.(AAPL).On April 14,2005,
the stock began to fall from the $40 level with high volume
inspite of a good earnings report.Over the next few
sessions,the stock price fell to $34 before beginning to stabilize.

This was a good opportunity to initiate the following credit
spread:
Trade:Buy 1 May 32.5 put and sell 1 May 35 put for a net
credit of $1.20 per share.
Credit = $120.
Max risk = $130 [(35 – 32.5 – 1.20 ) ×100 = 130].
See Figure 11-3 for a risk graph that depictsthis trade.
Today: 35 days left
24 days left
12 days left
Expiry: 0 days left
–200 –100 0 100
In this example,a strong company sold off on good earnings,
apparently because investors worried about how long it could
continue to produce such outstanding growth.The excessive
selling pumped extra premium into the near-term options.

Toachieve a max profit on this credit spread only requires that
AAPL close above $35 at the May options expiration.
On May 20,2005,AAPL closed at $37.55,and the options
expired worthless.The maximum profit was realized.
Comments
Finding opportunities for these credit spreads does not require hearing
about the special event as it is happening.In fact,you should wait a day
or two (perhaps even longer) for the price burst associated with the
public awareness of the event to exhaust itself.On the other hand,you
cannot wait too long, because the extra premium pumped into the
option prices will soon dissipate.
It is important to research the background of the special event that
caused the dramatic move in the stock price.Make sure it is the type of
event that is unlikely to have further repercussions in the near future.
The event can be either a good-news or a bad-news situation,as long as
it is all ofthe story.Avoid events announced as “accounting irregularities”
or “possible restatement ofearnings,”because these are all too often fol-
lowed by further revelations that push the stock down even more.
