STRADDLES AND
STRANGLES
T he straddle trade and the strangle trade are intended to take
advantage of stock movement in either direction. They use a
combination of a call option and a put option to benefit from a
significant move up or down in the stock price.
The Straddle Trade
Upon first learning about the straddle trade,it sounds like the answer
to a trader’s dream.You will hear that,with a straddle,you do not need
to guess which way the stock will move.The straddle can make money
if either the stock price goes up or it goes down.What could be better
than that?
The basic idea ofa straddle trade is to buy a call and buy a put with the
same strike price. These options should also have the same expiration
month, usually about two to three months in the future. The reason
given for doing this type of trade is that if the stock price goes up,the
call will show a profit; and if the stock price goes down, the put will
show a profit. The catch here is that when one option shows a profit,
the other option will show a loss.
Even though the straddle trade concept sounds wonderful,it is actually
one ofthe more difficult option trades with which to make a profit.For
the straddle to become profitable, the stock price must move far
enough so that the profit in one option more than offsets the loss in the
other.Ifthe stock price manages only a modest move in either direction
before the options expire,the trade will lose money.

The major obstacle to a successful straddle trade is time. Remember
that when you own an option,time is your enemy.With a straddle,you
own two options,so time is working against both legs of the trade.
Sooner or later, you will want to try a straddle trade. Under the right
circumstances,a straddle can work well.The difficulty is in identifying
a stock that meets the right criteria.
Let’s look at an example of a straddle trade:
■ Example 1.In late May,XYZ stock is trading around $30.There
is conflicting news surrounding XYZ.Some reports are saying
that the company will soon issue a warning that its next quarter
earnings will fall far short of expectations.Other reports are
suggesting that a competitor is planning to make an offer to
buy out XYZ at a substantial premium.
To cater to either of these dramatic events,you initiate a strad-
dle trade by buying both a call option and a put optionwith
the same strike price.Here is how that might look:
Trade:Buy 1 Aug 30 call for $2.10 per share and buy 1 Aug 30
put for $1.90 per share.
Cost = $400 [(2.10 + 1.90) ×100 = 400].
Max risk = $400.
Figure 15-1 provides a risk graph that depicts this trade.
Now the argument is made that you do not care what happens with XYZ.
Ifthe stock makes a big move up or down,one ofyour options is going to
provide a nice profit.This is the attractive feature of the straddle trade;it
has the potential to make money no matter which way the stock moves.
First, let’s consider some ideal scenarios which lead to profitable out-
comes for this straddle trade on XYZ:
1. In mid-June,the earnings warning on XYZ is issued,and the
stock price quickly drops to $25.Because of the rapid drop,
the price of the Aug 30 put expands to $6.20 per share.The
Aug 30 call still has two months before expiration and man-
ages to hold on to a price of $.50 a share.By selling both
options for a total of $670 [(6.20 + .50) ×100 = 670],you
have made a $270 profit for a gain of 68 percent.

2. There is no earnings warning and in early July an offer is
made to buy out XYZ at $35 per share.The price of XYZ
stock becomes essentially frozen at the buy out price,and the
options lose most oftheir time value.The Aug 30 call is priced
at $5.30 per share and the Aug 30 put at $.20 per share.By
selling both options for a total of $550 [(5.30 + .20) ×100 =
550],you have made a $150 profit for a gain of 38 percent.
3. Occasionally,it is possible to profit from both options.When
XYZ issues the earnings warning that drops the stock to $25,
you sell the Aug 30 put for $6.20 per share.The put leg of the
straddle has then produced a profit of $430 [(6.20 – 1.90) ×
100 = 430].Having a guaranteed profit of $30 [430 – 400 =
30] on the overall trade,you decide not to sell your Aug 30
call for $.50 per share,but rather hold it for future
developments.This decision is rewarded a few weeks
laterwhen the deal to buy XYZ at $35 does take place and
117

you are able to sell the Aug 30 call for $5.30 per share.
Thecall leg of the straddle has then produced a profit $320
[(5.30 – 2.10) ×100 = 320].The combined profits from both
legs of the straddle trade is $750 [430 + 320 = 750],for a
fantastic gain of 188 percent.
Now let’s be a little more realistic and see how easy it is for the possible
outcomes of the straddle trade to be less than ideal:
1A. The disappointing earnings for XYZ are not revealed until
late July,and the stock price only drops to $27.50.With
just a few weeks remaining until the options expire,there
is little time value remaining in the Aug 30 put,which is
priced at $2.80 per share.The Aug 30 call is priced at only
$.20 per share.You exit both options for $300 [(2.80 +
.20)×100 = 300].This represents a loss of $100 or
25 percent of your original investment of $400.
2A. There is no earnings warning and in early August a hostile
offer for XYZ at $32 is made public.Again with just a cou-
ple of weeks of life remaining in the Aug 30 call,it is priced
at only $2.30 per share,whereas the Aug 30 put has fallen
to $.15 per share.You exit both options for $245 [(2.30 +
.15)×100 = 245].This represents a loss of $155,or
39 percent of your original investment.
3A. You wait hopefully until the second week ofAugust,but no
bad earnings news or potential buyout of XYZ is reported.
The stock price has remained in a narrow range around
$30 ever since you initiated the straddle trade.Now with
almost no time remaining until the optionsexpire,the
Aug30 call is priced at $.80 per share and the Aug 30 put
at $.60 per share.If you exit both options for $140 [(.80 +
.60)×100 = 140],you will have experienced a loss of $360,
or 90 percent of your original investment.
By contrasting the losing outcomes 1A,2A,and 3A with the profitable
outcomes of1,2,and 3,several drawbacks ofthe straddle trade become
apparent.Most important,any event that you are expecting to move the
stock price must be significant enough to cause a large increase in the
price of the appropriate option. Also, the event must occur relatively
118
OPTIONS FOR THE BEGINNER AND BEYOND

soon after initiating the straddle to avoid the loss of too much time
value.With a straddle,the ongoing loss oftime value is doubly harmful
because it is occurring in both options of the trade.
There is another subtle danger with straddle trades.Ifthe rumors about
a possible price-altering event are fairly well circulated,the prices ofthe
at-the-money options will become inflated due to the increase in
implied volatility (see Chapter 28,“Theory of Maximum Pain”). This
makes it more expensive to initiate the straddle, thereby reducing the
chance for a profit even if the desired event does come to pass. In
thepreceding example,a heightened interest in XYZ might increase the
purchase price ofthe Aug 30 call and Aug 30 put by $.85 per share each.
Then the cost of initiating the straddle would become $570.Now out-
come 2 results in a loss,and 1 is substantially less profitable.
Comments
The key to a successful straddle trade is to identify a stock that satisfies
the right criteria.Here are someguidelines:
1. The stock price should be within the range of $20 to $50.If
the stock is cheaper than $20,it may not have enough room
for the price to fall.If the stock price is above $50,the
options may be too expensive to create a straddle with a
good potential for profit.
2. Identify an upcoming event that could significantly impact
theprice of the stock.Ideally,the event needs to be such that
the stock price will rise on positive news and fall on negative
news.Good candidates are earnings announcements,court
decisions,and FDA rulings.
3. The upcoming event should be at least 30 to 60 days away.
The options used for the straddle should not expire until at
least 30 days after the expected event.This typically means
that the options used will have a life of at least 60 to 90 days
at the time the straddle is initiated.
4. The upcoming event should not yet have generated enough
excitement to cause the options prices to be overly inflated.
This can be judged in several ways.Check the level of open
119
Chapter 15 Straddles and Strangles

interest and trading volume in the options.Compare the
current implied volatility of the options against historical
averages.
5. Look for a stock that has been trading sideways within a nar-
row price range.This signifies an even battle between the
buyers and sellers of the stock.When the stock does break-
out (up or down),the option prices will gain extra time
value and the straddle has an increased potential for profit.
Here are some guidelines for exiting the straddle trade:
1. Sometimes it will be best to exit one side of the straddle
before the expected event occurs.For example,in an earn-
ings run,the stock price may move up sharply just prior to
the scheduled earnings announcement.In this case,it may
be wise to take the profit on the call leg before the actual
announcement and hold the put until afterward.If the stock
price then falls after the announcement,there will be a better
exit price for the put.
2. Do not stay in the straddle too long after the event has
takenplace.If the event does cause a significant move in the
stock price,it will temporarily pump extra time value into
the price of the profitable option.Sell the profitable option
before that extra time value shrinks.
3. Never hold both sides of the straddle until expiration.
Generally,this will lead to a near maximum loss on the
trade.If nothing has happened to create a price move,the
straddle will lose a substantial portion of its value during the
last three to four weeks of its life.Exit when there is at least
three to four weeks before the options expire to recover what
you can of your original investment.This is the reason that
options expiring at least 30 days after the expectedevent are
used in the straddle trade.
The Strangle Trade
A strangle trade is similar to a straddle trade, except that the call and
put options have different strike prices.The idea is to lower the cost of
120

the trade by using out-of-the-money options.Essentially,this is a more
aggressive version of the straddle trade.
Let’s reconsider Example 1, where XYZ is trading around $30 in late
May.Now try to play the upcoming events with a strangle trade.
Trade:Buy 1 Aug 35 call for $.80 per share and buy 1 Aug 25 put
for $.70 per share.
Cost = $150 [(0.80 + 0.70) ×100 = 150].
Max risk = $150.
See Figure 15-2 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.

This straddle trade is a much cheaper trade than the corresponding
straddle trade.A comparison of Figure 15-1 and Figure 15-2 indicates
that for the strangle to achieve the same percentage profit after 70 days
requires a larger move in the stock price.
