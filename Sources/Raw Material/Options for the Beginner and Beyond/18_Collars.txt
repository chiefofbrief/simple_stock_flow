COLLARS
T he collar trade has particular appeal to conservative investors.
This is a trade for those who like to hold stocks for the long-
term,while using options to provide insurance and still allow for
a nice return.One reason the collar trade is so attractive is its high level
of protection of principal.
During 2000 to 2002, there were many stocks that investors and ana-
lysts believed were good to hold for the long term.Unfortunately,a sig-
nificant number of those “good stocks”lost 40 percent to 50 percent or
even more of their value during that period of time. If those stocks
whose price collapsed had been properly collared with options,the loss
would have been held to less than 10 percent. And for those collared
stocks that did manage to move up during the bear market,annualized
returns of 15 percent to 25 percent were possible.
The collar trade is intended for use with stocks that are worthy ofbeing
held for at least 10 to 12 months.To do a collar trade,the stock needs
to have LEAPS options associated with it. As discussed in Chapter 6,
“LEAPS,”these long-term options have expiration dates that may be as
much as two years or more into the future.
Let’s look at an example of a collar trade:
■ Example 1.In November 2004,you identify XYZ as a stock
worthy of being held for the next 14 months.XYZ is currently
trading at $19 per share and it has LEAPS options.
Trade:Buy 100 shares of XYZ for $1,900.Buy 1 Jan (06)
20putfor $2.90 per share and sell 1 Jan (06) 25 call for
$1.00per share.The net cost for the two options is

$190 [(2.90 – 1.00) ×100 = 190].The net cost for the whole
trade is $2,090 [1,900 + 190 = 2,090].
See Figure 18-1 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
Although it is possible to exit this trade at any time,it is
designed to be held until the options expiration date in
January 2006.Let’s examine the best- and worst-case scenarios
at expiration.
The worst-case scenario means that the stock price is below $20
on the options expiration date.In this situation,the Jan (06)
25call expires worthless,while you exercise the Jan (06) 20 put
to force someone to buy your stock at $20 per share.You
receive $2,000 from the sale of your stock and your net loss on
the trade is only $90 [2090 – 2000 = 90].This small loss
represents only 4.3 percent of your original investment.

The best-case scenario occurs when the stock price is over $25
on the option’s expiration date.In this situation,the Jan (06) 20
put expires worthless and someone exercises the Jan (06) 25 call
against you,so that your stock is sold for $25 per share.You
receive $2,500 for your 100 shares of stock,and your net profit
on the trade is $410 [2,500 – 2,090 = 410].This represents a
gain of 20 percent on your original investment.For the
14-month period that you are in this trade,that translates
toa17 percent gain on an annualized basis.
From Example 1,you can see why this combination of stock and
options is called a collar trade.The two options form a “collar”
around the long stock position.The long Jan (06) 20 put forms
the protective part of the collar by insuring that the stock can be
sold for no less than $20 per share anytime before the option
expires.The Jan (06) 25 call,which was sold to reduce the cost
of the put,forms the restrictive part of the collar that limits the
upside selling price of the stock to $25 per share.
It is often possible to arrange the collar trade so that it is com-
pletely without risk.Usually,this will mean giving up some of
the potential profit.Let’s look at an example:
■ Example 2.As in Example 1,we will buy XYZ stock for $19 per
share with the intention of holding it for the next 14 months.
But now we will go for an even higher level of protection.
Trade:Buy 100 shares of XYZ for $1900.Buy 1 Jan (06) 22.5
put for $4.50 per share and sell 1 Jan (06) 25 call for $1 per
share.The net cost of the two options is $350 [(4.50 – 1.00) ×
100 = 350].The net cost for the whole trade is $2,250 [1,900 +
350 = 2,250].
See Figure 18-2 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
In this example,the worst-case scenario is the stock price below
$22.50 on the option’s expiration date.In this situation,the Jan
(06) 25 call expires worthless,while you exercise the Jan (06)
22.5 put to force someone to buy your stock at $22.50 per
share.You receive $2,250 from the sale of your stock,which is

exactly the original cost of the trade,thereby allowing you to
exit with no loss.
The best-case scenario is again when the price of XYZ is over
$25 atexpiration.The Jan (06) 22.5 put expires worthless and
someone exercises the Jan (06) 25 call against you so that your
stock is sold for $25 per share.You receive $2,500 for your
100 shares of stock and your net profit on the trade is $250
[2,500 – 2,250 = 250].This represents a gain of 11 percent on
your original investment.For the 14-month period that you
are in this trade,that translates to a 9.5 percent gain on an
annualized basis.
Although the maximum potential gain in Example 2 is signifi-
cantly less than in Example 1,keep in mind that the collar
tradein Example 2 carries no risk of principal.This may be

particularly important for someone whose portfolio includes a
large holding in XYZ stock.
If you are willing to accept a little more risk,the collar can be
loosened to allow for a larger profit potential,as Example 3
shows.
■ Example 3.As in the previous two examples,we buy XYZ stock
for $19 per share with the intention of holding it for the next
14 months.But now we go for a higher maximum return while
accepting a little more risk.
Trade:Buy 100 shares of XYZ for $1,900.Buy 2 Jan (06) 20 put
for $2.90 per share and sell 1 Jan (06) 30 call for $.60 per share.
The net cost for the 2 options is $230 [(2.90 – .60) ×100 = 230].
The net cost for the whole trade is $2,130 [1,900 + 230 = 2,130].

Figure 18-3

As in Example 1,the worst-case scenario is the stock price
below $20 on the option’s expiration date.In this situation,the
Jan (06) 30 call expires worthless,while you exercise the Jan
(06) 20 put to force someone to buy your stock at $20 per
share.You receive $2,000 from the sale of your stock,and your
net loss on the trade is $130 [2,130 – 2,000 = 130].This loss
represents 6.1 percent of your original investment.
The best-case scenario occurs again when the stock price
isover$30 on the option’s expiration date.In this situation,
theJan (06) 20 put expires worthless,and someone exercises
theJan (06) 30 call against you,sothat your stock is sold for
$30 per share.You receive $3,000 for your 100 shares of
stockand your net profit on the trade is $870 [3,000 – 2,130=
870].This represents a gain of 41 percent on your original
investment.For the 14-month period that you are inthis
trade,that translates to a 35 percent gain on an annualized
basis.
In this example,the maximum gain is significantly better than
that of Example 1,but the maximum loss has been increased.
Let’s reconsider the Example 1 trade and see the difference if we
extend that trade for an additional 12 months.
■ Example 4.As in Example 1,we buy XYZ stock for $19 per
share.But now the intention is to hold it for the next 26 months.
Trade:Buy 100 shares of XYZ stock for $1,900.Buy 1 Jan (07)
20 put for $3.40 per share and sell 1 Jan (07) 25 call for $2.30
per share.The net cost for the 2 options is $110 [(3.40 – 2.30) ×
100 = 110].The net cost for the whole trade is $2010 [1,900 +
110 = 2,010].
See Figure 18-4 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
The worst-case scenario means that the stock price is below
$20on the option’s expiration date.In this situation,the
Jan(07) 25 call expires worthless,while you exercise the
Jan(07) 20 put to force someone to buy your stock at $20 per
share.You receive $2,000 from the sale of your stock and your

net loss on the trade is only $10 [2,010 – 2,000 = 10].
Thissmall loss represents only 0.5 percent of your original
investment.This is essentially a riskless trade.
The best-case scenario occurs when the stock price is over $25
on the option’s expiration date.In this situation,the Jan (07)
20put expires worthless and someone exercises the Jan (07)
25call against you,so that your stock is sold for $25 per share.
You receive $2,500 for your 100 shares of stock,and your net
profiton the trade is $490 [2,500 – 2,010 = 490].This
represents a gain of 24 percent on your original investment.For
the 26-month period that you are in this trade,that translates
to an 11 percent return on an annualized basis.
It is worthwhile to compare Examples 1 and 4.We see that by going to
a longer-term scenario,the trade becomes essentially riskless.The max-
imum potential profit has increased slightly,although the return on an

annualized basis is less.The trade in Example 4 would appeal to a con-
servative investor who is willing to accept a modest return when his
investment capital is almost fully protected from loss.
Comments
Collar trades are designed to be long-term trades.Trying to set up a col-
lar trade for a period of less than 10 to 12 months will not provide the
level of protection seen in the examples presented here.
Because the collar trades use LEAPS options, they generally can be
structured for 22 to 24 months duration if so desired.With the longer
duration,the maximum potential gain and maximum loss are typically
better than the 10-to-12-month versions of the collar trade, as seen
by comparing Examples 1 and 4. A major drawback to the 22-to-
24-months collar trade is the cap placed on the upward price move-
ment of the stock. If your stock is well above the strike price of the
short call after 12 months, you will not be pleased that your profit is
already capped while it will take another 10 to 12 months before the
maximum return is achieved.
It is possible to exit a collar trade early; however,to achieve the maxi-
mum return generally requires staying in the trade until expiration.In
Example 1,ifXYZ reaches $25 with six months remaining until expira-
tion,the profit would be only about half of the $410 maximum.When
the stock price falls,it is often possible to exit the collar trade early for
a slightly smaller loss than the maximum.
The collar trade is enhanced if the stock pays a dividend.In Example 1,
suppose that XYZ pays an annual dividend of $.65 per share.That rep-
resents an annualized yield of3.4 percent,which is equivalent to 4.0 per-
cent for the 14-month duration of the collar. This means that the
maximum return on the trade in Example 1 is increased to 24 percent,
whereas the maximum loss has been reduced to a miniscule 0.3 percent.
Collar trades on highly volatile stocks are generally not as appealing as
they are for more conservative stocks.The higher volatility will usually
result in a much greater net cost for the options that provide the collar.
This will increase the maximum possible loss onthe trade.
