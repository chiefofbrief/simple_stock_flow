LEAPS
S ome stocks and indexes have options with expiration dates that
occur two to three years into the future.These options are called
LEAPS, which is an acronym for Long-term Equity AnticiPation
Securities.Most LEAPS expire in January of their designated expiration
year. These options include both calls and puts that function in the
same manner as options associated with more-current expiration dates.
Of course, these long-term options are relatively expensive because of
their greatly extended lifetime.
You can use LEAPS in numerous ways.We discuss some of those uses
here, while pointing out both the advantages and disadvantages of
LEAPS. Because there can be drawbacks to using these long-term
options,you should always “Look before you LEAPS.”
One ofthe more popular uses ofLEAPS is as a substitute for a buy-and-
hold stock.In fact,LEAPS are sometimes referred to as the poor man’s
stock.This is because they can be purchased for a fraction ofthe cost of
stock and then held for a long period of time.
To explore this concept of using a LEAPS call as a stock surrogate,let’s
look at an example in which we compare the performances of the
option and the stock.
In early December 2004,XYZ stock is trading near $98 per share.If we
buy 100 shares of stock, the cost is $9,800. Suppose instead, we buy a
LEAPS call that will expire in about 25 months.
Trade:Buy 1 Jan (07) 100 call option for $11.50 per share.
Cost = $1,150.
Max risk = $1,150.
See Figure 6-1 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.

For a cost that is only 12 percent the cost of owning the stock,we can
participate in the price movementof 100 shares of XYZ until the third
Friday ofJanuary 2007,which is a little more than 2 years in the future.
This sounds like a fantastic deal, and under the right circumstances it
can be fantastic.But there are also circumstances in which it may not be
advantageous to own the LEAPS call in place of the stock.
Now let’s look ahead to some possible outcomes after 8 months and
after 17 months:
■ Scenario 1.After 8 months
XYZ is at $120 for a 22 percent gain in stock value.The Jan (07)
100 call will show a profit of about $1,400,for a 122 percent
gain in value.This dramatically illustrates the leverage of
LEAPS options.

XYZ is at $110,for a 12 percent gain in stock value.The Jan (07)
100 call will show a profit of about $600,for a 52 percent gain
in value.The LEAPS call is still providing a fantastic return.
XYZ is at $104,for a 6 percent gain in stock value.The Jan (07)
100 call will show a profit of about $90,for an 8 percent gain in
value.The LEAPS call is slightly better.
XYZ is at $100 for a 2 percent gain in stock value.The Jan (07)
100 call will show a loss of about $100,for a 9 percent drop in
value.This illustrates that even a LEAPS call experiences some
loss in time value over the first eight months of its lifetime.
XYZ is at $95,for a 3 percent loss in stock value.The Jan (07)
100 call will show a loss of about $500,for a 43 percent drop in
value.Here the LEAPS call has suffered a more dramatic loss of
value because the stock price issignificantly below the strike
price of the option.
You can see the results for Scenario 1 in Figure 6-1 by looking
near the line for 502 days left.
■ Scenario 2.After 17 months
XYZ is at $120,for a 22 percent gain in stock value.The Jan (07)
100 call will show a profit of about $1,200,for a 104 percent
gain in value.The return on the LEAPS call is still dramatically
better after a full year.
XYZ is at $110,for a 12 percent gain in stock value.The Jan (07)
100 call will show a profit of about $400,for a 35 percent gain in
value.Again,the LEAPS call provides a much better return.
XYZ is at $105,for a 7 percent gain in stock value.The Jan (07)
100 call will be nearly at a break-even status.After a full year,
the LEAPS call has suffered enough loss of time value to offset
a small gain in its intrinsic value.
XYZ is at $100,for a 2 percent gain in stock value.The Jan (07)
100 call will show a loss of about $300,for a 26 percent drop in
value.The time decay over an additional 9 months has increased
the loss of value in the option from 9 percent to 26 percent.

Chapter 6 Leaps

XYZ is at $95,for a 3 percent loss in stock value.The Jan (07)
100 call will show a loss of about $700,for a 61 percent drop in
value.After a full year,a relatively small drop in the stock price
results in a large loss of value in the LEAPS call,even though
the option still has another year remaining in its lifetime.
You can see these results for Scenario 2 in Figure 6-1 by looking
near the line for 251 days left.
The main lesson to be learned from the preceding example is that a
LEAPS call performs much differently than stock.Ifthe stock performs
well, the LEAPS call will provide a greatly enhanced return. On the
other hand, if the stock price gains little or experiences a small drop
during the first quarter or first half of the LEAPS lifetime, the call
option will perform poorly.The option may even suffer a loss while the
stock makes a small gain,and it can suffer a substantial loss even if the
stock has only a small drop in price.
In the preceding example, no illustration of performance has been
shown when the stock price has fallen by a large amount after 8 months
or 17 months.It is assumed that some stop loss feature is in place for
either the stock or the option that would mitigate that situation. It is
worthwhile,however,to note that if a catastrophic collapse of the stock
price occurs,the dollar amount at risk with 100 shares of stock greatly
exceeds that of one LEAPS call.
As a further illustration of the performance of LEAPS calls in compar-
ison with stock,let’s look at some actual results.On January 15,2004,a
group of 10 long-term options trades were issued to subscribers of The
Options Professor Newsletter (a product of Independent Investor, Inc).
The Options Medley 2004 consisted of 10 LEAPS Jan (05) calls based
on 10 stocks drawn from a broad range of market interests. These
options trades were designed to be aggressive,because they were using
LEAPS that had only a one-year lifetime and whose strike prices were
about 10 percent out-of-the-money.
When it was recommended that the Medley trades be closed on
December 28,2004,the total return was 121 percent,even though not
all ofthe 10 trades were profitable.Here are actual results oftwo trades

from the Medley,selected to illustrate one trade that was profitable and
one that was not.
■ D.R.Horton (DHI).The stock price was at $26 on January 15,
2004,when the Jan (05) 30 call was purchased for $2.80 per
share.On March 3,2004,DHI was at $33,for a 27 percent gain
in the stock price.The LEAPS call was priced at $5.80,for a
gain of 108 percent.By December 28,2004,DHI was near $40,
for a 54 percent gain in the stock price.The LEAPS call was
priced at $9.60,for a gain of 243 percent.
■ Verizon Communications (VZ).The stock price was at $37 on
January 15,2004,when the Jan (05) 40 call was purchased for
$1.70 per share.When this trade was closed on December 28,
2004,VZ was near $41,for an 11 percent gain.The LEAPS call
was priced at $1.20,for a loss of 29 percent.
The Medley concept illustrates an important aspect of using LEAPS
calls instead ofbuying stock.For the same cost as owning 100 shares of
a single stock,it is possible to participate in the price movement of 100
shares of several stocks by buying LEAPS calls, thereby spreading risk
across a diversified portfolio.
Another trading strategy that uses LEAPS calls involves the selling of
front-month premium against the long-term calls.This is similar to the
covered call strategy, which is discussed later in Chapter 14,“Covered
Calls.” In the previous example with the XYZ Jan (07) 100 call, you
could begin by selling the Feb (05) 105 call for $.50 per share, which
brings $50 cash credit into your brokerage account. If this could
berepeated on a month-by-month basis,it would generate $600 over a
12-month period. This would substantially offset the loss situations
described in Scenario 2.Ofcourse,this strategy could lead to situations
in which profit from the upward movement ofthe stock price would be
limited by the short call.
The use of both LEAPS calls and puts is essential to the collar trade
strategy. This strategy is also discussed later in Chapter 18,“Collars,”
and Chapter 19,“Advanced Collars.”

Chapter 6 Leaps

Comments
Some remarks are in order regarding the role ofdividends when LEAPS
calls are used in place ofstock.Unlike owning the stock,the owner ofa
LEAPS call does not receive any dividend distributed by the company.
You must take this into account when comparing the performance of
the option with the stock. In the previous example with XYZ, if the
annual yield from dividends issued to stockholders is less than 1 per-
cent, the performance comparisons shown previously are essentially
unaffected. If XYZ paid annual dividends of 6 percent, however, this
would significantly influence the performance comparison.
