ADVANCED COLLARS
I n this chapter, we consider some variations of the standard collar
trades that were presented in Chapter 18, “Collars.” These varia-
tions do introduce some additional risk with the goal of enhancing
the return.
Let’s consider a variation of Example 1 in Chapter 18 that introduces a
deep-in-the-money call with a high delta as a substitute for stock.
■ Example 1A.In November 2004,you are interested in holding
XYZ stock for the next 14 months.Instead of buying the stock
at $19 per share,the Jan (06) 10 call is used as a substitute for
the stock.The Jan (06) call is priced at $9.60 per share.This
option is a good surrogate for XYZ stock because it has a delta
of .95 and its time value is only $.60 per share [(10.00 + 9.60) –
19.00 = .60].
Trade:Buy 1 Jan (06) 10 call for $9.60 per share as a substitute
for 100 shares of XYZ stock.As before,buy 1 Jan (06) 20 put
for $2.90 per share and sell 1 Jan (06) 25 call for $1.00 per
share.The net cost of the three options is $1,150 [(9.60 +
2.90– 1.00) ×100 = 1,150].
See Figure 19-1 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
For this collar trade,the worst-case scenario is not as simple to
describe,because we have substituted an option for stock.The
maximum loss is incurred at the option’s expiration date if the
stock price is below $20 but above $10,as seen in Figure 19-1.
Inthis situation,the Jan (06) 25 call expires worthless,while the
net value of the Jan (06) 10 call and the Jan (06) 20 put will be

exactly $10 per share.This allows you to cash out those two
options for $1,000,resulting in a loss of $150 [1,150 – 1,000 =
150].This represents a loss of 13 percent of the original
investment.
If the stock price is above $25 at the option’s expiration date,
the Jan (06) 20 put expires worthless.The long Jan (06) 10 call
and the short Jan (06) 25 call constitute a Bull Call Spread with
a value of $1,500 [(25 – 10) ×100 = 1,500].The net profit is
then $350 [1,500 – 1,150 = 350].This represents a gain of
30percent on your original investment.For the 14-month
period that you are in this trade,that translates to a 26 percent
return on an annualized basis.
It is an interesting anomaly of this trade that the largest poten-
tial profit is realized if the stock price is significantly below $10

at the option’s expiration date,as seen in Figure 19-1.Suppose
the XYZ stock price had dropped to $3.Then the Jan (06) 10
call would expire worthless,while the Jan (06) 20 put would be
worth $17 per share.Selling that put for $1,700 [(20 – 3) ×
100= 1,700] results in a profit of $550 [1,700 – 1,150 = 550].
This represents a profit of 48 percent.If the price of XYZ fell
allthe way to 0,the profit would expand to 74 percent.
Let’s consider another variation of Example 1 in Chapter 18
that introduces some short-term riskin an effort to reduce the
cost of the collar.
■ Example 1B.In November 2004,you buy XYZ stock for
$19per share with the intention of holding it for the next
14months.The standard collar trade is amended by also selling
a near-term put to reduce the cost basis of the long-term put.
Trade:Buy 100 shares of XYZ stock for $1,900.Buy 1 Jan (06)
20 put for $2.90 per share and sell 1 Jan (06) 25 call for $1 per
share.Additionally,sell 1 Dec (04) 17.5 put for $.70 per share.
The net cost of the three options is $120 [(2.90 – 1.00 – .70) ×
100 = 120].The net cost for the whole trade is $2,020 [1,900 +
120 = 2,020].
See Figure 19-2 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
The idea here is to collect some short-term premium by selling
the Dec (04) 17.5 put.The Jan (06) put serves as a hedge for
the short Dec (04) 17.5 put in case the stock price falls.Of
course,this means that the Jan (06) put is not fully available to
protect the 100 shares of XYZ stock until the December put
expires in about 6 weeks.The increased downside risk is seen in
Figure 19-2.Under these circumstances,it is wise to initiate a
stop loss order on the stock until the December put expires.
Assuming that the Dec (04) 17.5 put expires worthless,the
original trade then reverts to a standard collar trade with a
reduced cost basis of $2,020.See Figure 19-3 for a risk graph
that depicts that trade.

For this updated collar trade,the worst-case scenario at the
January 2006 option’s expiration is a loss of only $20 [2,020 –
2,000 = 20],as seen in Figure 19-3.This represents a maximum
lossof only 1.0 percent based on the reduced cost of the trade.
The maximum potential profit from the collar trade also bene-
fits from the premium collected from the Dec (04) 17.5 put.If
XYZ is above $25 at the January 2006 option’s expiration,the
net profit is $480 [2,500 – 2,020 = 480].This represents a gain
of 24 percent on the original investment.
Clearly,the drawback to this variation is the six weeks of expo-
sure while waiting for the short Dec (04) 17.5 put to expire.If
the price of XYZ is only slightly below $17.50 at the December
2004 option’s expiration,it may be possible to roll the Dec (04)
17.5 put into the Jan (05) 15 put for a small loss.

Let’s consider another modification of the collar trade that
allows for unlimited profit with only a small increase in the
risk.This strategy requires the purchase of more than
100shares of stock.The idea is to sell fewer calls than corre-
sponds to the total shares of stock owned.This will free up
some shares of stock for unlimited gain.
■ Example 1C.In November 2004,you buy 400 shares of XYZ
stock for $19 per share with the intention of holding it for the
next 14 months.As in the standard collar trade,puts are pur-
chased to protect all 400 shares of the stock.But calls are sold
against only 300 shares of the stock.This combination allows
for 100 shares of stock to remain uncapped by the presence of
ashort call.
Trade:Buy 400 shares of XYZ stock at $19 per share for a total
of $7,600.Buy 4 Jan (06) 20 puts for $2.90 per share and sell 3

Jan (06) 25 calls for $1 per share.The net cost of this trade is
$8,460 [7,600 + (2.90 ×400) – (1.00 ×300) = 8,460.
See Figure 19-4 for a risk graph that depicts this trade.
The worst-case scenario means that the stock price is below $20
on the option’s expiration date.In this situation,the 3 Jan (06)
25 calls expire worthless,while you exercise the 4 Jan (06)
20puts to force someone to buyyour 400 shares of stock at
$20per share.You receive $8,000 from the sale of your stock
and your net loss on the trade is $460 [8,460 – 8,000 = 460].
This represents a loss of 5.4 percent of your original investment.
The best-case scenario for this trade is an unlimited return on
the 100 shares of stock that are uncapped by the short calls.For
example,if the stock price is at $32 on the option’s expiration
date,the 4 Jan (06) 20 puts expire worthless and someone

exercises the 3 Jan (06) 25 call against you,so that 300 shares of
your stock are sold for $25 per share.The remaining 100 shares
of stock can be sold for $3,200.The net profit on the trade is
$2,240 [(25 ×300) + (32 ×100) – 8,460 = 2,240].This repre-
sents a gain of 26 percent on your original investment.For the
14-month period that you are in this trade,that translates to a
23 percent gain on an annualized basis.
It should be noted that the unencumbered 100 shares of stock
can be sold at anytime before the expiration date,if the stock
price has risen sufficiently to warrant that action.If those 100
shares are sold,one of the protective puts is no longer needed
and can be sold for whatever residual value remains.
Comments
The key to understanding the collar trade is the realization that long-
term calls have more time value than comparable long-term puts.And
the more distant the expiration date, the larger is this difference. An
explanation of this disparity in the pricing of call and put options is
given in Chapter 30,“The Put-Call Parity Relationship.” Thus, selling
an out-of-the-money long-term call provides extra cash to offset the
purchase price of an at-the-money put. This explains why short or
intermediate-term collar trades are generally unattractive.
The maximum potential loss on a collar trade is reduced by moving the
strike prices of the call and put options closer together.Unfortunately,
this adjustment also reduces the maximum potential profit.The strike
price of the short call must always exceed that of the long put for a
profit to be possible.
