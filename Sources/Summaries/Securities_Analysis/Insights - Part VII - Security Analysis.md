# Part VII: Discrepancies Between Price and Value
## Insights from Security Analysis by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd

## The Three Root Causes of Market Mispricing

Market errors trace to three fundamental psychological failures: **exaggeration, oversimplification, or neglect**. These are not mechanical failures but human ones—masses of investors making systematic mistakes that create opportunity.

**The market is psychological, not mechanical**: Stock prices result from decisions made in the minds of buyers and sellers, not from automatic value calculations. This psychological nature creates persistent inefficiencies that disciplined analysis can exploit.

## Hard Work: The Only Path to Analytical Discoveries

**"Since we have emphasized that analysis will lead to a positive conclusion only in the exceptional case, it follows that many securities must be examined before one is found that has real possibilities for the analyst. By what practical means does he proceed to make his discoveries? Mainly by hard and systematic work."**

There is no shortcut. The analyst must:
- Conduct systematic comparative analyses across industry groups
- Screen reports as they appear, examining hundreds to find the few compelling opportunities
- Investigate qualitative and quantitative factors thoroughly once statistical anomalies surface

The "Great Illusion" persists—that anyone can get rich in stocks with little effort. This illusion creates opportunity for those willing to do the work others avoid.

---

## Two Systematic Approaches to Finding Opportunities

**Method 1: Comparative industry analysis**
- Compare companies within the same industry group systematically
- Identify those deviating significantly from modal characteristics
- Example: A steel stock earning twice the industry average on market price warrants deep investigation

**Method 2: Continuous report screening**
- Review corporate reports as they appear (daily papers, financial services, Commercial and Financial Chronicle)
- Quick scan of hundreds of reports may reveal 5-10 worth intensive study
- Focus on earnings relative to price and current assets relative to price

**When to use which**: Method 1 works best when you want comprehensive understanding of an industry and relative valuations. Method 2 is more opportunistic—catches special situations as they emerge. Most analysts benefit from combining both approaches.

Both methods require disciplined follow-through: statistical anomalies are starting points, not conclusions. Thorough qualitative investigation must follow.

## Exploiting Cyclical Market Swings: A Practical Framework

Markets repeatedly swing from overvaluation to undervaluation. A disciplined approach:

**The basic method**:
1. Select a diversified list of leading stocks (e.g., Dow Jones Industrial Average)
2. Calculate "normal value" by applying a suitable multiplier to average earnings (e.g., twice the current rate on highest-grade industrial bonds, using 7-10 year average earnings)
3. Make purchases at substantial discount from normal value (e.g., 2/3 of value, or on a scale beginning at 80%)
4. Sell substantially above normal value (e.g., 1/3 higher, or 20-50% higher on a scale)

**Critical limitations**:
- This approach works for **outright owners only**, not margin traders
- Requires enormous patience—you must accept buying too soon and selling too soon
- Human fortitude is the constraining factor: the 1927-1929 bull market would have kept disciplined investors out for years
- Determining "normal earnings" becomes problematic after extraordinary periods

**The margin trader's dilemma**: Margin traders swim with the tide, trying to catch the exact turn. This rarely succeeds—typical experience is temporary success ending in complete disaster. The speculator buys because stocks are going up (not because they're cheap); the analyst buys because stocks are cheap (not because they're going up). This fundamental cleavage of viewpoint makes lasting success in margin trading nearly impossible.

**Why this approach works (when it does)**: It forces purchases at intrinsically attractive levels—more than half the battle in common stock investment.

---

## Opportunities in Secondary and Little-Known Issues

**The persistent pattern**: When market leaders are cheap, secondary issues are often dramatically cheaper. During 1932-1933, stocks like Plymouth Cordage, Pepperell Manufacturing, and American Laundry Machinery sold at unbelievably low prices relative to their records and financial position.

**Individual preference governs**: Should you buy General Motors at 50% of conservative value or Pepperell at 25% of value? Both approaches have merit; the choice depends on temperament and conviction.

**The impermanence of leadership**: Today's market leaders often become tomorrow's neglected issues. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company—one of America's outstanding businesses, the largest retail enterprise in the country—sold below net current assets in 1938. The market can completely abandon former favorites when near-term prospects dim.

---

## What Statistical Undervaluation Looks Like

**Group A: High earnings AND low price relative to assets**
Securities selling at less than 7 times past year's earnings AND less than net current asset value. These combine earnings power with substantial asset protection—the ideal combination for conservative speculation.

**Group B: Compelling asset values with reasonable earnings**
Securities selling at two-thirds or less of net current asset value AND less than 12 times either past year's or average earnings. These emphasize asset protection while requiring some (not spectacular) earning power.

**The analyst's challenge**: Statistical bargains are not difficult to find. What's difficult is determining whether qualitative factors justify following the quantitative indications—whether the company's future justifies confidence that the shares represent a real bargain.

---

## The Vulnerability Trap: Small Company Dynamics

**The downside**: Small companies are vulnerable to sudden, perhaps permanent loss of earning power. This occurs in a larger proportion of cases than among large enterprises.

**The upside**: Successful small companies can multiply in value far more dramatically than giants. Philip Morris grew from $5 million market value (1934) to $90 million (1939)—a 1,700% increase accompanying a 1,200% increase in earnings. This would be inconceivable for American Tobacco.

**Two competing approaches**:
1. Identify potential high-growth winners through careful analysis of future possibilities, then buy even at fairly high prices
2. Buy a diversified group of statistically cheap "bargain issues" with only ordinary prospects

Graham favors the second approach based on long observation, though brilliant results are not guaranteed. The key: avoid commitments when the general market is statistically too high.

---

## Market Behavior Patterns: Standard vs. Nonstandard Issues

**Standard (leading) issues**:
- Respond rapidly to reported profit changes
- Regularly exaggerate the significance of year-to-year fluctuations
- Market efficiency is higher for popular stocks

**Nonstandard (secondary) issues**:
- Behavior depends on attitude of professional operators
- Without interest, price may lag far behind statistical showing
- With interest (manipulative or legitimate), price responds in extreme fashion to changes

**Examples of extremes**:
- Butte & Superior Copper (1915-1916): Earned $33.47 per share, paid $18 dividend, traded between 36-80. Spectacular results met with market indifference due to lack of sponsorship.
- Mullins Body (1927-1928): Moderate earnings improvement drove price from 10 to 95, then back to 10 in 1929. Market operators exploited the stock beyond any reasonable valuation.

**The analyst's boundary**: Once secondary issues fall into market operators' hands, they pass beyond analytical judgment. The stock ceases to be a business and becomes a ticker symbol. The analyst can warn of hazard but cannot predict limits of rise or fall.

---

## Market Exaggeration of Non-Earnings Factors

**Dividend changes**: The market absurdly adds $20 to a stock price because the dividend increases from $5 to $6. The buyer at the higher price pays out in advance all the additional dividends he'll receive over 20 years.

**Stock dividends and splits**: Excited responses to these paper events are even more illogical—they create more shares but give stockholders nothing they didn't have before (except possibly a broader market).

**Mergers and segregations**: Wall Street becomes enthusiastic over mergers (putting two and two together to make five), then equally ebullient over segregations (splitting five into three and three). Inductive studies cast doubt on whether consolidation actually aids earning power. Personal elements in management often prevent truly advantageous combinations.

**The speculator's psychology**: He wants "action" and will contribute to it given any pretext. Stock dividends and similar developments supply desired pretexts. The whole thing would be childish if it weren't so vicious. The analyst should understand these absurdities but avoid any contact with them.

---

## Litigation: Wall Street's Disproportionate Fear

**The principle**: Lawsuits of any significance severely dampen securities prices, often far beyond the merits of the case. This creates opportunity.

**The mathematical anomaly**: A remote claim that plaintiffs regard as having scarcely any real value becomes equivalent in the market to a heavy liability for defendants. A claim with perhaps 5% probability of success might depress bonds by 15 points—a demonstrable case of undervaluation.

**Why it works**: Those exploiting this arbitrage can assess probabilities quantitatively while the market reacts qualitatively (avoiding all litigation-touched securities regardless of merit).

**Example—Island Oil and Transport 8% Notes (1933)**: Sold at 18 when receiver held cash equivalent to 45% of issue. Litigation delaying distribution (repeatedly unsuccessful, approaching final determination) depressed market value out of all proportion to merits. Litigation could have been settled for relatively small amount. After final favorable decision, noteholders received $290 per $1,000 in April 1934.

**The Reading Company paradox (1913-1921)**: Government suit to force separation of railroad and coal properties depressed Reading stock despite segregation itself being typically "bullish." When separation plan was agreed (a government victory), the market hailed it as favorable. Common stockholders then sued to restrict coal company rights to common only—this new litigation depressed the common even though logically it should have advanced (if successful, more value for common; if failed, no change). The market reasons: "litigation = avoid the security," regardless of logic.

---

## Receivership Patterns: Consistent Undervaluation of Senior Securities

**The general rule**: Where substantial values are ultimately realized from receivership, senior securities will have sold at prices far too low. This has two consequences:

1. **Before receivership**: Don't buy at investment levels any securities likely to fall into financial difficulties
2. **After receivership arises**: Attractive analytical opportunities often emerge

This holds true not only for strongly entrenched issues that emerge unscathed but also for senior securities that are "scaled down" in reorganization. It holds most consistently when liquidation or sale to outside interests results in cash distribution.

**Typical price patterns during insolvency**:
- Stock issues tend to sell too high (relatively and absolutely) due to speculative interest attracted by seemingly low prices
- Senior issues see declining popular interest and falling prices as proceedings drag on
- Lowest levels for senior issues typically reached shortly before reorganization plan announcement
- This pattern creates a predictable (if imprecise) buying opportunity

**The analyst's approach**: Keep close touch with such situations, seeking securities selling far under intrinsic value. Determine approximately (not precisely) the best time for commitment. Time is a subordinate consideration in security analysis—allow leeway of several months or even longer in judging the "right time."

**The broader lesson**: This principle extends beyond formal receivership. Whenever financial distress creates forced selling or fear-driven avoidance, senior securities with strong underlying support often become severely undervalued. The key is identifying situations where asset values, earnings of specific divisions, or reorganization plans provide quantifiable support far exceeding market prices.

---

## Seasoned vs. Unseasoned Issues: Opposite Market Patterns

**Seasoned issues (long and favorably known)**:
- Price often maintained despite considerable weakening of investment position
- Investors buy by reputation rather than analysis
- Holders don't sell readily; small declines attract buyers familiar with the security

**Example—U.S. Rubber 8% Noncumulative Preferred (1905-1929)**:
- Received full dividends 1905-1927; investors paid above par almost every year
- Statistical exhibit inadequate even for an industrial bond, much less a noncumulative preferred
- 1922-1927: Interest and preferred dividends covered only 1.00-1.79 times
- 1928: Company sustained enormous loss, preferred dividend discontinued
- 1929: Despite no dividend and miserable showing, stock still sold at 92½ (fell to 3⅛ in 1932)

**Unseasoned issues (recently issued industrials)**:
- Unduly sensitive to adverse developments
- Price often falls too low relative to statistical exhibit
- Generally lack dominant size (an important disadvantage in industrials)

**The practical rule for unseasoned industrial senior issues**:
- Rarely deserve an investment rating
- Should only be bought on admittedly speculative basis (price below 70)
- Don't buy in the 70-100 range even with satisfactory quantitative showing
- Exception: Extraordinarily strong statistical exhibit may justify purchase above 70 (rare)
- No exceptions for unseasoned industrial preferred stocks (contractual weakness makes them too vulnerable)

---

## Price Discrepancies in Related Securities

**When exchange recommendations are appropriate**:
1. The issue to be bought is attractive in its own right, OR
2. There exists a definite contractual relationship between the two issues

**The contractual advantage**: When securities are legally related (guaranteed issues, convertibles vs. common, bonds vs. stock of same company), relative mispricing is mathematically demonstrable. The analyst need not assume responsibility for the situation itself—only for recognizing which security offers better terms.

**Common pattern**: Speculative markets concentrate attention on common stocks and neglect senior securities. This creates exploitable price discrepancies between senior and junior issues of the same company.

**Comparing nonconvertible preferred vs. common stock**: Common often sells too high relative to preferred when both are speculative. Safe comparisons require cumulative dividends (don't use noncumulative preferred due to severe disabilities).

**The intermediate prosperity argument**: Even if extraordinary prosperity might eventually make common worth more than preferred, the company must pass through an intermediate period when improved conditions permit resumption of preferred dividends, then discharge of accumulations. These developments benefit preferred directly and likely establish market values for preferred far higher than common—at least temporarily. Therefore, assuming appreciable improvement, preferred purchased at low levels should fare better than common.

---

## The Special Responsibility of Exchange Recommendations

Recommending exchange of one security for another involves greater personal accountability than selecting issue for original purchase.

**Why greater accountability**:
- Investment holders are loath to make changes and particularly irritated if subsequent market action makes move appear unwise
- Speculative holders gauge all advice by test of immediate market results

**Practical guidelines**:
- Avoid suggesting common-stock exchanges to speculators (except with emphatic disclaimer of responsibility for market action)
- Hesitate to suggest exchanges to investors unless statistical superiority quite impressive
- **Arbitrary rule**: Should be good reason to believe the exchange would get investor at least 50% more for his money

## New Enterprise Financing: The Excessive Cost of Going Public

**The three-part cost structure** (using Petroleum Corporation of America, 1929, as example):

Stock buyers paid $34 per share; company received $31. For this $3 difference plus control, buyers received:

1. **Underwriting spread**: $3 per share (9% of capital raised)
2. **Option warrants to organizers**: 1,625,000 warrants to buy shares at $34 (one warrant for every two shares sold). Price relationships suggest these took one-sixth of value—about 17% of cash capital
3. **Future management salaries and corporate overhead**

**Total**: 25-30% of public's contribution absorbed before operations begin.

**What was received for this cost?**
- Directors not obligated to devote themselves preponderantly to the enterprise
- Limited scope for judgment (specialized in petroleum only, essentially became holding company)
- Management value greatly diminished by multiple simultaneous claims on their time

**Investment bankers' standards: the critical shift**

**Pre-1920s reputable practice required**:
1. Enterprise must be well-established with adequate record
2. Investment banker acts as buyers' representative, dealing at arm's length with management
3. Banker compensation must be reasonable

**Established Wall Street maxim**: Capital for new enterprises must be raised from private sources who could investigate thoroughly, work out their own deals, keep close touch—all safeguards necessary to justify new venture commitment.

**Investment trust financing (late 1920s) contravened all three criteria**: Trusts were new enterprises; management and bankers were identical; compensation determined by recipients without accepted standards. Without arm's-length bargaining, security buyers' interests weren't adequately protected.

**Graham's considered conclusion**: "The nation's interest would be served by amending the Securities Act so as to prohibit the public offering of securities of new and definitely unseasoned ventures."

**Reasoning**: New venture capital is essential to progress, but no substantial contribution to national upbuilding has ever been made by new ventures publicly financed. Leading banking houses won't engage in such offerings (not reputable). Less fastidious channels exact such high selling costs that the new enterprise's small chance of success is greatly diminished.

**The modern adaptation** (post-1933): Promoters select real enterprises that can be sold at much more than fair value. By disclosing facts and avoiding false representations, they obey the law while exploiting the public. Full disclosure, while desirable, provides little practical help except to skilled analysts—the typical buyer neither reads long prospectuses carefully nor understands all implications.

**Management compensation repercussions**: Relaxed investment banker standards had unwholesome effects on corporate management. Operating officials felt entitled to both handsome salaries and substantial profit participation. Stock-option warrants proved excellent for securing large bonuses without full disclosure: "The public's failure to comprehend that all the value of option warrants is derived at the expense of the common stock has led to a practice that would be ridiculous if it were not so mischievous."

## Corporate Pyramiding: Control Without Capital

**Definition**: Creation of speculative capital structure through holding companies, enabling organizers to control large businesses with little or no capital while securing to themselves the major part of surplus profits.

**The Van Sweringen example**: Starting with 1916 purchase of Nickel Plate control ($2 million borrowed cash, $6.5 million note), they created a far-flung railroad empire. By 1930:

- **Chesapeake & Ohio Railway**: 54.4% control, only 1.0% equity
- **Erie Railroad**: 30.8% control, only 0.6% equity
- **Missouri Pacific**: 50.5% control, only 1.7% equity

**Historical amnesia**: Rock Island Company (1902) used identical technique—by 1915 both holding companies went bankrupt, stock issues wiped out. This 1915 collapse was accepted as marking the end of "high finance" in railroads. Yet ten years later the same practices were reintroduced on a larger scale with severer losses. "The memory of the financial community is proverbially and distressingly short."

---

## The Four Evils of Pyramiding

**1. Creation of unsound senior securities**: Large amounts sold to investors that don't meet safety standards.

**2. Deceptive leverage in holding company common stocks**: Rapid increases during favorable years become vehicles for wild speculation.

**3. Inequitable control structure**: Control by those with no real capital investment makes for irresponsible, unsound policies.

**4. Financial practices that exaggerate reported results**:
- Valuing stock dividends from subsidiaries at unduly high prices
- Including profits from sale of subsidiary stock at inflated intercorporate prices
- Creating artificial "earnings" through transactions with own shareholders

**Example—American Founders Trust (1927)**: Offered shareholders privilege to buy subsidiary stock at $16 per share that parent had acquired at $3.70. Most of reported 1927 earnings created by own stockholders through these purchases.

**Book value manipulation**: When holding company owns most subsidiary shares, artificially high quotation established for small amount remaining in market, then used to figure holding company "book value."

**Electric Bond & Share / American & Foreign Power (1929)**: Most extraordinary example. Small common issue received price ignoring warrants; this high price for small common created high value for millions of warrants; Electric Bond & Share applied these inflated values to its large holdings. Result: Earnings of $6.5 million transmuted into market value of $1,560 million—over 80% from warrant values "industriously exploited to justify higher quotations."

**Not all holding companies are reprehensible**: Legitimate uses include unified operations, diversification, technical advantages. U.S. Steel, AT&T, General Motors—all predominantly holding companies with sound financial structures.

## Comparative Analysis: Using Industry Context

**Purpose**: Systematic tabulation permits studying each company against industry background, highlighting those deviating widely from modal characteristics.

**Critical principle—don't compare different capitalization structures**: Cannot draw conclusions about relative attractiveness when one company is speculatively and the other conservatively capitalized. They respond entirely differently to changes, so advantage under current conditions may be lost if conditions change.

**Union Pacific vs. Rock Island (1922-1933) example**:
- 1922: Union Pacific earned 4× more on market price than Rock Island, but comparison was fallacious due to capitalization differences
- 1922-1927 (moderate improvement): Rock Island earnings increased 1,158% vs. Union Pacific 26%
- 1927-1933 (depression): Rock Island went bankrupt, Union Pacific survived
- Lesson: Speculative capitalization magnifies both gains and losses—comparing across structures is comparing apples to oranges

**Industry homogeneity determines comparative analysis value**:

**Homogeneous groups** (past performance reliable guide):
- Producers of raw materials and standardized products where trade names are minor
- Larger oil, baking, dairy, packing, and chain-store enterprises within same subgroups
- Railroads and larger utilities (with exceptions for traffic/geographic variations)

**Heterogeneous groups** (past performance less reliable):
- Manufacturers of goods sold under advertised trade-marks
- One concern frequently prospers at competitors' expense
- Automobiles, machinery, equipment, proprietary drugs
- Less homogeneous the group, more attention must be paid to qualitative factors

**Key comparative metrics priority**:
1. Percentage earned on total capitalization (reveals true profitability of enterprise)
2. Percentage earned on market price of common stock (reveals market valuation)
3. Ratio of sales to market value of common (reveals capitalization structure leverage)

Don't rely on common stock earnings ratio being higher than industry average unless percentage earned on total capitalization is also higher.

**Essential follow-up**: Conclusions suggested by statistical comparisons should not be accepted until careful thought given to qualitative factors. Valid reasons for disparity may include poorer outlook, questionable management, or factors statistics don't disclose. Relative popularity and market activity exert powerful effects on quotations—analyst must give these respectful heed but work would be stultified if always favoring more active and popular issues.

---

## Market Analysis vs. Security Analysis: The Fundamental Difference

**Market analysis definition**: Activities aimed at forecasting security price movements, whether general market averages or individual issues, near-term or longer-term.

**Two types of market analysis**:

**Type 1: Chart reading (technical analysis)**
- Finds material for predictions exclusively in past market action
- "The market is its own best forecaster"
- Dow theory best-known method

**Type 2: Eclectic approach**
- Considers economic factors: business conditions, money rates, political outlook
- Market behavior only one of numerous elements studied

---

## The Fatal Flaws of Chart Reading

**Why it cannot be a science**: If chart reading were science with dependable conclusions, everyone could predict price changes and make money continuously. This is impossible. No such thing as scientific prediction of economic events under human control can exist—the very "dependability" of prediction causes human actions that invalidate it. Therefore, continued success depends on keeping successful methods known to only a few.

**Why no method has been continuously successful**: If generally known method existed, numberless traders would adopt it—this very following would bring its usefulness to end.

**The faulty logic**:
- Premise: Market action reflects activities and attitude of those interested
- Conclusion: Therefore, by studying market action, we can tell what happens next
- Flaw: Premise may be true, but conclusion doesn't necessarily follow

**The horse-racing analogy**: "Past performances" afford considerable information and often enable picking the winner—but don't furnish valuable information often enough to make betting profitable.

**Similarity to security analysis**: Both deal with data not conclusive as to future. The difference: securities analyst can protect himself by margin of safety, denied to market analyst.

**Why advantages diminish**: As methods gain popularity, loss amounts increase and profits diminish. When more people following same system receive signals simultaneously, competitive buying results in higher average prices paid; conversely for selling.

Intelligent chart students recognize these weaknesses and view market forecasting as an art requiring talent, judgment, intuition, and personal qualities—admitting that no automatic rules can insure success.

---

## Mechanical Forecasting: The Time Element Problem

**The approach**: Construct indices representing economic factors (money rates, carloadings, steel production), deduce impending market changes from recent changes in these indices.

**Representative characteristics**: (1) Sounds vaguely plausible on basis of reasoning, (2) Relies for convincingness on fact it has "worked" for number of years past.

**Necessary weakness**: The time element. Easy and safe to prophesy that high interest rates will lead to sharp market decline. The question is "How soon?" There is no scientific way of answering this question.

**The pseudo-science trap**: Forecasting services take for granted that certain time lags or coincidences from the past can be counted upon to occur in much the same way in future.

**Conclusion**: Endeavor to forecast security-price changes by mechanical indices is open to same objections as chart reading. Not truly scientific because there's no convincing reasoning to support them, and really scientific (entirely dependable) forecasting in economic field is a logical impossibility.

---

## Security Analysis: Three Critical Advantages

Both security analysis and market analysis are arts requiring talent and ability. But security analysis has advantages likely to make it more successful:

**1. Margin of safety protection**

Security analysis: Prime stress on protection against untoward events, obtained by insisting upon margins of safety—values well in excess of price paid. Even if security turns out less attractive than appeared, commitment might still prove satisfactory.

Market analysis: No margins of safety. You're either right or wrong, and if wrong, you lose money.

**Professional analogy**: A talented lawyer should make respectable living; a merely talented musician faces heartbreaking obstacles to concert career. Similarly, thoroughly competent securities analyst should obtain satisfactory results, whereas permanent success as market analyst requires unusual qualities—or unusual luck.

**2. Cost of operations**

Market analysis: Cardinal rule (cut losses short, safeguard profits by selling when decline commences) leads to active trading. Cost of buying and selling becomes heavily adverse factor in aggregate results.

Security analysis: Operations ordinarily of investment type, don't involve active trading.

**3. Nature of competition**

Market analysis: Essentially a battle of wits. Profits realized at expense of others trying to do same thing. Trader favors active issues where price changes result from activities of numerous competitors. Market analyst can succeed only if more clever or luckier than competitors.

Security analysis: Work not similarly competitive with fellow analysts. In typical case, issue selected for purchase is not sold by someone who made equally painstaking analysis. Security analyst examines far larger list, selecting exceptional cases where market price falls far short of reflecting intrinsic value through neglect or undue emphasis on probably temporary unfavorable factors.

**The deceptive appearance**: "Market analysis seems easier than security analysis, and its rewards may be realized much more quickly. For these very reasons, it is likely to prove more disappointing in the long run. There are no dependable ways of making money easily and quickly, either in Wall Street or anywhere else."

---

## Prophesies Based on Near-term Prospects: A Flawed Approach

**The common practice**: Large part of financial district analysis rests upon near-term business prospects. Assumed that if outlook favors increased earnings, issue should be bought expecting higher price when larger profits are reported.

**Why this theory is too simple**:
Its weakness: Current market price already takes into account consensus of opinion as to future prospects. In many cases prospects will have been given more than their just recognition.

**The twofold hazard**:
1. Forecast of next year's results may prove incorrect
2. Even if correct, may have been discounted or overdiscounted in current price

**The missing correlation**: If markets reflected only this year's earnings, good estimate of next year's results would be invaluable. But premise is not correct—difficult to establish definite correlation between fluctuations in earnings and market quotations (excluding extreme periods).

---

## The Four Proper Fields for Positive Analytical Conclusions

Graham is skeptical of analyst's ability to forecast market behavior of individual issues over near-term based on technical position, general business outlook, or specific company outlook. More satisfactory results obtained by confining positive conclusions to:

**1. Selection of standard senior issues meeting exacting tests of safety**
Fixed-value investments where margin of safety can be demonstrated quantitatively.

**2. Discovery of senior issues meriting investment rating but also having opportunities of appreciable enhancement in value**
Privileged senior issues combining adequate security with promising conversion or similar right (rare but not unknown).

**3. Discovery of common stocks or speculative senior issues appearing to sell at far less than intrinsic value**
Intrinsic value takes into account not only past earnings and liquid asset values but also future earning power, conservatively estimated—qualitative as well as quantitative elements.

**4. Determination of definite price discrepancies between related securities**
Situations that may justify making exchanges or initiating hedging or arbitrage operations.

## Investment Policy Summary: For Different Investor Types

### A. The Investor of Small Means

**1. Investment for Income**
Only sensible investment for safety and accumulated income: **United States Savings Bonds**. Other good investments yield little more and lack equal protection. Straight bonds and preferred stocks ostensibly offering higher return almost certain to involve appreciable risk. Various "savings plans" offered by salesmen are full of pitfalls.

**2. Investment for Profit—Four Approaches**

**a. Purchase representative common stocks when market level clearly low by objective, long-term standards**
Requires patience and courage; not free from possibility of miscalculation; over long period, will show good results.

**b. Purchase individual issues with special growth possibilities when obtainable at reasonable prices in relation to actual accomplishment**
Where growth generally expected, price rarely reasonable. If basis is confidence in future growth not held by public, may prove sound and profitable—or may prove ill-founded and costly.

**c. Purchase well-secured privileged senior issues**
Combination of really adequate security with promising conversion or similar right is rare but not unknown. Policy of careful selection should bring good results; requires patience and persistence.

**d. Purchase securities selling well below intrinsic value**
Since large percentage of issues nowadays relatively unpopular, must be many cases where market goes clearly astray. May be found in bonds, preferred stocks, and common stocks.

**Essential caveat**: Small investor practicing security analysis nonprofessionally (requires better than average intelligence and training) should submit ideas to criticism of professional analyst. Unless qualified to advise others professionally, should not, unaided, prescribe for himself.

**3. Speculation—Three Types**

**a. Buying stock in new or virtually new ventures**
**Emphatic condemnation**: Odds so strongly against buyer that he might as well throw three-quarters of money out window.

**b. Trading in the market**
Graham's skeptical opinion: Regardless of preparation and method, success in trading is either accidental and impermanent or due to highly uncommon talent. Vast majority inevitably doomed to failure.

**Basic distinction**: Purchasing stocks at objectively low levels and selling at high levels = investment. Buying when market "expected" to advance and selling when "due" to decline = speculation.

**c. Purchase of "growth stocks" at generous prices**
Graham considers this inherently dangerous and increasingly so as it becomes more popular. But chances of individual success much brighter here than in other speculation forms—better field for exercise of foresight, judgment, and moderation.

### B. The Individual Investor of Large Means

**Three special handicaps** despite technical advantages:

1. Cannot solve investment problem with U.S. Savings Bonds alone (purchase limits). Must consider broader fixed-value field. Strict quantitative tests plus good qualitative judgment should afford satisfactory result.

2. Inflation problem more serious. Since 1932, strong argument for some common-stock holdings as defensive measure. Additionally, substantial common stock holding corresponds with traditional practice of wealthy individuals.

3. Size of investment unit more likely to induce concentration on popular and active issues, handicapping undervalued-security technique application. However, more serious obstacle likely found in his preferences and prejudices.

### C. Investment by Business Corporations

**Graham's belief**: U.S. government bonds carrying corporate income tax exemption are almost the only logical medium for business funds that may properly be invested for term of years. Other types of investments can offer appreciably higher return only at risk of loss and criticism.

### D. Institutional Investment

**Graham's hesitancy**: Won't presume to suggest policies for financial institutions. Final observation: An institution that can manage on low income from high-grade fixed-value issues should confine holdings to this field. Doubt that better performance of common-stock indexes over past periods will, in itself, warrant heavy responsibilities and recurring uncertainties inseparable from common-stock programs.

**Possible modifications**:
- If substantial unanimity that inflation must be guarded against, OR
- If insufficiency of income compels search for higher return

May be warranted to set aside portion of funds for administration in other than fixed-value fields, in accordance with canons and technique of security analysis.

## The Enduring Principle: Margin of Safety

The fundamental difference between security analysis and market analysis lies in protection against error:

**Security analysis**: Prime stress laid upon protection against untoward events, obtained by insisting upon margins of safety—values well in excess of price paid. The underlying idea: even if security turns out less attractive than appeared, the commitment might still prove satisfactory.

**Market analysis**: No margins of safety exist. You are either right or wrong, and if you are wrong, you lose money.

This single principle explains why security analysis offers the disciplined investor a more durable path to investment success than attempting to forecast price movements.
