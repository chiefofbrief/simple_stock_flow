# Insights - Part VI: Balance Sheet Analysis & Asset Values
## Security Analysis by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd

## Core Philosophy: Why the Balance Sheet Matters

**Four fundamental uses of balance sheet analysis**:
1. **Capital deployment visibility**: Shows how much capital is invested and what resources support returns—a competitive enterprise without resources cannot expect significant profits
2. **Earnings sustainability check**: Resources provide the basis for analyzing stability of income sources. Earnings well above asset-based returns attract competition and rarely continue indefinitely; businesses earning below normal returns may improve as competition withdraws
3. **Financial condition assessment**: Liabilities reveal financial distress risk—high short-term debt or near-term maturities can cause permanent value loss even from slight profit impairment
4. **Earnings quality verification**: Balance sheet evolution over time checks income statement validity

**The balance sheet advantage**: Form is better standardized than income statements, offering fewer grounds for criticism. Assets and liabilities can be checked for accuracy at a particular moment, placing significant constraints on manipulation. Flow variables (revenue, earnings) are by nature transient and must be monitored over extended periods—this fundamental difference accounts for superior reliability of balance sheet figures.

## Book Value: When It Matters and When It Doesn't

### The Forgotten Metric

**Historical significance, modern neglect**: Book value was originally the most important element in a stock's financial exhibit, intended to show "the value" like a merchant's balance sheet. This idea has almost completely disappeared—largely because (1) stated values frequently bore no relationship to actual cost, and (2) stated values bore no relationship to market value or earnings-justified value.

### Financial Reasoning vs. Business Reasoning

**The widened rift**: Wall Street never asks, "How much is the business selling for?" Yet this should be the first question. A businessman offered 5% of a concern for $10,000 would multiply by 20 to establish a $200,000 valuation for the entire undertaking, then ask whether the business is a "good buy" at $200,000. This elementary approach has been practically abandoned by stock purchasers.

**The fundamental recommendation**: Let the stock buyer know, first, what value he is actually setting on the business and, second, what he is getting for his money in terms of tangible resources. Examine this testimony before rejecting it.

### The Competitive Dynamics

**Presumptions in both directions**: A business selling at a premium does so because it earns large returns on capital—this attracts competition and generally won't continue indefinitely. Conversely, a business selling at large discount due to abnormally low earnings benefits from absence of new competition, withdrawal of old competition, and natural economic forces that may eventually restore normal profit rates.

**The nuanced reality**: Under modern conditions, "intangibles" (goodwill, efficient organization) are as real from a dollars-and-cents standpoint as buildings and machinery. Earnings based on intangibles may be even less vulnerable to competition than those requiring only cash investment in facilities. When conditions are favorable, the enterprise with small capital investment often shows more rapid growth—it can expand sales and profits at slight expense.

**No fixed rules, but conscious awareness**: No specific rules about book value in relation to market price are reasonable, except the strong recommendation that purchasers know what they're doing on this score and be satisfied they're acting sensibly.

## Current-Asset Value and Liquidation Analysis

### Three Measures of Asset Protection

**Book value** = Tangible assets minus all liabilities and senior claims

**Current-asset value** = Current assets alone minus all liabilities and senior claims (excludes fixed and miscellaneous assets)

**Cash-asset value** = Cash assets (cash, certificates of deposit, call loans, marketable securities at market, insurance cash surrender value) minus all liabilities and senior claims

### Liquidating Value: The Foundation

**What it means**: Liquidating value means the money owners could get out if they wanted to give it up—either selling to someone else on going-concern basis or converting assets to cash piecemeal over whatever time needed to obtain best realization from each.

**Relative dependability of assets in liquidation** (rough averages of liquidating value to book value):
- Cash assets: 100%
- Receivables (less usual reserves): 80%
- Inventories (at lower of cost or market): 66⅔%
- Fixed and miscellaneous assets: ~15% (range 1–50%)
- Retail installment accounts: ~50% (range 30–60%)

**The general rule**: Current-asset value affords a rough measure of liquidating value. In typical cases, noncurrent assets realize enough to make up most of the shrinkage suffered in liquidating current assets.

### The Below-Liquidation-Value Phenomenon

**A distinctive market feature**: During 1931–1933, over 40% of all industrial companies listed on the NYSE quoted at some time at less than their net current assets. A considerable number sold for less than cash-asset value. The typical American corporation was apparently worth more dead than alive.

This situation repeated on smaller scale in 1937–1938: 20.5% of industrial companies sold in early 1938 at less than net-current-asset value.

**Why it happened**: This was direct outgrowth of the new-era doctrine which transferred all tests of value to the income account and completely ignored the balance sheet. Companies without current earnings were regarded as having very little real value, likely to sell for merest fraction of realizable resources.

### The Logical Principle

**The central tenet**: When a common stock sells persistently below its liquidating value, then either (1) the price is too low or (2) the company should be liquidated. On either premise, a price below liquidating value is unjustifiable.

**Two corollaries**:
1. Such a price should impel stockholders to question whether it's in their interest to continue the business
2. Such a price should impel management to take all proper steps to correct the obvious disparity between market quotation and intrinsic value, including reconsideration of its own policies and frank justification to stockholders of its decision to continue the business

## Investment Opportunities: Stocks Below Liquidating Value

### Why These Situations Occur

Stocks selling below liquidating value practically always have unsatisfactory earnings trends. The objection to buying lies in the probability that earnings will decline or losses continue, resources will be dissipated, and intrinsic value will ultimately become less than the price paid.

### Paths to Value Realization

**A much wider range of favorable developments can establish higher market price**:

1. **Creation of earning power commensurate with assets**: General improvement in the industry, or favorable change in operating policies (more efficient methods, new products, abandonment of unprofitable lines)

2. **Sale or merger**: Some other concern can utilize the resources to better advantage and hence can pay at least liquidating value for the assets

3. **Complete or partial liquidation**

**Historical evidence**: Liquidation or sale of unprofitable companies holding substantial assets (particularly current assets) is almost certain to realize considerably more than the previously existing market price. The market price is governed chiefly by earnings, whereas proceeds of liquidation depend upon assets.

### Discrimination Required

**Essential analytical requirements**:
- **Lean toward imminent favorable developments**: Visible prospect of one of the favorable developments listed above
- **Or seek other attractive statistical features**: Satisfactory current earnings and dividends, or high average earning power in the past
- **Avoid rapid dissipation**: Companies losing current assets at rapid rate with no definite signs of cessation

**The balance sheet comparison test**: Compare balance sheets over time to distinguish companies strengthening versus weakening their position:
- **Favorable pattern**: Current-asset value maintained or strengthened despite depression losses (e.g., liquidating receivables and inventories to pay off bank loans and increase cash)
- **Unfavorable pattern**: Rapid dissipation of current assets, particularly cash assets, with losses continuing

**Market timing considerations**: Investment in bargain issues needs some regard for general market conditions. Avoid buying cheap stocks when the market as a whole seems much higher than it should be (ensuing decline likely to bear severely even on neglected issues) or when all stocks are very cheap (then just as much reason to buy undervalued leading issues). Best environment: neither extremely high nor extremely low price levels.

## The Superior Safety Logic

### Ownership vs. Limited Claims

**The fundamental comparison**: A common stock representing entire business ownership cannot be less safe than a bond having claim to only part thereof. A common stock cannot be less safe intrinsically than it would be if it were a bond—if instead of representing full ownership, it were given fixed and limited claim with some new common stock created to own what was left.

**Example logic**: With identical management, if a stock investment has 180% in assets behind it while bonds are protected by only 122% in assets, and the stock represents entire ownership of company's assets while bonds' interest is limited to principal amount (balance belonging to junior holders), the stock is more attractive than the bonds at quoted prices.

**The form vs. essence distinction**: Those who consider the bond issue "safer" than stock selling below its liquidating value are being misled by form into overlooking essence. Yet something remains regarding effect of diverse forms: bonds carry assurance of continued income (interest must be paid or company faces insolvency), and special efforts will be made to pay them off at or before maturity. These contractual obligations do not apply to stockholders—but this reflects management's failure to recognize realities and protect stockholders, not inherent superiority of bonds.

## Stockholder-Management Relationships

### The Apathy Problem

**The notorious fact**: The typical American stockholder is the most docile and apathetic animal in captivity. He does what the board of directors tells him to do and rarely thinks of asserting his individual rights as owner of the business and employer of its paid officers. The result: effective control of many (perhaps most) large American corporations is exercised not by those who together own a majority of stock but by a small group known as "the management."

### Three Plausible But Partly Fallacious Assumptions

1. **Management knows more than stockholders, therefore its judgment on all policy matters is to be accepted**
   - Often true that management is in best position to judge which policies are most expedient
   - Does NOT follow that it will always recognize or adopt the course most beneficial to shareholders
   - May err grievously through incompetence
   - Should not stockholders be open-minded on whether management is efficient or the reverse?

2. **Management has no interest in or responsibility for prices at which company's securities sell**
   - Basically wrong and thoroughly hypocritical
   - Marketability of securities is chief quality considered in purchase
   - Marketability presupposes not only place to sell but opportunity to sell at fair price
   - Management responsibility to act in shareholders' interest includes obligation to prevent absurdly high or unduly low prices

3. **If a stockholder disapproves of any major policy, his proper move is to sell his stock**
   - Avoids the real ownership responsibility

### Conflicts of Interest

**Areas where officers' and stockholders' interests may conflict**:
1. Compensation to officers (salaries, bonuses, stock options)
2. Expansion of business (officers gain larger salaries, more power and prestige)
3. Payment of dividends (should money earned remain under management control or pass to stockholders?)
4. Continuance of stockholders' investment (should business continue though unprofitable, or should capital be withdrawn/wound up completely?)
5. Information to stockholders (should those in control benefit through having information not given to stockholders generally?)

**The scrutiny requirement**: On all these questions, management decisions are interested decisions and require scrutiny by stockholders. Officers of large corporations constitute a group above average in probity and ability—but they should not be given carte blanche in matters affecting their own interests.

**The director problem**: Directors theoretically represent stockholders' interests when opposed to officers' interests. But in practice this cannot be counted upon—in many companies a majority (in most companies a substantial part) of the board is composed of paid officials. Directors who aren't officers are frequently joined by many close ties to chief executives.

### The Liquidation Question

**A fundamental ownership issue**: The question whether a business should be continued is one that may deserve independent thought by proprietors (the stockholders). This is by its formal nature an ownership problem, not a management problem. A logical reason for addressing this question arises precisely from the fact that stock has long been selling considerably below liquidating value—this situation must mean either (1) the market is wrong in its valuation or (2) the management is wrong in keeping the enterprise alive.

**Management's conflicted position**: Managements are naturally loath to return any part of capital to owners, even though capital may be far more useful outside the business than in it. Returning capital means curtailing resources, perhaps creating financial problems later, certainly reducing prestige of officers. Complete liquidation means loss of the job itself.

**Corrective measures available to management**:
1. **Call attention officially** to fact that liquidating value is substantially higher than market price; if continuance preferable to liquidation, supply the reasons
2. **Establish proportionate dividend rate**: Special endeavor to establish dividend rate proportionate at least to liquidating value, so stockholders don't suffer income loss through keeping business alive (may be done even if current earnings insufficient, provided accumulated profits and cash position are strong)
3. **Return unneeded cash capital**: Through pro rata distribution (usually with par value reduction) or through offer to purchase shares pro rata at fair price
4. **Consider sale or winding up**: Careful consideration may lead to conclusion that sale or winding up is the most sensible corrective step

### The Abuse of Open-Market Share Repurchases

**The vicious elements**:
- Stock bought in open market without notice to shareholders
- Thought to be "in interest of corporation" to acquire stock at lowest possible price
- Stockholders who sell back to company are made to suffer as large loss as possible for presumable benefit of those who hold on
- No warrant in logic or ethics for applying this viewpoint to acquisition of shares from company's own stockholders
- Desire to buy back shares cheaply may lead to determination to reduce or pass dividend, especially in times of general uncertainty

**The proper alternative**: Employ excess cash capital to repurchase pro rata at reasonable price. This is logical when contraction in business makes additional capital no longer necessary. The market heavily discounts value of cash when held by company instead of by individual shareholders—particularly for rank-and-file stockholders who cannot force distribution.

## Working Capital Analysis

### Basic Standards

**The 2-to-1 standard**: Minimum of $2 of current assets for $1 of current liabilities was formerly regarded as standard for industrial companies. Since late 1920s, most industrial corporations show ratio well in excess of 2 to 1.

**The acid test**: Current assets exclusive of inventories should at least equal current liabilities. Ordinarily investor might expect a company to meet both the 2-to-1 test and the acid test.

**The exception requirement**: As in all arbitrary rules, exceptions must be allowed if justified by special circumstances. Seasonal borrowings, temporary needs related to profitable new business, and industry-specific working capital patterns may justify apparent violations.

### Danger Signals

**Large bank debt frequently a sign of weakness**: Financial difficulties are almost always heralded by presence of bank loans or other debt due in short time. Rare for weak financial position to be created solely by ordinary trade accounts payable. Whenever statement shows Notes or Bills Payable, analyst should subject financial picture to closer scrutiny.

**Early maturing funded debt**: Large bond issue coming due in short time constitutes critical financial problem when operating results are unfavorable. Frequent cause of insolvency. Even when maturing debt can probably be taken care of somehow, possible cost of refinancing must be taken into account.

**Intercorporate indebtedness**: Current debt to parent or affiliated company is theoretically as serious as any other short-term liability, but in practice rarely made basis of embarrassing claim for payment. Conservative buyer would naturally prefer to see obligations to affiliates in some form other than current liability.

## Balance Sheet Comparison Over Time

### Three Analytical Aspects

1. **Check-up on reported earnings per share**: Compare net assets at beginning and end of period, adjust for dividends paid and capital raised, reconcile with reported earnings. Discrepancies reveal charges made to surplus not deducted in income account, write-downs bypassing income statement, hidden losses or manipulated earnings.

2. **Determine effect of losses (or profits) on financial position**:
   - **Favorable pattern**: Losses represented solely by decline in inventory account; shrinkage in inventory exceeds losses, producing actual increase in cash or reduction in payables. Current-asset value maintained, cash-asset position improved.
   - **Unfavorable pattern**: Losses financed by increase in current liabilities; large reduction in cash assets; substantial loss in net current assets; working capital depleted.

3. **Trace relationship between company's resources and earning power over long period**: Analyze by decades to understand whether earning power kept pace with capital growth, whether additional capital investment produced proportionate returns, whether industry transformed from reasonably prosperous to relatively unprofitable.

### The Inventory Paradox

**From company's viewpoint**: Taking losses on inventories appears as operating loss.

**From investor's viewpoint**: If investor valued inventory in his own mind at considerably less than book figure, what appears as operating loss may have actual effect of profit—company has converted assets to cash at better realization than the conservative investor expected.

**The distinction that matters**: Decline in inventory account may result from reduction in physical quantity (actual liquidation) or decline in unit prices (marking down same physical quantity). At least half of decline during depression may be due solely to fall in unit prices. If physical quantity not much smaller, portion of shrinkage due to unit price decline resembles reduction in appraisal value of fixed assets.

**The analytical limitation**: In theory, analyst might attempt to put all companies on normal-stock basis for calculating earning power exclusive of inventory fluctuations. Actually, lacks data necessary for such calculations. Reduced to making general rather than exact allowance for distorting effect of inventory price changes.

**The 1919–1920 warning**: Profits of industrial companies in these years very large in aggregate, yet gains were in many cases result of inventory inflation—huge and speculative advance in commodity prices financed by large bank loans. The warning signs: reported earnings apparently satisfactory, but balance sheet showed inventories increased far more than needed, net current assets (excluding inventory) declined or became negative, and bank loans expanded enormously.

## Replacement Value and Modern Asset Analysis

### The Modern Extension of Graham's Approach

**Why Graham focused on liquidation value**: During the Depression, Graham went to balance sheets to determine liquidation values or current assets minus all liabilities. The logic was compelling: if company could be bought at price well below liquidation value, it was unambiguously a bargain. Earnings could pick up from industry improvement or better management; if not, company could be liquidated before value significantly damaged. Either way, shareholders who bought below liquidation value would earn satisfactory return.

**Why the approach evolved**: (1) Rapid rise in tax rates post-1940 meant strategies involving short-term gains incurred high tax costs; (2) Opportunities to buy stocks below liquidation value (abundant in 1930s) effectively disappeared in long-term prosperity that followed. Graham's beloved "net nets" are now rare.

### Replacement Value: The Competitive Constraint

**For economically viable firms**: Assets wear out or become obsolete and must be replaced. Replacement value—the lowest possible cost of reproducing a firm's net assets by competitors best positioned to do it—continues to serve the role Graham recognized.

**The competitive dynamics**: If projected profit levels for a firm imply return on assets well above cost of capital, competitors will be drawn in. That will drive down profits and with them the value of the firm. Earnings power unsupported by asset values (measured as reproduction values) will, absent special circumstances, always be at risk from erosion due to competition. Both "safety of principal" and promise of "a satisfactory return" require that thorough investors support their earnings projections with careful assessment of replacement values.

**Three possible relationships**:

1. **Asset value exceeds earnings power value**: Assets not being used to full advantage by management. Critical factor is prospect of catalyst that will alter behavior or identity of current management.

2. **Earnings power exceeds asset value**: To maintain those superior profits, there needs to be economic factors to protect firm from competition—"moats," franchises, barriers to entry, competitive advantages. Even here, asset values provide useful information about value firm will retain if factors erode in future.

3. **Earnings power and asset value approximately equal**: The circumstance that should hold with reasonable management and no special protections from competition. If qualitative judgments support such conclusions, asset value provides critical check on validity of earnings projections.

**Modern information advantages**: Today's computers can obtain and digest financial information almost instantaneously. Industry reports and trade publications, many available online, provide wealth of information on asset values inconceivable to Graham and Dodd—cost estimates for adding reserves (oil and gas), real estate transactions data, consulting engineers for plant and equipment costs. Many intangible assets now trade like real property—cable franchises, clothing brands, drug discoveries, store chains. Private market values are often used by sophisticated investors to price intangible assets.

## Case Study: WorldCom—When Balance Sheets Reveal the Truth

The financial statements of WorldCom, whose 2002 bankruptcy filing was at the time the largest ever, illustrate the usefulness of balance sheet analysis for tracking financial condition. Anyone studying the balance sheet in the years before bankruptcy would have suspected the company would come to no good end.

### Mid-1999: The Valuation Warning

**The snapshot**:
- Equity market value: $125 billion
- Year-end 1999 book value: $51.2 billion (created almost entirely by issuing shares for acquisitions—$12 billion for MFS Communications in 1996, $30 billion for MCI in 1997)
- Retained earnings over 15-year history: negligible
- Over 85% of book value: goodwill and other intangibles
- Ratio of market value to tangible net equity: in excess of 15 (ridiculously high)

**The intangibles analysis**: How valuable were those intangibles? Not worth as much as the company said. They included neither significant patents nor developed process technologies. WorldCom's business was characterized by high rates of customer churn and vigorous price competition. Nor did there appear to be large barriers to entry—WorldCom's markets were characterized by many new entrants and vigorous expansion by powerful existing competitors like AT&T. If anything, to the extent that economies of scale were relevant, WorldCom would have been operating at significant competitive disadvantage to its larger competitor.

### 1999 to 2000: The Capital Spending Red Flag

From year-end 1999 to year-end 2000:
- Net property, plant, and equipment increased 27% (~$8 billion)
- Revenues increased only 8%

**The question raised**: Why was such aggressive investment program underway? In fact, the investment figures turned out to have been fraudulently inflated by booking operating expenses as investments. However, even if they had not been fraudulent, the aggressive acceleration in PP&E growth (up from ~$5 billion in 1999) in face of decelerating revenue growth should have raised questions about management's judgment. The likelihood of a bad outcome from this insouciant attitude toward overexpansion should have been apparent.

### 2001: The Scramble for Financing

**The alarm bell developments**:
- Short-term debt almost entirely disappeared (current debt liabilities fell from $7.2 billion to $172 million)
- Long-term debt rose by about $12.5 billion (actually increased ~$14 billion since examination of footnotes indicated more than $1 billion additional long-term debt disappeared by deconsolidating the subsidiary responsible)
- In face of now-declining revenues, WorldCom felt it needed additional $7 billion in debt financing—all long-term

**What happened**: In 2000, management lost control of finances, making at best highly risky bet on future revenue growth and at worst calculated effort to disguise deteriorating operating margins by capitalizing expenses. In 2001, WorldCom scrambled for long-term financing, hoping to give management many years to solve problems. The primary vehicle was $11.9 billion debt sale to public in May 2001, underwritten by financial institutions that justified the issue in terms of future earnings and cash flow.

### The Lesson

If these institutions and their customers had followed Graham's advice to look carefully at the WorldCom balance sheet, they would have known better. They might not have fully anticipated the fraud and subsequent bankruptcy, but they would have seen enough to avoid both its stock and bonds as investments unlikely to provide either protection of principal or promise of satisfactory return.

The balance sheet told the story years in advance—but as in Graham's era, the market was too focused on the income account to notice.

## Key Principles for Modern Application

**Balance sheet analysis is not optional**: Despite decades of neglect, balance sheet remains critical to thorough security analysis. The four uses outlined at the beginning remain valid: understanding capital deployed, assessing earnings sustainability, evaluating financial condition, and verifying earnings quality.

**The liquidation value framework endures**: Even if outright liquidation opportunities are rare, the framework remains powerful. Are assets being used efficiently? Could capital be better deployed elsewhere? Is market price rational relative to realizable asset values? What would happen if this business had to be wound down?

**Balance sheets are harder to manipulate**: While not immune to abuse, balance sheets remain more standardized and verifiable than income statements. They provide critical check on reported earnings and reveal financial stress that earnings can mask temporarily.

**Management conflicts require vigilance**: The conflicts of interest Graham identified remain alive and well. Stockholders must maintain informed skepticism about management decisions involving compensation, capital allocation, dividend policy, and whether to continue operations.

**Compare balance sheets over time**: The evolution of balance sheet reveals truths that single-period snapshots and income statements may obscure. Track how efficiently capital is being converted to value over extended periods.
