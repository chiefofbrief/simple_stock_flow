# Insights: Introduction (The New Paradigm)

## CORE CONCEPT: REFLEXIVITY

Reflexivity describes a two-way interaction between participants' thinking and the situation in which they participate. On one hand, participants seek to understand reality (the **cognitive function**); on the other, they seek to bring about a desired outcome (the **participating function**). These functions work in opposite directions and interfere with each other.

"The imperfection I am concerned with arises because we are participants. When we act as outside observers we can make statements that do or do not correspond to the facts without altering the facts; when we act as participants, our actions alter the situation we seek to understand. As a consequence, we cannot base our decisions on knowledge."

**The Human Uncertainty Principle**: People's understanding of the world in which they live cannot correspond to the facts and be complete and coherent at the same time. Insofar as thinking is confined to the facts, it is not sufficient to reach decisions; insofar as it serves as the basis of decisions, it cannot be confined to the facts.

This principle differs from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle in a crucial way: theories about human behavior can and do influence human behavior. Marxism had a tremendous impact on history; market fundamentalism is having a similar influence today. A phrase like "the axis of evil" can alter the course of history.

## TWO THEORIES OF HISTORY

### The "Shoelace" Theory
The arrow of causation does not run from one set of outcomes to the next; it crisscrosses from outcomes to expectations and vice versa. Outcomes are affected but not determined by expectations. There is a two-way feedback loop: the cognitive function runs from outcomes to expectations, the participating function from expectations to outcomes. Both operate continuously and in opposite directions.

### The "Ziplock" Theory (Path Dependence)
The past is uniquely determined and closed; the future is open and contingent. Ex-post there is only one situation that has actually prevailed. Ex-ante there is a range of possibilities. This asymmetry means:
- Experiments are not repeatable (even if observable facts are identical, participants' views are liable to be different)
- Explaining ought to be easier than predicting
- The future is path-dependent: decisions made today create new realities that restrict or open tomorrow's possibilities

## WHEN REFLEXIVITY MATTERS

Reflexivity does not produce significant effects in all situations. The key distinction:

**Humdrum Events**: In everyday situations (driving to work, shopping), the divergence between thinking and reality is minimal and can be disregarded. The prevailing bias is corrected in short order. "It would be quite in order to ignore the bias as mere noise."

**Historic Events**: When the participants' misconceptions are significant enough to alter the course of events and change the participants' perceptions. "Only when the fundamentals are affected does reflexivity become significant enough to influence the course of events."

**The Test**: Does the prevailing bias have ways, via market prices, to affect the so-called fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect? If yes, a self-reinforcing process can develop. If no, the bias will self-correct quickly.

## THE PREVAILING BIAS AND MARKET PRICES

"I contend that financial markets are always wrong in the sense that they operate with a prevailing bias, but the bias can actually validate itself by influencing not only market prices but also the so-called fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect."

This replaces the efficient market assertion that "the market is always right" with two propositions:
1. Markets are always biased in one direction or another
2. Markets can influence the events that they anticipate

The combination explains why markets may so often appear to anticipate events correctly—the anticipation itself shapes the outcome.

### How Prices Affect Fundamentals
Stock prices are not merely passive reflections; they are active ingredients. A high stock price is not just a number—it is currency. It allows a company to:
- Acquire competitors using stock
- Raise cheap capital
- Attract talent through stock compensation
- Improve credit ratings
- Enhance management credibility and consumer acceptance

"The influence of these factors on stock prices is, of course, fully recognized; it is the influence of stock prices on these factors that is so strangely ignored by the fundamentalist approach."

### Credit and Collateral: A Fundamental Reflexive Relationship
"Banks base their lending on the value of the collateral; but the act of lending can also influence that value. When people are eager to borrow and the banks are willing to lend, the value of the collateral rises in a self-reinforcing manner and vice versa."

This reflexive connection between lending and collateral value gives boom/bust sequences their characteristic **asymmetric shape: slowly rising and abruptly falling**. The liquidation of credit accelerates the decline.

## THE FLAW: Key to Understanding Reflexive Processes

"The major insight I gained from the theory of reflexivity and what I now call the human uncertainty principle is that all human constructs (concepts, business plans or institutional arrangements) are flawed. The flaws may be revealed only after the construct has come into existence. That is the key to understanding reflexive processes. Recognizing the flaws that are likely to appear when a hypothesis becomes reality puts you ahead of the game."

**Fertile Fallacies**: Misconceptions that are significant enough to influence the course of events—and in doing so, temporarily validate themselves. The analyst's task is not to debunk fallacies immediately, but to determine whether they are currently capable of driving a self-reinforcing loop.

"The fact that a thesis is flawed does not mean that we should not invest in it as long as other people believe in it and there is a large group of people left to be convinced... Where I have something significant to add is in pointing out that it pays to look for the flaws; if we find them, we are ahead of the game because we can limit our losses when the market also discovers what we already know. It is when we are unaware of what could go wrong that we have to worry."

### The Fundamentalist Fallacy
"Just because a construct has proved flawed, its opposite is bound to be flawless." This error, combined with the efficient market hypothesis, gave rise to market fundamentalism. The same fallacy appears in communism and among antiglobalization activists. Whatever regime prevails is bound to be flawed—but that does not render its opposite flawless.

## BOOM/BUST SEQUENCES

Flaws and misconceptions play a crucial role in individual boom/bust sequences. Usually they involve a failure to recognize that a relationship is reflexive:

**The Conglomerate Boom (1960s)**
- **The Flaw**: Investors valued earnings growth irrespective of how it was achieved
- **The Mechanism**: High P/E companies acquired low P/E companies using stock, mathematically increasing EPS, which the market rewarded with higher multiples
- **The Turning Point**: Saul Steinberg's failed attempt to acquire Chemical Bank—the establishment united against him

**The Technology Boom (1990s)**
- **The Flaw**: Stocks were valued at multiples of revenues (not earnings), and growth was financed by selling stock rather than following sound business plans
- **The Mechanism**: Inflated stock prices allowed companies to raise capital for infrastructure; this spending became revenue for other tech companies, creating a closed loop
- **The Turning Point**: The 3G spectrum auctions forced telecom companies to spend actual cash instead of stock. Until then, inflated stock prices had been a source of cash; on that occasion they turned into a cash drain

**The Sovereign Lending Boom (1970s)**
- **The Flaw**: Banks failed to recognize that their willingness to lend enhanced the various debt ratios by which they measured borrowers' creditworthiness
- **The Mechanism**: Easy credit improved country metrics, which justified more credit

In each case, misconceptions were reinforced by positive changes in fundamentals until expectations became unsustainable.

## SOROS'S METHODOLOGY

### Organic Thinking
"As a money manager I was emotionally engaged in managing my fund. I managed it as if my existence depended on it, as indeed it did. I relied on my instincts and intuition as well as my conceptual framework to guide me through uncertainty."

Soros distinguishes between "organic" thinking (using the whole self—reason and emotion—as an instrument) and the detached rationality assumed by economic theory. Scientists seek timeless generalizations and statistical probabilities; participants must focus on the one particular case in which they are participating.

### Empathy Over Detachment
"The participant enters into the mind of the market and tries to understand it from the inside. I found the task easier than most other investors, partly because of my conceptual framework and partly because I identified myself with my hedge fund so intimately. I assumed that the market felt the same way as I did, and by keeping myself detached from other personal feelings I could sense changes in its mood."

**Somatic Markers**: Soros used physical cues (acute backache) as early warning signals of a flaw in the portfolio, often before he could intellectually articulate the problem. "It used to occur before I knew what was wrong, often even before the fund began to decline in value. That is what made it so valuable as a signal."

### Invest First, Investigate Later
"If an idea was appealing enough to attract me on first hearing, it was likely to have the same effect on others. On further investigation, if I found it to be flawed I could always turn around and liquidate my position with a profit provided I was not the last one to hear it. If the idea checked out, I was better situated to increase my position because I had already bought at a lower price or sold short at a higher one."

### Going for the Jugular
"I used to claim, only half jokingly, that it took me 48 hours to become an expert on any subject; if I spent any more time on it my judgment would be clouded by the facts. Specialists often develop a vested interest in their subject; the information they collect is never enough for them. I was only interested in the information that was sufficient to make a decision; the rest would merely confuse the issues."

### The Arbitrage of Flaws
"I operated on the assumption that all investment theses are flawed." Standard analysts look for truth (undervalued assets). Soros looked for flaws—and for the divergence between his own judgment and the prevailing view. "I made a conscious effort to find investment theses that were at odds with the prevailing opinion because that is where the best profit opportunities are to be found."

## RISK MANAGEMENT

The use of leverage makes a hedge fund "three-dimensional"—it can collapse entirely, not just shrink. This made uncertainty existential.

**Risk Only Gains, Not Capital**: "I was willing to risk only my gains, not my capital. This gave the fund its own momentum: picking up speed when the wind was behind us and trimming sails in stormy weather."

**Survival First**: "He who runs away lives to fight another day." Soros refused to be bound by the calendar in deciding what counts as profit vs. principal. After a good run, he was willing to give back a portion of gains even if it pushed into negative territory in a new year.

**Two-Day Test**: "Two days—one up day and one down day—were sufficient to tell me whether my fund was well positioned. Usually this gave me timely notice to make some adjustments."

## THE ROLE OF REGULATORS

"In the absence of equilibrium, it is the task of the authorities to prevent or correct market excesses. But they, too, are fallible. Although they are supposed to be above the fray, they are also participants with their own institutional interests and biases. The result is a reflexive interaction between regulators and markets, a kind of cat and mouse game, which occasionally deteriorates into a boom/bust sequence due to the regulators' failure to prevent it from happening."

Financial crises usually lead to tightening of regulations—but these regulations often fight the last war (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley after Enron, Glass-Steagall after 1929).

## A KEY DISTINCTION

"There is a difference between what is successful and what is true. That is one of the great insights that the theory of reflexivity has to offer and it applies both to the financial markets and politics."
