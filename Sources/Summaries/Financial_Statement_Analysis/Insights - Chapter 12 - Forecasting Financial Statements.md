# Chapter 12: Forecasting Financial Statements

## Why Projections Matter for Equity Investors

**Historical statements provide no competitive advantage**—they're available to everyone. Stock prices reflect discounted future earnings and dividends, not past results. To find businesses trading below intrinsic value, you must form a view on future earning power that differs from consensus and proves correct.

**Core principle**: Financial projections are "an extension of historical patterns and relationships, based on assumptions about future economic conditions, market behavior, and managerial actions." Your edge comes from better assumptions, not better arithmetic. "Analysts must energetically gather information beyond the statements themselves"—talk to customers, suppliers, competitors, industry experts.

**The investment question**: Can this business sustain or grow its competitive advantages? Projections force you to articulate specific assumptions about market share, pricing power, cost structure resilience, and capital requirements. When your projections diverge materially from reality, you learn which aspects of the business model you misunderstood.

## The Sequential Framework: Understanding Statement Interconnections

Projecting the three statements in sequence reveals how business decisions flow through financials:

**1. Income Statement** (start here) → Net income and depreciation reveal earning power and capital intensity

**2. Cash Flow Statement** (uses income statement) → Shows whether earnings translate to cash and capital requirements

**3. Balance Sheet** (completes the picture) → Reveals whether growth requires external financing

This sequence exposes the "interrelatedness of the income statement, the cash flow statement, and the balance sheet." A company claiming strong earnings growth while consuming massive working capital tells a different story than one converting earnings to free cash flow. Breaking this sequence means missing these connections.

## Revenue Projection: Assessing Growth Sustainability and Market Position

### The Bottom-Up Approach Reveals Business Drivers

**For established industries**: Build segment-by-segment forecasts using industry data to establish whether revenue growth reflects genuine market expansion or share gains versus competitors. A chemical company segment growing at 1.5× industrial production indicates market share capture; growth merely matching industry growth suggests maintaining position.

**The competitive advantage test**: Can the company take price increases in line with inflation, or does competition force price concessions? Companies with pricing power maintain revenue per unit through cycles; those in commoditized businesses see revenue per unit compress during downturns even if unit volumes hold.

**For technology/consumer sectors**: Industry-wide forecasts matter less than company-specific product cycle assessment. "Forecasting in such circumstances depends largely on developing contacts within the industry being studied" to gauge whether new products will succeed or existing products face obsolescence.

**Geographic breakdown utility**: Reveals concentration risk and growth source diversification. A company with 40% of revenue from a slowing region faces different prospects than one diversified across growing markets.

### What Revenue Projections Reveal About the Business

**Market share trajectory**: Company revenue growth substantially above industry growth with maintained margins indicates strengthening competitive position. Revenue growth above industry with compressing margins suggests buying share through price cuts—a warning sign.

**Pricing power durability**: Project both volume and price components separately. Companies that maintain price increases through economic weakness demonstrate moat strength. Those forced to cut prices to maintain volume reveal commodity-like competition.

**Customer concentration**: Revenue projection difficulty (requires individual customer relationship forecasting rather than macro trends) signals dangerous customer concentration. Businesses with thousands of small customers project more reliably than those dependent on handful of large buyers.

## Margin Drivers: Understanding Business Economics

### Gross Margin: The Business Model Fingerprint

Cost of goods sold as percentage of sales "reflects expectations about changes in costs of labor and material" plus "expected intensity of industry competition, which affects a company's ability to pass cost increases on to customers or to retain cost decreases."

**Calculation method**: Project COGS as percentage of sales based on historical ratio:
```
Projected COGS = Projected Sales × Historical COGS %
```

If historical COGS has been 69% of sales (31% gross margin), maintain this assumption unless specific factors indicate change.

**Capacity utilization matters for capital-intensive businesses**: At full capacity, fixed costs spread over maximum volume minimizing unit costs. When demand exceeds capacity and all producers run flat out, none has incentive to cut prices—cost increases pass through fully and gross margins expand. "Conversely, if demand were expected to fall...leading to a decline in capacity utilization...projected gross margin would probably be lower."

**What this reveals about competitive position**: Companies maintaining margins during industry capacity gluts have genuine competitive advantages—superior products, service, or switching costs. Those seeing margins compress during slack capacity periods are price takers in commodity markets.

**The capital intensity trade-off**: High-fixed-cost businesses show dramatic margin leverage to revenue changes (good in growth, painful in decline). Variable-cost businesses sacrifice margin upside for downside protection. Understanding this shapes portfolio position sizing.

### SG&A and R&D: The Controllability Question

**SG&A typically stable at percentage of sales**: Historical ratio around 15% continues unless management commentary indicates changing strategy.

**Calculation method**:
```
Projected SG&A = Projected Sales × Historical SG&A %
```

**Investment implications**: Companies that can't leverage SG&A as they grow (percentage rises with revenue) may lack scalability—growth doesn't improve unit economics.

**R&D as percentage of sales reveals innovation imperative**: "Along with advertising, R&D is an expense that is typically budgeted on a percentage-of-sales basis."

**Calculation method**:
```
Projected R&D = Projected Sales × Historical R&D %
```

Stable R&D percentage in technology businesses indicates maintaining competitive position. Declining R&D percentage may signal: (1) maturing business with less innovation need, or (2) dangerous underinvestment to boost short-term earnings.

**Business model difference**: Consumer products companies show steady advertising as percentage of sales—brand maintenance requirement. B2B industrial companies show minimal advertising but higher R&D—products sell on specifications not brand awareness.

### Depreciation: The Capital Intensity Signal

Depreciation as percentage of PP&E reveals asset intensity and reinvestment requirements. "If company writes off all asset classes over 10 years on straight-line basis, depreciation equals 10% of PP&E annually."

**Calculation method**: Apply historical depreciation rate to prior year-end PP&E:
```
Projected Depreciation = Prior Year-End PP&E × Historical Depreciation %
```

Example from chapter: "Exhibit 12.2 forecasts depreciation expenses equivalent to 8.0 percent of PP&E as of the preceding year-end, based on a stable ratio between the two items over an extended period."

**Investment implications**:
- High depreciation relative to PP&E (8-10%) signals asset-heavy business requiring continuous reinvestment to maintain position
- Low depreciation (2-3%) indicates asset-light model where profits convert to free cash flow
- Compare depreciation to capex over time: capex consistently exceeding depreciation by wide margin indicates growth requiring constant external funding; capex approximating depreciation signals mature business self-funding maintenance

**Warning sign**: Company suddenly lengthening asset lives (reducing depreciation percentage) to boost earnings may be gaming numbers. Verify against industry peers and inquire about actual asset obsolescence.

### Interest Expense: Understanding Financing Costs

For companies with significant debt, interest expense affects earnings materially. Project using embedded cost method.

**Simplified calculation approach**:

1. Calculate average debt outstanding for each issue:
```
Average Outstanding = (Prior Year-End Balance + Current Year-End Balance) ÷ 2
```

2. Apply each issue's stated interest rate to calculate interest charges

3. Sum all interest charges and divide by total average debt:
```
Embedded Cost % = Total Interest Charges ÷ Total Average Debt Outstanding
```

4. Apply this rate to projected average debt outstanding:
```
Projected Long-Term Interest = Projected Average Debt × Embedded Cost %
```

5. Add short-term debt interest separately:
```
Short-Term Interest = Projected Average Short-Term Debt × Assumed Short-Term Rate
```

**Investment implication**: This calculation shows how interest expense grows with leverage. Companies with high embedded costs refinancing into lower-rate environment see earnings boost without operational improvement. Conversely, those facing refinancing at higher rates will see earnings pressured even with stable operations.

**When precision matters**: For modestly leveraged companies where interest is 1-2% of sales, 10% estimation error has minimal earnings impact. Focus precision on highly leveraged companies where "financial viability may depend on the size of the interest expense nut they must cover each quarter."

## Capital Requirements: Cash Generation vs. Consumption

### Working Capital: The Hidden Cash Drain

**Calculation method**: Project each item at same percentage of sales as historically:
```
Projected Accounts Receivable = Projected Sales × (Historical A/R ÷ Historical Sales)
Projected Inventory = Projected Sales × (Historical Inventory ÷ Historical Sales)
Projected Accounts Payable = Projected Sales × (Historical A/P ÷ Historical Sales)
```

Example from chapter: "Accounts receivable, for example, at approximately 11 percent of sales, rise from $1,017 million to $1,058 million, an increase of $41 million, as sales grow from $9,247 million in 2020 to a projected $9,617 million in 2021."

**Critical verification**: "Verify that the most recent year's ratios are representative of experience over several years."

**The growth penalty**: Fast-growing companies consume cash building working capital even with strong margins. Receivables, inventory rise with sales while payables may not keep pace. **Investment implication**: High-growth companies with negative free cash flow aren't necessarily bad businesses—they're consuming capital to fund growth. The question is whether returns on that deployed capital will exceed cost of capital.

**Warning signals**:
- Inventories rising faster than sales suggests slowing demand or poor planning—product may be less appealing than forecast
- Receivables rising faster than sales indicates customers paying more slowly (credit quality deterioration) or company loosening credit terms to maintain volume

### Capital Expenditure: Growth vs. Maintenance Requirements

Most companies provide capex guidance in annual reports, quarterly updates, or through investor relations. Use these as starting points, but understand strategic implications.

**The reinvestment requirement test**: Compare capex to depreciation over 3-5 years:
- Capex ≈ depreciation suggests mature business maintaining position, generating cash for shareholders
- Capex >> depreciation indicates growth requiring constant reinvestment—verify the returns justify the capital consumption
- Capex < depreciation may signal: (1) asset-light business transitioning to more capital-light model (good), or (2) underinvestment that will impair future competitiveness (bad)

**Industry context matters**: Software businesses can grow rapidly with minimal capex increases. Manufacturers require proportional capex to sales growth. Retailers need new locations (capex) to grow but face risk of overexpansion into marginal markets.

### Free Cash Flow: The Ultimate Business Quality Measure

Operating cash flow minus capex reveals whether business generates or consumes cash. **Investment implication**: Businesses consistently generating substantial free cash flow (>5% of sales) can return capital to shareholders, make acquisitions without issuing equity, or maintain fortress balance sheets. Those consuming cash require repeated trips to capital markets, diluting shareholders.

**Life cycle considerations**:
- Young, high-growth companies may show negative free cash flow while building moat—acceptable if returns materialize
- Mature companies with negative free cash flow signal serious problems—lack pricing power, facing obsolescence, or poor capital allocation
- Management repeatedly promising future free cash flow that never materializes reveals flawed business model

## Balance Sheet Projection: Completing the Picture

The balance sheet projection uses outputs from the income statement and cash flow statement with minimal additional assumptions.

### Property, Plant & Equipment Rollforward

**Calculation**:
```
Ending PP&E = Beginning PP&E + Capital Expenditures - Depreciation
```

This reveals the net capital invested in the business during the period. PP&E growing rapidly signals capital intensity; stable or declining PP&E indicates mature asset base.

### Shareholders' Equity Rollforward

**Calculation**:
```
Ending Shareholders' Equity = Beginning Equity + Net Income - Dividends
```

Add back any stock issuances, subtract share repurchases if modeling these explicitly.

### The Debt Allocation Puzzle

"Work out as a small puzzle" rather than tracking every paydown and issuance:

**Steps**:

1. Calculate total liabilities and equity needs:
```
Total L&E Required = Total Assets
```

2. Subtract non-debt items already determined:
```
Remaining for Debt = Total L&E - (Accounts Payable + Deferred Taxes + Shareholders' Equity)
```

3. Fill in current portion of long-term debt (amount due within 12 months per debt footnotes)

4. Allocate remainder between short-term and long-term debt in same proportions as prior year:
```
Notes Payable = Remainder × (Prior Notes Payable ÷ Prior Total Debt)
Long-Term Debt = Remainder × (Prior LT Debt ÷ Prior Total Debt)
```

5. Calculate cash flow statement amounts by subtracting prior year from projected amounts

**Investment implication**: This reveals whether business generates enough cash to reduce debt or requires increasing leverage to fund operations. Companies needing steady debt increases to fund operations may have flawed economics.

## Sensitivity Analysis: Identifying Key Value Drivers

"Wise investors and lenders will not base their decisions entirely on a single set of projections, or point forecast. Instead, they will assess the risks and potential rewards in light of a range of outcomes."

### The Three-Scenario Framework

**Standard approach**:
- **Optimistic case**: Best realistic scenario
- **Base case**: Most likely scenario
- **Pessimistic case**: Worst realistic scenario

"Assumptions need not be symmetrical"—analyst "simply believes that the most range of possible outcomes involves more downside than upside." This asymmetry itself reveals business risk—businesses with substantial downside risk relative to upside may not justify investment regardless of base case valuation.

### Which Assumptions Matter Most?

Test impact of changing individual assumptions while holding others constant. Example from chapter: 1% gross margin change impacts net income by $76M, while 1% tax rate change affects net income by just $4M—**investment implication**: Understand margin drivers deeply; tax rate forecasting precision matters less.

**Method**: Change one assumption at a time, recalculate income statement:
- Test 1% increase/decrease in gross margin
- Test 1% increase/decrease in SG&A as % of sales
- Test 5-10% change in sales growth
- Test 100 basis point change in interest rates (for leveraged companies)

Compare magnitude of earnings impact to identify which assumptions drive most value.

**Critical warning**: "Sensitivity analysis must be used with caution. It generally isolates a single assumption and proceeds on the assumption that all other things remain equal. In the real world, this is rarely the case."

**Real-world interactions matter**:
- Falling sales typically means compressing margins too (fixed cost deleverage plus pricing pressure)
- Rising interest rates depress investment economy-wide, eventually reducing company sales
- Commodity price spikes often coincide with demand weakness, creating double impact

**Investment application**: Focus sensitivity analysis on variables management can't control (commodity prices, interest rates, economic growth) to understand downside risk. Companies whose value depends heavily on factors outside management control are riskier than those with controllable destiny.

## When Projections Go Wrong: Learning About the Business

### The Energy Forecast Debacle: Business Cycle Misreading

Late 1970s prognosticators expected persistent energy tightness and oil price escalation. "By the early 1980s, the energy picture had changed from scarcity to glut, and many companies that had expected prosperity instead suffered bankruptcy."

**Investment lesson**: Base case forecasts extrapolating current trends will be wrong. Businesses positioned for single scenario (scarcity or abundance) carry binary outcome risk. Those with flexibility to prosper across scenarios (low cost structure, adaptable business model) outperform over long horizons.

### Subsequent Discontinuities Force Plan Revisions

"The frequency of such shocks makes it difficult to have high confidence in projections covering periods even as short as five years"—yet multiyear views remain essential for understanding business trajectory.

**The list of discontinuities** (sovereign debt defaults, stock crashes, LBO bankruptcies, wars, tech boom/bust, financial crisis, COVID-19 pandemic) illustrates that major surprises occur frequently. **Investment implication**: Position size should reflect this irreducible uncertainty. Companies that can survive and adapt to unforeseen shocks (fortress balance sheets, flexible cost structures, diverse revenue sources) merit larger positions than those requiring specific scenario to avoid distress.

### The Proper Forecasting Mindset

"Analysts should not be disheartened if their predictions miss the mark, even widely on occasion. They should aim not for absolute prescience but rather for a sound probabilistic model of the future."

**Track your assumptions, not just conclusions**: When projections prove wrong, diagnose which assumptions failed:
- Misread industry growth? Reveals need for better industry research.
- Missed competitive threat? Signals moat weaker than believed.
- Failed to anticipate margin pressure? Misunderstood business economics.

"By tracking the after-the-fact accuracy of a number of projections, an analyst can gauge the effectiveness of these methods." The goal isn't perfect forecasts—it's continuous improvement in understanding business drivers.

## Management Quality Signals in Projections

### Capital Allocation: The Ultimate Management Test

Projected uses of cash reveal management's capital allocation discipline:

**Dividend policy consistency**: Companies maintaining stated payout policies (e.g., one-third of earnings) through cycles signal discipline. Those cutting dividends during mild downturns or borrowing to maintain unsustainable payouts reveal poor judgment.

**Debt management**: "Net cash generated → applied to debt retirement" assumes reasonable capital allocation. But "conservatively capitalized companies generally do not seek to reduce their financial leverage below some specified level. Instead, they use surplus funds to repurchase stock or make acquisitions."

**Investment implications**:
- Excessive leverage reduction (beyond optimal capital structure) suggests management fears accessing capital markets—red flag
- Share repurchases at high valuations reveal poor capital allocation
- Serial acquisitions with projected "synergies" deserve skepticism—most synergies disappoint

### The Guidance Track Record

Compare management's historical guidance to actual results over multiple years:

**Reliable guiders**: Historical guidance proves accurate within reasonable ranges → management understands business drivers deeply, communicates honestly

**Consistent missers**: Actual results persistently fall short of guidance → either management doesn't understand business or deliberately misleads

**Sandbaggers**: Actual results consistently exceed lowball guidance → management gaming expectations rather than providing useful information

Track this yourself—many companies won't disclose historical guidance accuracy.

## Pro Forma Adjustments: Integration Uncertainty Over Accounting Mechanics

When companies announce major acquisitions, pro forma statements show expected combined entity. Focus on strategic logic, not accounting details.

### CVS Health-Aetna: What Matters for Investment Decision

The $77B deal raised fundamental questions:

**Strategic rationale**: Defensive move against competitors and Amazon threat. Did combination create sustainable competitive advantage or merely add complexity?

**Revenue synergies vs. integration challenges**: Deal promised $6.7B of internal revenue synergies, but "pro forma statements may meticulously detail the accounting ramifications of a business combination, but they cannot fully capture the uncertainties inherent in trying to make two previously independent companies mesh."

**The proof point**: "Questions lingered in February 2020 when the former Aetna Chief Executive Officer resigned from CVS Health's board and said the integration was 'far from over.' CVS's CEO, in contrast, called the integration 'successful.'"

**Investment lesson**: Acquisition pro formas show accounting, not integration success. Focus on: (1) Strategic logic—does combination create competitive advantages? (2) Management track record—have they integrated acquisitions successfully before? (3) Price paid—does it allow room for error?

## Covenant Compliance: When Projections Become Survival

"Sanctions against technical default (covenant violation) can be severe"—barred from paying dividends, forced loan repayment, dilutive equity sales, or loss of management autonomy through lender oversight.

**Investment implication**: Companies projecting near covenant violations face forced value-destructive actions regardless of business quality. This creates asymmetric risk—covenants force selling assets or cutting growth investment precisely when most damaging to long-term value.

**The warning sign**: Review covenant terms in credit agreements (found in 10-K footnotes). Companies projecting coverage ratios within 10-15% of covenant triggers carry meaningful risk of forced actions that destroy shareholder value. Either avoid or size position for binary outcome risk.

## The Multiyear Challenge: When Long-Term Views Are Required

### Capital-Intensive Businesses with Long Construction Cycles

Paper manufacturers, refineries, chip fabs require huge plants taking years to build. "While a plant is in construction, the company must pay interest on huge sums borrowed to finance it. This increased expense depresses earnings until the point, several years out, when the new plant comes onstream."

**Investment implication**: Near-term earnings tell you nothing. Must project through full cycle—construction phase (depressed earnings from interest, no revenue) through ramp-up to steady state. Companies with poor cycle timing (bringing capacity online into glut) can show years of value destruction despite quality assets.

### Business Cycle Sensitivity

"When looking forward by as much as five years, the analyst must be especially cognizant of the impact of the business cycle. Many companies' projected financial statements look fine as long as sales grow like a hockey stick (sloping upward). Their financial strength dissipates quickly, however, when sales turn downward for a year or two."

**The stress test**: Model a cyclical downturn scenario. Companies that maintain positive free cash flow through trough demonstrate quality—either low fixed costs, strong pricing power, or both. Those projecting distress in modest downturn reveal fragility.

---

**Final principle**: "When betting huge sums in the face of massive uncertainty, it is essential that investors understand the odds as fully as they possibly can." Projections don't eliminate uncertainty—they clarify which uncertainties matter most and how much margin of safety exists at current valuation.
