# Chapter 13: Credit Analysis

## OBJECTIVE

Credit analysis extends beyond financial statements to assess both **ability** and **willingness** to repay. While balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow ratios provide essential tools for measuring credit risk, **the analyst must recognize that financial statements alone cannot determine credit quality.** Management's attitude toward debt, off-balance-sheet obligations, and the sustainability of reported performance often matter as much as the ratios themselves. The most powerful insights come from combination ratios that integrate multiple financial statements.

## The Foundational Limitation: Statements Don't Tell the Whole Story

Financial statements tell much about a borrower's **ability** to repay but disclose little about equally important **willingness** to repay. A thorough credit analysis must therefore consider:

- **Payment history**: Past record of repayment (not part of standard financial statements)
- **Competitive environment**: Strength of local economy and industry dynamics
- **Credit support**: Formal or informal backing by stronger entities (parent guarantees, implicit support for critical subsidiaries)
- **Public policy**: Central banks acting as lenders of last resort (particularly for banks)

**The municipal bond principle**: Many municipalities obtain cost savings by having bond insurers guarantee debt payments. For bondholders, **the insurer's creditworthiness, not the municipality's financial condition, is the basis for determining likelihood of repayment.** Similar logic applies to corporate subsidiaries critical to parent operations—even without legal obligation, parent may stand behind subsidiary debt.

## Balance Sheet Analysis: Liquidity, Leverage, and the Gaming Strategies

**Why equity investors care about credit metrics**: Companies with poor credit quality face higher borrowing costs, reduced financial flexibility, and limited ability to invest through downturns. High leverage amplifies both gains and losses, creating asymmetric risk profiles. **Most critically, deteriorating credit often precedes equity value destruction**—by the time leverage becomes obvious problem, equity may be severely impaired or worthless.

### Liquidity Measures: The Near-Term Warning System

**Current ratio** = Current assets ÷ Current liabilities

**Quick ratio (acid test)** = (Cash + Marketable securities + Receivables) ÷ Current liabilities

**Working capital** = Current assets − Current liabilities

These gauge risk of illiquidity (inability to raise cash to pay obligations). But **impending illiquidity warnings don't prevent lenders from periodically finding themselves with defaulted loans**—hence the need for asset protection measures that look beyond near-term.

### Leverage Ratios: What Actually Constitutes Debt?

**The short-term debt trap**: At one time, appropriate to consider only long-term debt (short-term was seasonal). Many borrowers have since subverted this by relying heavily on short-term debt that's neither repaid interim nor funded when it grows sufficient for bond offering. **Such short-term debt must be viewed as permanent and included in leverage calculations.**

**Two risks of short-term reliance**:
1. **Illiquidity risk**: Substantial debt due when lenders unable/unwilling to renew (mitigated by revolving credit agreements)
2. **Interest rate risk**: Sharp rate increases skyrocket borrowing costs overnight (applies to floating-rate long-term debt too)

**The convertible debt debate**: Borrowers argue it should be excluded. Hard-liners respond: **"It's equity when holders convert it to equity. Until then, it's debt."** Realistically, if conversion value rises sufficiently (especially with issuer call option), most holders will convert. Best practice: count as debt but consider conversion possibility when comparing to peers.

**Preferred stock puzzle**: Legally equity (ranks junior to debt in liquidation), pays dividend not interest, omission doesn't constitute default. But dividends contractually fixed, issuer reluctant to omit (sends financial strain signal), many cumulative (must repay arrearages before resuming common dividends). **Treating purely as equity understates financial risk.**

**Total fixed obligations ratio** = (Total debt + Preferred + Preference) ÷ (Total debt + Minority interest + Preferred + Preference + Common equity)

### Off-Balance-Sheet Liabilities: The Shell Game

**Joint ventures and partially owned subsidiaries**: Minimum—attribute proportionate liability. But if affiliate's operations critical to parent (jointly owned pulp plant supplying wholly-owned paper plant), parent has strong incentive to pick up debt service if partner becomes incapacitated, **even with no legal obligation (several vs. joint obligation).** May be appropriate to attribute up to 100% of affiliate debt.

**Employee benefit obligations**: Unlike other hidden liabilities, arise exclusively for business purposes (attracting/retaining employees) rather than surreptitious leverage. Fully funded pension obligations present few credit worries for going concern. **Large or growing underfunded liability becomes significantly negative consideration in assessing deteriorating credit.**

**Deferred taxes as capital**: Many analysts add to denominator in debt-to-capital calculation (as long as company continues paying taxes below statutory rate, account will grow—not really a liability). **Practice generally sound, but not all deferrals are permanent** (e.g., defense contractor on contract about to complete).

## Management's Attitude: The Bait-and-Switch Technique

**The pattern**: Management announces it's learned conservative financial policies serve shareholders best. Never again will company undergo financial strain from excessive borrowing. Institutes new policies improving cash flow, pays down short-term borrowings. Credit analysts impressed by favorable ratio trends, company floats long-term bonds at attractive rate. **Once cash is in coffers, management reverts to aggressive financial policies that recently got company into trouble.**

**Why rating agencies resist**: Moody's and S&P place heavy emphasis on management's attitude when assigning ratings. Strive to avoid upgrading companies in response to balance sheet improvements unlikely to last beyond next public offering. Companies complain agencies "backward-looking" and "dwelling on past weaker ratios." **In reality, agencies are thinking ahead**—inferring recent leverage reduction reflects expediency, not long-term shift in debt policy.

**The escape clause**: Listen closely during debt offerings when prospective buyer asks if management will stay on course come hell or high water. CEO casually replies: **"Of course, if once-in-a-lifetime major acquisition opportunity were to come along requiring us to borrow, we would delay debt reduction temporarily."** Analyst can generally assume that shortly after bond deal closes, the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will materialize.

**General assumption**: Achieving higher bond ratings is secondary goal of corporate management. If stock has been languishing, management won't feel urgency about eliminating debt (reduces ROE). Typical CEO finds it difficult to resist chance to run substantially bigger company, **even if it means borrowing huge amounts and precipitating rating downgrade rather than hoped-for upgrade.**

## Income Statement Ratios: Profits Sustain Liquidity

The contemporary view: **profits ultimately sustain liquidity and asset values.** High profits keep cash flowing and confirm value of productive assets. Income statement no longer of interest mainly to equity analyst but essential to credit analysis.

### Profit Margins

**Gross margin** = (Sales − COGS) ÷ Sales
*Measures buying/selling skill, particularly important for retailers*

**Operating margin** = (NI + Taxes + Interest − Other income) ÷ Sales
*Shows how well management ran business before financial policies and tax rates*

**Pretax margin** = (NI + Taxes) ÷ Sales
*Adds financial policy impact*

**Net margin** = NI ÷ Sales
*Reflects all factors whether under management control or not*

**The narrowness risk**: Narrower the margin, greater the danger that modest decline in prices or increase in costs produces losses, which erode balance sheet measures like debt-to-capital by reducing equity.

**Critical vigilance**: Confirm management continuing to reinvest in business to preserve long-run profitability. Risk is management cuts investment spending, elevating near-term profits to boost stock price.

### Fixed-Charge Coverage

**EBIT coverage** = (NI + Taxes + Interest) ÷ Interest

**EBITDA coverage** = (NI + Taxes + Interest + D&A) ÷ Interest

**The temporal distinction**: EBITDA coverage provides insight into short-to-intermediate-term ability to stay current on interest. But **over longer run, companies do need cash to replace assets giving rise to D&A. EBIT coverage is therefore truer measure of long-term ability to meet obligations.**

**Critical adjustments**:

1. **Capitalized interest**: All interest incurred must be covered, whether expensed or capitalized. Add capitalized interest to denominator only (already reflected in NI, so adding to numerator = double counting).

   **Adjusted formula** = (NI + Taxes + Interest) ÷ (Interest expense + Capitalized interest)

2. **Operating leases**: Virtually same economic impact as on-balance-sheet debt. One approach: add total rental expense to both numerator and denominator. Alternative: add 1/3 of rentals (theory: 1/3 represents interest, 2/3 principal repayment).

   **Adjusted formula** = (NI + Taxes + Interest + ⅓ Rentals) ÷ (Interest + Capitalized interest + ⅓ Rentals)

3. **Interest income**: Companies argue denominator should include only net interest expense (gross interest − interest income from marketable securities). **Can be deceptive when company holds large but temporary portfolio of securities.** Coverage based on net interest in current year can greatly overstate protection expected next year after funds invested in operating assets. Exception: if strategy is to invest substantial portion indefinitely in securities (some pharmaceutical manufacturers for tax benefits), consider associated liquidity as positive factor.

## Cash Flow Ratios: The Most Elemental Level

Ratios related to sources and uses measure credit quality at most elemental level—**ability to generate sufficient cash to pay bills.** Also disclose financial flexibility: company not reliant on external financing can take greater operating risks than one forced to retrench if new capital becomes scarce/expensive.

### Cash Flow to Capital Expenditures

**Formula** = Cash flow from operations ÷ Capital expenditures

Higher ratio = greater financial flexibility. But **examine reasons underlying changes:**

- **Normal cycle**: Capital-intensive industries go through spending cycles (large-scale plants requiring several years to complete, then ease for few years). Down leg doesn't imply long-term deterioration.
- **Prolonged downtrend**: Company likely getting more deeply into debt, becoming financially riskier each year.
- **Rising ratio from cuts**: May appear to increase flexibility, but cutting back may impair long-run competitiveness by sacrificing market share or falling behind technologically.

**Sustainability metric**: **Depreciation ÷ Cash flow from operations**

Unlike earnings, depreciation is programmed item, cash flow assured by accounting rules. **Higher the percentage from depreciation, more predictable cash flow and less dependent on market vagaries.**

### Capital Expenditures to Depreciation

**Formula** = Capex ÷ Depreciation

Ratio <1.0 over several years raises red flag—suggests failing to replace plant/equipment. **Underspending on capital replacement amounts to gradual liquidation of firm.**

**But can't assume all is well simply because capex consistently exceeds depreciation**:
- Persistent inflation means nominal dollar today won't buy as much capacity as when depreciating asset acquired (technological advances may mitigate)
- Depreciation may be understated re: wear-and-tear or obsolescence
- Capex may be too low even if matching depreciation in every sense—growth industry company failing to expand at competitor rates may lose economies of scale, fall victim to shakeout

### Free Cash Flow

**Formula** = Cash flow from operating activities − Capex − Dividends

Some analysts focusing on highly leveraged companies put primary emphasis on ability to generate positive FCF. Reason: **as long as company has sufficient cash flow to replace fixed assets and satisfy shareholders' payout demands, won't be dependent on outside financing.** Management will have option of retiring debt, reducing financial risk. Key question: is profitability underlying the operating cash flow sustainable?

## Combination Ratios: The Wheelbarrow Principle

Like prehistoric inventors combining lever and wheel to create wheelbarrow, **combining numbers from different financial statements unleashes vast new analytical power.**

### Return Measures and the Leverage Trap

**Return on equity** = NI ÷ (Common equity + Preferred equity)

**The leverage distortion**: Company can raise ROE by increasing debt proportion in capital structure—change that reduces credit quality.

**Concrete example** (from chapter):

| Metric | Company X (Conservative) | Company Y (Leveraged) |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Debt/equity | 31% | 90% |
| Operating margin | 13.2% | 13.2% |
| Net margin | 10.0% | 9.2% |
| **Return on equity** | **15.3%** | **20.7%** |
| Fixed-charge coverage | 22.0× | 8.3× |

Company Y produces higher ROE despite equivalent operations and lower net margin. Its edge comes purely from leverage—which makes it *riskier*, not better.

**The check**: Calculate return on total capital, which equalizes for capital structure differences:

**Return on total capital** = (NI + Taxes + Interest) ÷ (Total debt + Total equity)

For Companies X and Y: 15.5% vs. 15.7%—negligible difference once leverage effect removed.

### Turnover Ratios: Detecting Asset Quality Problems

**The underlying notion**: Company requires certain level of receivables and inventory to support given sales volume. Material deviations signal problems.

**Receivables turnover** = Annual sales ÷ [(A/R beginning + A/R ending) ÷ 2]

**Average days of receivables** = [(Average A/R) ÷ Annual sales] × 365

**Decline in turnover signals**:
- Customers paying more slowly (encountering financial difficulties)
- Company liberalizing credit standards (doing more business with less capable customers who pay slowly)

**Either way**: Ultimate collectability of A/R has become less certain. Unless company increased allowance for doubtful receivables, may have to write off portion against income in future. **Analyst should adjust total-debt-to-total-capital for implicit overstatement of equity.**

**Inventory turnover** = Annual sales ÷ [(Inventory beginning + Inventory ending) ÷ 2]

**Preferred variant** = Annual COGS ÷ [(Inventory beginning + Inventory ending) ÷ 2]

**Why COGS preferred**: Using sales in numerator creates distortion when selling prices fluctuate (commodity chemical price spike raises sales and turnover, yet not physically moving inventory faster). **COGS and inventory both based on historical cost, more closely capturing physical turnover reality.**

**Declining turnover signals**:
- Unsalable inventory (fashion leftovers, obsolete finished goods) worth far less than balance sheet values
- Drop in sales not yet reflected in production cuts

**The sales drop scenario**: Until inventory glut worked off, company may borrow to finance unusually high working capital (increasing leverage). Profitability may suffer as company cuts prices to eliminate excess.

### Cash Conversion Cycle: The Working Capital Efficiency Measure

**Formula** = DIO + DSO − DPO

Where:
- **DIO (Days Inventory Outstanding)** = [(Average inventory) ÷ COGS] × 365
- **DSO (Days Sales Outstanding)** = [(Average A/R) ÷ Revenue per day]
- **DPO (Days Payables Outstanding)** = [(Average A/P) ÷ COGS per day]

**What it measures**: Number of days required to convert working capital items (inventory, receivables, payables) into cash. Lower number = more efficient = less capital tied up in operations.

**Why it matters for equity investors**:
- Company with significantly more days than industry peers ties up more capital for same revenue
- Requires more financing (either debt or equity), reducing returns
- Extended cycle can signal problems: slow-moving inventory, customer payment difficulties, or inability to negotiate favorable payment terms with suppliers
- Rapidly deteriorating cycle often precedes cash flow problems

**Cause for concern**: Company has significantly more days in cash conversion cycle than comparable companies in industry.

### Total Debt to Cash Flow: The Best Single Measure

**Formula** = (Short-term debt + Current maturities + Long-term debt) ÷ Cash flow from operations

**Alternative** = (Short-term debt + Current maturities + Long-term debt) ÷ EBITDA
*(Less precise but commonly used)*

**The literal interpretation**: Company with $60M debt and $20M cash flow has ability to liquidate all debt in 3 years dedicating 100% of cash flow. Clearly greater flexibility than company with $80M debt and $10M cash flow (8-year payback).

**The reality**: Very few companies dedicate 100% of cash flow to debt retirement, but **ratio still excellent to monitor because it's built from two comparatively hard numbers:**
- Total-debt-to-total-capital has inherent flaw that equity may be misstated relative to economic value
- Fixed-charge coverage based on earnings subject to considerable manipulation
- Cash flow eliminates major manipulation opportunity: under-depreciation (merely taking money from one pocket and putting in other)

**Don't worry about whether literal interpretation is realistic—focus on analytical value.**

## Investment Application: The Disciplined Credit Analyst's Approach

**1. Never rely on financial statements alone**:
- Check payment history and track record
- Assess competitive environment and industry dynamics
- Identify any credit support (guarantees, implicit backing)
- Consider management's historical attitude toward debt

**2. Calculate leverage comprehensively**:
- Include permanent short-term debt, not just long-term
- Count convertible debt (until actually converted)
- Treat preferred stock as partial debt (fixed obligations)
- Attribute proportionate (or full, if critical) share of JV/subsidiary debt
- Add deferred taxes to capital (if deferrals truly permanent)

**3. Listen for the escape clause**:
- When management pledges conservative policies during debt offering, note any "unless once-in-a-lifetime acquisition..." qualifiers
- Assume that shortly after deal closes, the opportunity will materialize
- Track whether management follows through on stated deleveraging plans

**4. Use combination ratios as checks**:
- High ROE from leverage shows as low fixed-charge coverage
- Return on total capital equalizes for capital structure differences
- Declining receivables/inventory turnover signals asset quality problems even if earnings look fine
- Cash conversion cycle flags working capital inefficiency relative to peers

**5. Prioritize cash flow measures**:
- Total debt to cash flow = best single measure (hard numbers, less manipulable)
- Free cash flow shows ability to sustain operations without external financing
- Cash flow to capex reveals financial flexibility (but interpret changes carefully)
- Capex to depreciation flags gradual liquidation (<1.0) or growth investment needs

**6. Make critical adjustments**:
- Eliminate extraordinary items from margins and coverage ratios
- Add capitalized interest to coverage denominator
- Include operating lease obligations (full rentals or 1/3 representing interest)
- Use trailing 12-month figures for interim periods, not simple doubling

**7. Remember the temporal distinction**:
- EBITDA coverage: short-to-intermediate-term ability to pay interest
- EBIT coverage: truer measure of long-term sustainability
- Over full cycle, companies must replace depreciating/amortizing assets

**Above all**: **Credit analysis requires looking ahead.** When management's probable future actions are taken into account, company's prospects for repaying debts may be better or worse than ratios imply. Cannot afford to take management representations at face value. Ask for specifics: What's the action plan? Which steps achieved so far? What's the escape clause?
