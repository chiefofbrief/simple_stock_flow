# Chapter 8: The Applications and Limitations of EBITDA

## OBJECTIVE

EBITDA emerged not as the single "correct" measure of profitability that investors sought, but as a useful tool for specific contexts. **The metric has legitimate applications in neutralizing capital structure differences and assessing capital intensity, but becomes dangerous when treated as comprehensive cash flow or used as sole measure of creditworthiness.** The search for a single metric that captures all financial performance is as futile as conquistadors searching for El Dorado. Companies inevitably game whatever ratio analysts fixate on, making diverse analysis essential.

## The Quest for Comparability: Why EBITDA Emerged

Two companies in the same industry can report similar net income yet have substantially different total enterprise values. Similarly, they can generate similar income levels to cover similar interest expense yet represent highly dissimilar default risks. The EPS figure, despite investor obsession, was not a standard by which every company's value and risk could be fairly compared.

**The fundamental insight**: No single measure can capture financial performance comprehensively enough to fulfill such a role. Yet instead of accepting this, analysts searched for the "correct" single measure with the fervor of conquistadors seeking El Dorado.

## Legitimate Use #1: Neutralizing Capital Structure in Valuations

**The problem**: Applying single P/E multiple across potential acquisition targets ignores that incumbent managements' financial strategies will cease being relevant post-acquisition.

**Example**: Deep Hock Corporation (45% debt-to-capital) and Breathing Room Inc. (debt-free) both have $30.4M operating income. At 25× net income, Breathing Room valued at $600M vs. Deep Hock at $495M. Yet Deep Hock's higher return on equity (18% vs. 12%) simply reflects leverage choice that acquirer can change.

**The EBIT solution**: Applying 20× EBIT multiple produces same $608M valuation for both, removing capital structure differences. Acquirer can add debt to Breathing Room's subsidiary or retire Deep Hock's debt post-acquisition.

**The EBITDA refinement**: LBO firms in 1980s evaluated targets without respect to existing capital structure *or* major non-cash charges (depreciation, amortization). Over 5-year LBO timeframe, company might direct cash flow primarily to debt paydown without impairing long-run competitiveness, even if this meant deferring some asset replacement.

**The depreciation manipulation defense**: If target uses liberal depreciation to inflate earnings, adding back depreciation puts it on equal footing with more conservative company. Company lengthening asset lives from 8 to 10 years can boost net income $19M (worth $494M at 26× P/E), but EBITDA remains unchanged at $397M—eliminating gaming opportunity.

## Legitimate Use #2: Discriminating Capital Intensity in Credit Analysis

**The insight**: Conventional fixed charge coverage can be nearly identical for two companies (Rock Solid 3.62×, Hollowman 3.58×) that differ significantly in default probability during downturns.

**The downturn reveals stark difference**:
- **Rock Solid**: EBITDA coverage 1.29× (still covers interest despite negative EBIT)
- **Hollowman**: EBITDA coverage -0.67× (insolvent even with depreciation cushion)

Rock Solid survives because it has $75M noncash depreciation available to pay $58M interest. Hollowman has only $30M depreciation against $53M interest.

**The underlying difference**: Depreciation represents 4.2% of Rock Solid's operating expenses vs. 1.9% for Hollowman, indicating Rock Solid is more capital-intensive with larger percentage of assets in PP&E. **This cushion matters during downturns.**

**Application**: EBITDA enables analysts to discriminate between credits that look similarly risky by conventional measures but differ in capital intensity—second legitimate reason for ratio's popularity alongside acquisition comparability.

## The Critical Limitation: Depreciation Not Truly Available Long-Term

**The hidden assumption**: Adding depreciation to numerator is appropriate *only* for period over which company can defer substantial capital spending without impairing future competitiveness.

**The reality**: Over full operating cycle, capital expenditures ordinarily *at least equal* depreciation charges. Company must repair physical wear and tear. Additional outlays required for replacing obsolete equipment. Capital spending likely *exceeds* depreciation over time due to:
- Expansion to accommodate rising demand
- Inflation making new equipment costlier than old equipment being written off

**The temporary safety valve principle**: D in EBITDA is cushion corporate treasurer can use if EBIT falls below I *for limited time*. Company can temporarily reduce capital spending, freeing up depreciation cash flow for interest. Delaying essential-but-not-urgent equipment purchases should inflict no lasting damage if profit slump lasts only few quarters. **But most companies would lose competitive edge if spending only bare minimum on PP&E year after year.**

**The 1980s LBO lesson**: Sponsors reassured nervous investors with EBITDA coverage >1.0× even when projected EBIT wouldn't cover interest in good year. Claimed prior management overspent on ego projects, but subsequent wave of LBO bond defaults vindicated skeptics. **Depreciation was not, after all, available as long-run source of cash for interest payments.**

## The Single-Ratio Fallacy: No Silver Bullet Exists

**The mistaken belief**: Many practitioners now consider EBITDA synonymous with "cash flow" or "operating cash flow," troubling given long tradition of empirical research linking *genuine* cash flow to bankruptcy risk.

**Beaver's 1966 finding**: Best single predictor of bankruptcy was declining trend in (Net Income + Depreciation) ÷ Total Debt. This made intuitive sense—risk increases if income declines or debt increases.

**The critical misapplication**: Bond analysts developed tradition of telescoping default risk into single ratio of "cash flow" (EBITDA) ÷ Total Debt, all based on Beaver's finding. **But Beaver never advocated relying exclusively on this ratio**—merely that it was single best predictor among those tested.

**The multivariate reality**: Just two years after Beaver (1968), Edward Altman introduced Z-Score combining five ratios with greater predictive power. Since 1968, there has been no excuse for reducing bankruptcy risk to sole measure of EBITDA ÷ Total Debt. **Yet that procedure remains common shorthand for credit risk.**

**The bizarre modern practice**: Investment managers sometimes ask analysts for "actual credit risk" rankings (as opposed to ratings agency rankings), defining "actual risk" as EBITDA coverage. They apparently consider it self-evident that single ratio predicts bankruptcy better than all rating agencies' quantitative and qualitative considerations combined. **They're setting credit analysis back more than half a century.**

## The W.T. Grant Lesson: Working Capital Matters

At time of 1975 bankruptcy filing, W.T. Grant was largest retailer in United States. Up until two years before collapse, reported positive net income *and* positive stable cash flow (net income + depreciation). In 1973, stock traded at 20× earnings; board authorized dividends until mid-1974. **Traditional cash flow measures gave no warning.**

**What investors missed**: Looking beyond income statement's cash sources (earnings, depreciation) and uses (interest, dividends) to investigate whether inventories and accounts receivable were tying up increasing cash. Need to determine whether company could generate offsetting cash by expanding payables.

**The FASB response** (SFAS 95, 1987): More comprehensive definition:

**Operating Cash Flow = Net Income + Depreciation - Changes in Working Capital Requirements**

Where: **Working Capital Requirements = Accounts Receivable + Inventory - Accounts Payable**

(Focuses on elements growing roughly proportional with operations; excludes cash, marketable securities, short-term debt)

## How Working Capital Reveals Manipulation

**The principle**: Aside from seasonal variations, working capital needed to run business represents fairly constant percentage of sales. **Material increase in inventories or receivables as percentage of sales is red flag.**

### The Inventory Warning

**Apparel manufacturer scenario**: Management guesses wrong on fashion trend. Holds unfashionable inventory that can be sold, if at all, only at knockdown prices. Instead of recognizing loss, retains in finished goods inventory. May persuade auditors no loss occurred (fashion is subjective, or temporary slowdown in orders).

**The detection**: While current season's goods remain unsold, company produces next season's clothing. Inventory rises, causing working capital requirements to increase. **According to FASB definition, rise in working capital requirements reduces operating cash flow**—analysts receive danger signal even though net income + depreciation advances steadily. EBITDA-focused analysts have no inkling.

### The Receivables Warning

Surge in accounts receivable would similarly reduce operating cash flow, signaling:

**Possibility 1 - Liberalized credit**: Propping up sales by giving existing customers more time to pay. Carrying financially strained businesses. Average receivables higher than past. Soaks up more cash, forces company to absorb financing costs formerly borne by customers.

**Possibility 2 - Lower quality customers**: Extension of credit to new, less creditworthy customers paying slowly. Company ought to increase bad debt reserve, reducing current income. **If they don't, cash flow measure including working capital reveals weakness not detected by EBITDA.**

**The payables masking attempt**: Management may try pumping up accounts payable (taking longer to pay bills) to offset asset-side increases. But companies think twice because suppliers might view slowdown as financial weakness, causing vital trade credit to dry up.

**The multi-ratio defense**: If company stretches payables, other ratios (receivables ÷ sales, inventories ÷ COGS—see Chapter 13) send warning signals anyway. If doesn't finance bulge through payables or drawing down cash, must add borrowings. Rising debt-to-capital ratio confirms adverse trend revealed by operating cash flow.

## The Gaming Dynamic: Why Single Metrics Fail

**The inevitable pattern**: Investors migrate toward less variable measures (operating earnings stabler than reported earnings, EBIT stabler than operating, EBITDA stabler than EBIT) because investors reward stability with high P/E multiples. Trend reached logical conclusion in late-1990s tech boom when investors valued stocks on price-sales ratios—highest, most stable figure of all.

**The enduring principle**: Reducing analysis to single financial ratio, although alluring as labor-saving device, is unwise. **Once corporate managers discover which ratio analysts focus on single-mindedly, they devote massive time and energy to gaming that metric.**

**The multi-ratio advantage**: Considering variety of ratios improves analysis simply because companies' efforts to dress up premier ratio cause others to weaken. **When delayed write-offs of stale inventory flatter earnings, they bloat inventory ÷ COGS ratio.**

## Investment Application: Using EBITDA Properly

**1. Recognize legitimate contexts**:
- Acquisition valuation: Neutralizing capital structure differences is valid
- Credit analysis: Discriminating capital intensity provides useful insight during downturns
- Countering depreciation manipulation: Adding back depreciation levels playing field

**2. Never use as sole measure**:
- EBITDA ÷ Total Debt tells only part of story
- Multivariate models (Altman Z-Score) demonstrably superior to single ratios
- Rating agency comprehensive analysis beats any single metric

**3. Always incorporate working capital**:
- Track receivables ÷ sales and inventories ÷ COGS trends
- Calculate OCF = Net Income + Depreciation - Δ Working Capital Requirements
- Material increases in receivables or inventory as % of sales = red flag

**4. Understand the depreciation reality**:
- D in EBITDA is temporary safety valve, not permanent interest coverage
- Over full cycle, capex ≥ depreciation (usually exceeds due to growth + inflation)
- Sustainable only for limited period without impairing competitiveness

**5. Watch for "Adjusted EBITDA" abuse**:
- Some adjustments make sense (genuine one-time events, bona fide synergies)
- Less defensible: "run rate" from single month annualized (seasonal/special event skew)
- Question aggressively what's being excluded and why

**6. Diversify your analytical toolkit**:
- Use EBITDA as one of many diagnostic tools
- Combine with debt ratios, coverage ratios, working capital trends
- When one metric improves suspiciously, check whether others deteriorate

**Above all**: Resist the El Dorado quest for single perfect metric. **No measure captures all pertinent financial traits.** Companies game whatever you fixate on. Your defense is analytical diversity—when they dress up one ratio, others reveal the manipulation.
