# Chapter 5: What is Profit?

## OBJECTIVE

The fundamental question in financial analysis is not "what did the company report as profit?" but rather "did the company actually generate profit?" Chapter 5 establishes the critical distinction between **bona fide profits** (genuine increases in wealth) and **accounting profits** (whatever GAAP declares as profit). These two measures can diverge dramatically, and understanding when and why is essential to avoiding value traps.

## THE WEALTH TEST: The Only Litmus Test That Matters

The simple formula Revenue − Costs becomes meaningless without a fundamental principle:

**After a company earns a bona fide profit, its owners are wealthier than they were beforehand.**

This is non-negotiable. There can be no bona fide profit without an increase in wealth. Bona fide profits are the only kind that truly matter in financial analysis.

**Accounting profits**, by contrast, have a practical definition that reveals their limitation:

**An accounting profit is whatever the accounting rules say it is.**

If during a stated interval a business adds nothing to its owners' wealth but the accounting rules state that it has earned a profit, that satisfies many stock market investors. They cheerfully assign a price-earnings multiple to any number that a reputable accounting firm declares to be profit—even when it reflects no genuine wealth creation.

## The Circular Cash Flow Trap

**Salsa Meister International** illustrates how GAAP can manufacture accounting profits from nothing:

The franchise company:
1. Sells stock to the public
2. Lends proceeds to franchisees (who operate money-losing restaurants)
3. Franchisees send cash right back as "franchise fees"
4. Company accepts fees, renames them "revenue"
5. GAAP declares this a profit
6. Investors apply a P/E multiple to the accounting profit
7. Company raises more stock, and the cycle repeats

**The astute analyst's insight**: Cutting through form to substance, Salsa Meister's wealth has not increased. Cash simply circulated from shareholders → company → franchisees → company, undergoing name changes along the way. **Merely circulating funds does not increase wealth.**

When investors realize this, the company loses its ability to manufacture accounting profits by raising capital. The stock price falls to its intrinsic value—zero.

**Investment principle**: Always ask whether reported profits truly reflect increases in wealth. Accounting profits sometimes differ radically from bona fide profits.

## The Non-GAAP Proliferation: Navigating Competing Versions of Earnings

Willingness to question GAAP figures is essential, but once analysts leave the GAAP world of agreed-upon rules, they enter a "free market of ideas where numerous parties hawk competing versions of earnings."

**The explosion**: By 2017, 97% of S&P 500 companies included non-GAAP measures in earnings releases, up from just over half two decades earlier. Average number of non-GAAP items rose from 2 to over 7 between 1996 and 2016.

**Why the proliferation?** Accounting reforms of the 1990s rendered GAAP earnings much more volatile by shifting items from historical cost to fair value accounting. Asset prices incorporated estimates of future profits as well as currently realized earnings, making reported earnings more procyclical and less correlated with stock price movements. Analysts had little choice but to pay greater attention to companies' non-GAAP figures.

**Regulatory response**: SEC Regulation G doesn't prohibit non-GAAP metrics but requires companies to:
- Explain why they're providing the metric
- Quantitatively reconcile it with the most comparable GAAP metric
- Present the GAAP metric at least as prominently as the non-GAAP one

**The danger**: Many issuers exploit dissatisfaction with GAAP by encouraging analysts to adopt earnings measures that make profits appear higher than either accounting profits or bona fide profits. In 2020, some companies introduced "EBITDAC" (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization, and coronavirus), turning a 16% earnings decline into a 20% increase.

## When to Ignore Depreciation (And When It's Dangerous)

The archetype for alternative earnings measures adds back depreciation. As far back as 1930, investment experts argued:

> "Depreciation, after all, is a purely accounting item, and can be adjusted, within limits, to show such net earnings as are desired. Therefore it would seem preferable for the investor to obtain, if possible, earnings before depreciation, and to make his own estimate of depreciation."

**Critical nuance**: The author does not dispute depreciation's relevance to calculating earnings. Rather, he objects that it's too malleable—issuers can raise or lower reported earnings by assuming shorter or longer asset lives. The necessary adjustment is to *increase* depreciation and thereby *reduce* earnings, not to ignore it altogether.

### The Real Estate Exception

Private real estate investors provide the template for when ignoring depreciation makes sense:

**The paradox**:
- Annual rental revenue offsets out-of-pocket expenses (maintenance, repairs, property taxes, interest)
- Before depreciation: breaking even
- After depreciation (noncash expense): showing annual losses
- Result: Reduced income tax bills despite breakeven cash operations
- After several years: Sells property for more than originally invested
- **Conclusion**: Owner is wealthier (bona fide profit) despite reporting losses every year

**The rational explanation**: Tax code depreciation rates overstate actual wear and tear. Buildings may get depreciated several times over their typically very long lives. This disparity creates a subsidy for real estate investment—or testament to real estate operators' influence over legislators.

**The analytical adjustment**: Conventional income statements provide a "cockeyed view" of real estate profitability. A closer approximation ignores depreciation altogether and focuses on **cash-on-cash profit**—the sum laid out at the beginning versus the bigger sum taken out at the end, plus tax savings generated during ownership.

### The Broadcasting Exception

Broadcasting businesses show similar patterns. When a company buys a radio or television station:
- Price reflects comparatively small plant and equipment component
- Larger portion derives from exclusive right to utilize broadcasting spectrum
- This scarce resource tends to become more valuable over time
- May show perennial losses after depreciation
- Yet realizes handsome profit when finally selling the station

**The analytical metric**: **Broadcast cash flow** = Operating income + Depreciation and amortization + Corporate overhead

(More meticulous calculation deducts cash outlays for acquiring new programming while adding back amortization of previously acquired programming; both found on cash flow statement.)

### The Dangerous False Analogy

**Critical warning**: Ignoring depreciation should be used with discretion. In many industries, fixed assets consist mainly of machines or vehicles that genuinely diminish in value through use.

**The major risk**: Reported depreciation substantially *understates* rather than overstates economic depreciation.

Through false analogy with real estate and broadcasting, any marginally unprofitable company in a capital-intensive business can declare itself profitable by simply proclaiming analysts should no longer consider depreciation. **Supposed earnings generated this way qualify as neither accounting profits nor bona fide profits.**

## The Analyst's Tightrope Walk

Financial analysts must walk a fine line:

**On one hand**: Must not lose touch with economic reality by hewing to accounting orthodoxy. GAAP earnings can be calculated in perfect accordance with rules yet bear little relation to an investor's rate of return.

**On the other hand**: Must not accept the version of reality that seekers of cheap capital would foist on them.

**The balanced approach**:
- Exercise care in deciding what to substitute for GAAP definitions of profit
- Be discriminating in use of alternative presentations—but recognize the same applies to GAAP numbers
- Be skeptical of claims that a business's alleged costs are "mere accounting conventions"
- Reject the notion that anyone who believes costs matter is a "fuddy-duddy"

**Fundamental principle**: Willingness to take accounting profits at something other than face value is essential to genuinely useful financial statement analysis. But analysts must be equally skeptical of management-promoted alternatives that suspiciously eliminate costs to manufacture higher "earnings."

## Investment Application: The Due Diligence Questions

When evaluating reported profits, systematically ask:

1. **The wealth test**: Are the company's owners actually wealthier after this period's operations? Or have accounting conventions manufactured profit where none exists economically?

2. **Cash flow verification**: Do reported earnings convert to cash? Or are they built on circular flows, uncollected receivables, or deferred billings?

3. **Non-GAAP scrutiny**: When companies promote adjusted earnings:
   - What specific costs are being excluded?
   - Are these genuinely one-time events or recurring operating costs?
   - Does the non-GAAP metric exclude real economic costs?
   - How does the adjustment compare to industry peers?

4. **Depreciation reality check**: For companies emphasizing metrics that exclude depreciation:
   - What is the nature of their fixed assets?
   - Do these assets genuinely appreciate (spectrum rights, real estate) or depreciate (machinery, vehicles)?
   - Is this a valid exception like broadcasting/real estate, or a false analogy?
   - Will assets require replacement, and at what cost?

5. **The business model test**: Does the profit calculation reflect the economic reality of how this business actually creates value?
