# Chapter 2: The Balance Sheet

## OBJECTIVE

The balance sheet's two fundamental shortcomings create both risks and opportunities for equity analysts. First, asset values are frequently elusive in practice despite being theoretically useful. Second, many valuable things cannot be assigned specific values and recorded on the balance sheet. **The widening gap between book value and economic value—FAANG stocks' book values represent just 3-15% of market capitalizations—means analysts must look beyond stated figures to assess true equity value.** Understanding when balance sheet values overstate or understate economic reality is essential to avoiding value traps and identifying mispriced securities.

## The Widening Value Gap: When Balance Sheets Don't Reflect Reality

**The historical trend**: Between 1978 and 1999, book value fell from 95% to 71% of stock market value for U.S. public companies. By early 2021, FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Alphabet) showed book values per share ranging from 3% to 15% of market capitalizations. These five stocks alone accounted for about 15% of the S&P 500's total value.

**The underlying cause**: Investors increasingly pay for things GAAP doesn't capture—brand names built over decades, internally developed technology, customer relationships, network effects. Traditional accounting grew up around tangible assets (buildings, machinery, inventories) but struggles to reflect value created by intellectual capital.

**The analytical implication**: Can't rely on book value multiples alone when evaluating businesses where primary value derives from intangibles. Must assess economic moats, competitive positioning, and earnings power separately from balance sheet figures.

## Historical Cost: Objectivity With Major Blind Spots

**The core advantage**: Cost of acquiring or constructing an asset is objective, verifiable figure compatible with accounting conservatism. No need to wrestle with competing theories of intrinsic value.

**The intangible problem**: Company A's brand names and merchant relationships built over many years never appear on balance sheet because they've never figured in a transaction. When Company B acquires Company A at premium to book value, intangibles suddenly recognized as goodwill. Result: Company A's balance sheet now says it's more valuable than Company C, which has equivalent tangible and intangible assets but has never been acquired.

**The specialized asset challenge**: Even objectively measurable historical cost doesn't equal economic value. Consider specialized machinery purchased for $50,000:
- Buyer perceives it worth at least $50,000 (or wouldn't purchase)
- Secured lender takes more conservative view (few comparables, hard to monitor, limited buyers in foreclosure)
- Transportation and reinstallation costs reduce liquidation value further
- **Similar issues with commodity reserves**: Oil wells can begin producing at predicted rates then peter out early, yielding fraction of estimated reserves. Estimation relies heavily on judgment and inference.

**The environmental shift problem**: Large-scale shift from coal to natural gas produced huge write-downs. Peabody Energy's U.S. thermal coal mining asset values dropped 52% in first half of 2020. **Analysts must monitor returns companies earn on assets to ascertain whether accounting-based values remain durable.**

## Fair Value Accounting: The "Assumptions About Assumptions" Problem

**When it works well**: Financial assets trading daily in well-organized markets (NYSE) can be valued based on market quotations. Achieves both objectivity and accuracy.

**When it creates manipulation opportunities**:

**Level 1 - Direct quotes**: Active market exists, use market price.

**Level 2 - Similar assets**: No active market, determine value based on quoted prices for similar actively traded assets. Must make assumptions about how market would adjust for differences. Room for liberal interpretation.

**Level 3 - Assumptions about assumptions**: No comparables exist. Company uses its own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use. **Users of financial statements can reasonably expect some companies' assumptions about assumptions will be on liberal side, potentially inflating asset values.** Abuse of this discretion was element of Enron fraud.

### The Intent-Based Classification Game

**SFAS 115 compromise** (1993): Financial instruments valued according to intended use by company issuing statements:

1. **Held-to-maturity**: Debt security at amortized cost less impairment
2. **Trading security**: Fair value, unrealized gains/losses in earnings
3. **Available for sale**: Fair value, but unrealized gains/losses excluded from earnings (reported in other comprehensive income)

**The critical flaw**: Identical asset may be valued at substantially different values on different companies' balance sheets, all based on representations of intentions. Even possible for asset to be carried at two different values on single balance sheet (university endowment as limited partner in company held by multiple private equity funds that place different values on identical shares).

**Lehman Brothers example**: Each trading desk had its own asset pricing methodology. Methodologies differed even within single asset class. Some dubious—based Q2 2008 prices on Morgan Stanley research note from Q1.

## Early Warning Signals: Detecting Impairment Before Official Write-Downs

Don't wait for accountants to make it official. Adjust company's balance sheet to reflect telltale signs of overstatement.

### Caterpillar / ERA: The Working Capital Crisis Pattern

**The official story** (January 2013): Caterpillar took ~$580M goodwill impairment charge on June 2012 acquisition of ERA Mining Machinery. Attributed to "deliberate, multi-year, coordinated accounting misconduct."

**What due diligence should have caught**:
- **A/R up 37%** from 2010 to 2011 vs. **sales up only 10%**
- **Inventory up 234%** (not yet shifted to customers)
- Directors lending company cash to keep lid on borrowing costs when China's economy slowed
- March 2012 profit warning: Rising raw material costs and swelling bad debt allowance

**The underlying problem**: ERA had to offer customers credit and favorable terms to compete with state-owned rivals. Caterpillar acquisition would bring cheaper financing but wouldn't solve basic competitive problem.

### GE / Alstom: Paying $10B for −$7B Net Worth

**The transaction** (2015): GE paid $10B for France's Alstom power equipment businesses.

**The accounting** (2016, one year later):
- Gross assets: $21B
- Liabilities: $23B
- **Net worth: −$7B**
- Goodwill created: $17B ($10B paid − (−$7B) net worth)

**The justification**: Expected synergy (possibly the most dangerous word in finance), including cross-selling opportunities.

**The write-off** (2018): Just three years later, GE wrote down $17B attributed to Alstom (exceeded $10B paid) plus $6B of other assets. CEO remarked if GE had time machine, would pay far less—then was ousted.

**Why this keeps happening**: Until 2000 in U.S. (2005 in Europe), acquirers had to amortize goodwill year-by-year, reducing reported profits. With requirement removed, corporate CEOs can "buy earnings" and boost growth-based bonuses even on mediocre businesses acquired at excessive prices. Total goodwill on S&P 500 balance sheets ballooned from $1.8T to $2.9T. Write-down-triggering impairment test (deterioration in expected future cash flows) can be gamed—day of reckoning deferred while unwary investors have inflated notion of asset value.

## The Goodwill Skepticism Principle: Stock-for-Stock Alchemy

Rating agencies bucked New Economy trend by attaching greater significance to ratios ignoring intangible assets. When Tech Bubble burst (2001) producing multibillion-dollar goodwill write-offs, they didn't equate accounting changes with reduced lender protection.

### How Stock Rally Magically "Improves" Credit Quality

Consider two companies:
- **Associated Amalgamator**: $200M equity, 1.25× total assets/total liabilities
- **United Consolidator**: $60M equity, 1.18× total assets/total liabilities

**Scenario I** (stocks trading at 1.0× book value):
- Amalgamator pays $80M (33⅓% premium) to acquire Consolidator
- Creates $20M goodwill
- Combined ratio: 1.25× (no deterioration despite acquiring weaker company)

**Scenario II** (stocks rally to 1.5× book value):
- Same companies, same fundamental ratios
- Amalgamator pays $120M (33⅓% premium on higher market cap)
- Creates $60M goodwill
- Combined ratio: **1.28×** (higher than Amalgamator's standalone 1.25×!)

**The absurd implication**: Simplest way to improve credit quality is making stock-for-stock acquisitions at grossly excessive prices.

**The reality check**: Exclude goodwill. Amalgamator's **tangible assets/total liabilities = 1.23× in both scenarios**—the outcome reflecting economic reality.

**Why goodwill deserves skepticism**: Unlike inventories or receivables, goodwill cannot be readily sold, factored to raise cash, or used in sale-leaseback. Not separable asset management can convert to cash in tight spot. Therefore, relevance to asset protection analysis is questionable. **Credit analysts must calculate balance sheet ratios both with and without goodwill, giving greater emphasis to tangibles-only version.**

## Adjusting Book Value for Underperforming Companies

**The wealth test**: If investors willing to accept 8% return on Company Z when 14% return available on other stocks, there's no obvious reason they'd voluntarily make such sacrifice. Book value likely overstated.

**The adjustment formula**:

**Adjusted equity value** = Average earnings ÷ Industry average ROE

**Example**:
- Company Z: $24M average net income (5-year), $300M shareholders' equity
- S&P 400 industrials: 14% average return
- **Adjusted equity**: $24M ÷ 14% = $171M
- **Implied write-down**: $129M (43% reduction)

**Subtleties this neglects**: (1) Company may be riskier than average, demanding higher return; (2) Cash flow may better indicate performance; (3) Investors focus on expected future earnings, not past; (4) Peer group expected returns may differ from historical. But rough adjustment better than accepting stated book value at face value.

## Case Study: Celadon—How Book Value Can Overstate by 25×

**The setup**: Celadon Group (12th largest U.S. truckload trucker) generally valued by analysts at 1× tangible book value. Celadon reported TBV of $10.80/share; stock traded at $6.25. Prescience Point Research (April 2017) concluded true TBV was $0.42/share, valued stock at zero.

**Vindication**: Less than month later, stock at $1.55 (down 75%). By end 2019: bankruptcy, delisting, shares <$0.02. Former subsidiary president pleaded guilty to fraud; two superiors indicted.

### Detection Method 1: The Sham Daylight Loan

**Background**: Celadon formed 50/50 JV with Element Fleet Management. Previously had agreed to cover up to 10% of Element's tractor purchase losses and interim lease shortfalls. When used tractor prices plummeted (late 2015), Celadon shelled out $74M for losses + $31.9M for shortfalls.

**The reported JV structure**:
- Element contributed: $100M equity
- Celadon contributed: $100M equity ($36.4M cash + $63.6M equipment)
- Celadon valued 50% stake at $100M

**What 10-Q exhibit revealed**:
- Element made $31.8M "Daylight Loan" to JV
- JV advanced money to Celadon
- Celadon "contributed" it back to JV
- JV immediately repaid Daylight Loan

**Conclusion**: Sham loan created false appearance of recovery. Celadon's actual equity contribution was $68.2M, not $100M.

### Detection Method 2: Depreciation Rate Comparison

**Element's contributed equipment**: Valued at $567.6M but under-depreciated by $171.5M per Prescience Point.

| Metric | Element | Celadon | Peers |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| Annual depreciation rate | 6.4% | 15% | 15-17% |
| Implied useful life | 15 years | 4 years | ~4-6 years |

**Impact**: $171.5M overvaluation exceeded sum of Element's $100M stated contribution plus Celadon's $68.2M valid contribution. **JV had no actual equity value. Celadon's $100M stake overstated by $100M.**

### Detection Method 3: Classic Warning Signs

- Celadon inflated TBV further by extending useful lives of tractors and trailers
- 2012: KPMG required restatement
- 2013: Celadon fired KPMG, hired regional auditor BKD
- Fiscal 2014-2016: Audit fees increased **179.6%**
- Pattern: Outsized audit fees appeared in Enron and Satyam frauds (can compromise auditor independence)

**Management reaction**: Brushed off criticisms, alleged Prescience Point was short. One analyst urged buying the dip—ill-timed before 55% one-day drop on May 2.

## Market Capitalization: Useful Tool With Limitations

### The Advantages

- **Consensus of informed observers**: Large numbers of analysts and investors constantly monitoring future prospects
- **Real-time updates**: Can calculate any day exchange is open vs. balance sheet updated quarterly
- **Instantaneous adjustment**: Responds immediately to news (competitor product launches, plant explosions, Fed rate hikes)

### The Limitations

**Short-term volatility may not reflect fundamentals**: February 5, 2018, Boeing dropped 5.7%, losing $20B market value. No major negative news that day; analysts had recently raised earnings estimates. Ten days later, shares fully recovered.

**Behavioral finance findings**: Extensive academic research shows market prices frequently overreact to news events. Stock market far more volatile than variability of dividends can explain. Short-run swings can reveal more about stock market dynamics than changes in company's earnings prospects.

**Private company limitation**: Only obtainable for public companies. For private companies, typically multiply peer group average P/E by private company's earnings. Limitation: Fails to capture company-specific factors.

## The Common Form Balance Sheet: Detecting Subtle Shifts

**The technique**: Convert each asset to percentage of total assets, each liability/equity component to percentage of total liabilities and shareholders' equity.

**Why it matters**: Deterioration can occur gradually and be reported suddenly. Many companies alter asset mix or financing methods gradually.

**What to watch**:
- **Inventory % rising**: Involuntary buildup from sales slowdown
- **A/R % rising**: Increasing reliance on credit extension to generate sales
- **PP&E % rising**: Business becoming more capital-intensive → fixed costs rising → earnings more volatile

## Investment Application: The Flexible Approach to Book Value

**1. Understand the gap between book value and economic value**:
- FAANG stocks: Book value just 3-15% of market cap
- Must separately assess economic moats, competitive positioning, earnings power
- Don't rely on book value multiples for businesses where value derives from intangibles

**2. Calculate asset protection using tangible assets only**:
- Follow rating agency practice: Calculate ratios both with and without goodwill
- Give greater emphasis to tangibles-only version
- Remember: Goodwill can't be sold, factored, or used in sale-leaseback

**3. Watch for early warning signals of impairment**:
- **Working capital warnings**: A/R or inventory rising much faster than sales (Caterpillar: 37% vs 10%)
- **Director loans** to cover borrowing costs when business slows
- **Profit warnings** citing rising costs and bad debt allowances
- **Paying for negative net worth** justified by "synergies" (GE paid $10B for −$7B)

**4. Use depreciation rates as fraud detection tool**:
- Compare assumptions to industry peers
- Celadon JV partner: 6.4% annual (15-year life) vs. peers' 15-17% (4-6 year life)
- Watch for useful life extensions when company under earnings pressure

**5. Investigate off-balance-sheet structures**:
- Check 10-Q/10-K exhibits for subscription agreements (Celadon Daylight Loan)
- Verify partner asset valuations using depreciation comparisons
- Calculate whether JV actually has positive equity value

**6. Red flags for auditor relationships**:
- Firing top-tier auditor after restatement requirement
- Audit fees increasing dramatically (Celadon: 179.6% over 3 years)
- Pattern appeared in Enron and Satyam frauds

**7. Adjust book value for chronically underperforming companies**:
- Formula: Average earnings ÷ Industry average ROE
- If earning 8% while industry earns 14%, book value likely overstated
- Recognize limitations but better than accepting stated value

**8. Use appropriate equity measure for specific task**:
- **Covenant compliance**: Stated balance sheet figures (contractually defined)
- **Liquidation analysis**: Current market valuation more relevant than historical cost
- **Sale proceeds**: Neither book nor market cap will equal actual proceeds precisely

**9. Leverage market cap appropriately**:
- Excellent for real-time value tracking of public companies
- Be skeptical of dramatic short-term swings (may reflect market dynamics, not fundamentals)
- For private companies, peer P/E multiples provide rough proxy but miss company-specific factors

**10. Use common form balance sheet for trend detection**:
- Track asset mix changes quarter-to-quarter
- Rising inventory or A/R as % of assets = early warning
- Helps spot gradual deterioration before sudden announcements

**Above all**: True equity value remains elusive. Instead of striving for theoretical purity, use measure most useful to particular application. Exercise judgment to draw sound conclusions rather than retreating behind numbers derived by any one method.
