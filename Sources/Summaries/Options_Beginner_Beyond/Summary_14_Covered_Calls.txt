# Chapter 14: Covered Calls Playbook

## 1. Core Strategy

A Covered Call is executed by owning 100 shares of a stock and selling one out-of-the-money (OTM) call option against those shares. This is not a "conservative" strategy; its risk profile is nearly identical to selling a cash-secured or naked put.

### Key Objective
The primary goal is to generate income (from the call premium) on a stock you already own. This income reduces your cost basis in the stock. The trade-off is that you cap the potential upside of the stock at the strike price of the call you sell.

## 2. Walkthrough: Ideal vs. Reality

### The "Ideal" (But Unrealistic) Scenario
- **Setup:** Buy 100 shares of XYZ at $30.
- **Action:** Sell a call 10-15% OTM for a $1.20 premium ($120).
- **Outcome:** Over 7 months, the stock rises to $50. Each month, the call expires worthless, and you re-sell another.
- **Result:**
    - Stock Profit: $2,000 ($50 - $30)
    - Option Profit: $840 ($120 x 7)
    - Total Profit: $2,840 (a 95% return on the initial $3,000 investment).
- **Author's Critique:** This scenario is rare because it requires the stock to rise steadily without ever breaching the short call's strike price at expiration.

### The Realistic Scenario (QCOM Example)
This example illustrates the difficult decisions required in managing the trade.

- **May 2003:** Buy 100 QCOM @ $30. Sell 1 June $35 Call for $1.00.
    - **Max Profit:** $600 ([$35 strike - $30 cost] + $1 premium).
- **June Expiration:** QCOM is at $37.
    - **Decision Point:**
        1.  **Let it Go:** Allow the stock to be called away at $35 for a $600 profit (20% in one month).
        2.  **Keep the Stock:** Buy back the call for its current price of $2.00 (a $100 loss on the option) to hold the stock for more potential upside.
- **If You Keep the Stock:** You've now paid $100 to continue holding it. You then sell a July $40 Call for $2.00.
- **July Expiration:** QCOM falls back to $35. The July $40 call expires worthless.
    - **Decision Point:** The stock has fallen.
        1.  Sell an August $40 Call for a very low premium (e.g., $0.35).
        2.  Sell an August $35 Call for a higher premium (e.g., $2.00) but cap your upside at the current price.

**Conclusion:** Real-world covered call management involves continuous, tough decisions as the stock price moves.

## 3. Risk Profile: Covered Call vs. Naked Put

The author demonstrates that the risk/reward profile of a covered call is identical to that of a naked put.

| **Metric** | **Covered Call** | **Naked Put** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Setup** | Buy 100 QCOM @ $53, Sell Feb $55 Call @ $2 | Sell Feb $55 Put @ $4 |
| **Effective Cost** | $51 ($53 stock price - $2 premium) | $51 ($55 strike - $4 premium) |
| **Max Risk** | $5,100 (if stock goes to zero) | $5,100 (if stock goes to zero) |
| **Profit if QCOM > $55**| $400 ($55 sale price - $51 cost basis) | $400 ($4 premium kept) |
| **Loss if QCOM @ $45** | -$600 ($51 cost basis - $45 stock value) | -$600 ($51 cost basis - $45 stock value) |

- **Advantage of Covered Call:** You receive any dividends paid by the stock.
- **Advantage of Naked Put:** Ties up less capital, offering better leverage. However, this carries margin call risk if the stock drops sharply.

## 4. Actionable Trade Management Rules

1.  **Manage the Stock, Not the Option:** Your primary risk is the stock. Set a stop-loss price for your **stock holding**. If it's hit, sell the stock and buy back the short call simultaneously. Do not hold a declining stock just to eke out a small profit on the option.
2.  **Select a Strike You Mean:** Only sell a call at a strike price where you would be genuinely happy to sell your stock.
    - **To Keep Stock:** If your main goal is long-term holding, sell calls at a **higher strike price** (further OTM) for a smaller premium.
    - **To Generate Income:** If you are willing to part with the stock for a good profit, sell calls at a **closer strike price** to collect a larger premium.
3.  **Stay Near-Term:** Avoid selling long-dated calls (more than 2 months out). Stick to the front-month or second-month options (4-8 weeks). This gives you the flexibility to adjust to significant price moves.
4.  **Don't Be Greedy:** If the stock is above your strike at expiration, let it be called away. You made your profit. Resista the urge to buy the call back for a loss to chase further gains. This can lead to a "double loss": a loss on the option followed by a loss on the stock if it subsequently falls.
