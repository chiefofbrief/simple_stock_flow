# Chapter 18: Collars Playbook

The collar is a long-term strategy for conservative investors who want to hold a stock while strictly limiting downside risk. It is ideal for capital preservation while still allowing for modest, defined gains.

## 1. Core Strategy: The LEAPS Collar

A collar is constructed by "collaring" a stock position with two long-term options (LEAPS), which are required for this strategy. The holding period is typically 10-12 months or longer.

-   **Structure (for every 100 shares):**
    1.  **Own 100 Shares of the Stock.**
    2.  **Buy a Protective LEAPS Put:** This sets the minimum price (the "floor") at which you can sell your stock.
    3.  **Sell a LEAPS Call:** This generates premium to help pay for the put, but it also sets the maximum price (the "ceiling") at which your stock could be sold.

The trade is designed to be held until the options expire to achieve the calculated return.

## 2. Walkthrough: Risk vs. Reward Scenarios

The key to understanding collars is to see how adjusting the option strike prices changes the risk/reward profile of the trade. All examples assume buying 100 shares of XYZ at **$19/share** with a **14-month** time horizon.

### Scenario 1: The Standard Collar (Balanced Profile)

This provides a good balance between strong protection and a reasonable return.

-   **Trade Setup:**
    -   Buy 100 XYZ @ $19.00 (Cost: $1,900)
    -   Buy 1 Jan '06 **$20 Put** @ $2.90
    -   Sell 1 Jan '06 **$25 Call** @ $1.00
-   **Cost Analysis:**
    -   Net Option Cost: $1.90/share ($2.90 paid - $1.00 received).
    -   **Total Investment:** **$2,090** ($1,900 for stock + $190 for options).
-   **Payoff at Expiration:**
    -   **Max Loss (if stock is below $20):** Your stock is sold at $20 via the put for $2,000. Your net loss is **$90** ($2,090 cost - $2,000 sale value), or **-4.3%**.
    -   **Max Gain (if stock is above $25):** Your stock is called away at $25 for $2,500. Your net profit is **$410** ($2,500 sale value - $2,090 cost), or **+20%** (17% annualized).

### Scenario 2: The Zero-Risk Collar (Maximum Protection)

This structure is designed to eliminate any risk to the initial principal.

-   **Trade Setup:**
    -   Buy 100 XYZ @ $19.00
    -   Buy 1 Jan '06 **$22.50 Put** @ $4.50 (a more expensive, more protective put)
    -   Sell 1 Jan '06 **$25 Call** @ $1.00
-   **Cost Analysis:**
    -   Net Option Cost: $3.50/share.
    -   **Total Investment:** **$2,250**.
-   **Payoff at Expiration:**
    -   **Max Loss (if stock is below $22.50):** Your stock is sold at $22.50 via the put for $2,250. Your net loss is **$0**, achieving full capital preservation.
    -   **Max Gain (if stock is above $25):** Your stock is called away at $25 for $2,500. Your net profit is **$250**, or **+11%** (9.5% annualized).
-   **Trade-Off:** You sacrifice significant upside potential to achieve zero risk.

### Scenario 3: The Loose Collar (Enhanced Return)

This structure widens the collar to allow for more profit, but this comes with higher risk.

-   **Trade Setup:**
    -   Buy 100 XYZ @ $19.00
    -   Buy 1 Jan '06 **$20 Put** @ $2.90
    -   Sell 1 Jan '06 **$30 Call** @ $0.60 (a higher strike call brings in less premium)
-   **Cost Analysis:**
    -   Net Option Cost: $2.30/share.
    -   **Total Investment:** **$2,130**.
-   **Payoff at Expiration:**
    -   **Max Loss (if stock is below $20):** Your stock is sold at $20 for $2,000. Your net loss is **$130**, or **-6.1%**.
    -   **Max Gain (if stock is above $30):** Your stock is called away at $30 for $3,000. Your net profit is **$870**, or **+41%** (35% annualized).
-   **Trade-Off:** Increasing the profit potential directly increases the maximum potential loss.

## 3. Key Implementation Details & Enhancements

-   **Dividends are a Bonus:** Any dividends received during the holding period are kept by you. They directly increase your total return and reduce your max loss. In Scenario 1, a $0.65 dividend would have turned the -4.3% max loss into a negligible -0.3%.
-   **Longer Duration:** Using a 2-year LEAPS cycle instead of a 1-year cycle can often create a nearly riskless trade with a higher absolute profit, but the *annualized* return will be lower. The main drawback is having capital tied up for so long with a capped upside.
-   **Volatility is a Negative:** Collars are less effective on highly volatile stocks. High IV makes the protective puts very expensive, which increases the overall cost and maximum loss of the trade.
-   **Hold to Expiration:** The strategy is designed to be held to expiration. Exiting early will almost always result in a return that is lower than the calculated maximum profit.
