## Stock & Markets Analysis

### 1. Market & Macro Overview

A week defined by **AI disruption fears colliding with cooling inflation**. The CPI print came in softer than expected at 2.4% annually (r/stocks #5), which should have been fuel for a risk-on rally — yet stocks finished the week down 1.2%+ across all three major indexes (WSJ #3). This is a significant divergence: Goldilocks data failing to lift equities signals that something else is driving the bus.

**Indicators:**
- **Inflation:** CPI cooled to 2.4% YoY in January, below expectations (r/stocks #5). Treasury yields declined in response (WSJ #10). The Fed's preferred gauge (PCE) is due next week on a shortened trading week (markets closed Monday per r/options #1).
- **Dollar:** The WSJ Dollar Index fell for a sixth consecutive session, down 0.95% on the week to 94.15 (WSJ #18). Persistent dollar weakness alongside cooling inflation and cautious equity flows suggests foreign capital rotation, not just rate repricing.
- **Gold/Commodities:** Gold settled up 2% Friday, silver up 3.1%, both positive for the week (WSJ #17). Oil settled the week lower (WSJ #16). Natural gas lower for the week on mild winter outlook (WSJ #15). The gold bid alongside equity weakness and dollar decline fits a defensive/uncertainty posture, not a growth scare.
- **Crypto:** Bitcoin-linked products (IBIT +5.18%, BITO +5.09%) rallied on the day but the broader narrative is "falling back to earth" (Barron's #50). Stablecoin health flagged as a key indicator (WSJ #7).

**Sentiment:** The market is in a **selective risk-off mode**. Investors aren't selling everything — they're repricing specific sectors (software, ad-dependent, AI narrative plays) while rotating toward cash-generative, real-world businesses. Barron's captures this well: "Getting real was the thing that worked" (Barron's #25). The Dow briefly touched 50,000 but may mark an interim top (Barron's #6). Multiple Barron's articles frame this as an "AI-inspired meltdown" (Barron's #25) rather than a macro deterioration event. The divergence between soft inflation data and negative equity performance suggests the AI narrative correction is the dominant force.

---

### 2. AI Ecosystem Positioning (Sector-Specific)

This week's AI dynamics center on a critical narrative shift: **AI as threat to knowledge-economy moats, not just enabler of growth.** Several articles frame this as a structural reevaluation, not a temporary selloff.

**Applications & Software (Layer 8) — Under Fire:**
- The "vibe-coding" narrative is now explicitly named as a threat to enterprise software (Barron's #37 — "Vibe-Coding in Gas Town? A Guide to the Software Selloff with 4 Sexy Stock Picks"). This maps directly to the AI framework's "Software Disruption vs. Moat Durability" tension.
- Pinterest (-16.83%, Barron's #32, r/stocks #6) is exhibit A: Q1 guidance hit by large U.S. retailers scaling back ad spend due to tariff uncertainty. Barron's frames this as proving Meta's dominance — the ad market isn't shrinking, it's consolidating to the strongest platform. **This is a Layer 8 revenue test failure**: PINS can't generate enough value for advertisers relative to META.
- DraftKings (-13.51%) appeared on both losers and most-actives lists — another application-layer company under pressure.
- Wealth management stocks slammed by AI fears (Barron's #19) — the disruption narrative is spreading beyond software into financial services.

**Applications & Software — The Counter-Narrative:**
- Morningstar argues investors are "worrying too much about AI disruption" of software stocks (r/ValueInvesting #9). The counter: switching costs, network effects, deep integrations. This is precisely the moat durability debate outlined in the AI framework.
- Barron's #37 identifies 4 software "picks" — worth tracking whether analyst consensus is forming around specific survivors.

**Infrastructure & Power (Layer 3):**
- Fastly (FSLY) +13.84% on the most actives list — an edge/CDN infrastructure play moving counter to the broader software selloff. Worth noting whether this reflects infrastructure resilience or a one-off catalyst.

**Compute & Chips (Layers 1-2):**
- NVDA -2.21% on the day, appearing on most actives. Leveraged semiconductor ETFs (SOXS, SOXL) showing active positioning. Earnings predictions thread active on Reddit (r/stocks #9).
- The freight broker selloff triggered by "a former karaoke company" (Barron's #47) — wall street defended freight brokers after AI disruption fears. This is the reflexive pattern spreading to non-tech sectors.

**The Big Picture:** Barron's #21 ("How AI Is Undermining American Exceptionalism in U.S. Markets") frames a provocative thesis: AI was supposed to entrench U.S. knowledge-economy dominance, but investors are now questioning whether knowledge itself is losing value. This connects to the broader "Hedge America" trade (WSJ #13) where the dollar's slide and slowing foreign Treasury purchases are warning signs. If AI commoditizes knowledge work, the premium investors pay for U.S. "knowledge economy" stocks may compress — a structural repricing, not a cyclical dip.

---

### 3. Applied Investment Flags (General)

**Narrative vs. Reality:**
- **"AI Meltdown" framing may be overstated.** Multiple Barron's articles use dramatic language (Barron's #22, #25), but the actual index moves are modest (SPY +0.07% on Friday, week down ~1.2%). The real action is stock-specific dispersion, not a broad panic. Barron's #23 ("Why Stocks Are Making Gigantic Moves All Over the Place") attributes this to many industries undergoing structural changes simultaneously — this is a rotation/repricing event, not a systemic risk event.
- **Soft CPI not rallying stocks is meaningful** (Barron's #22). The two-hazards-of-forecasting principle applies: even correct macro forecasts provide no edge if the market is focused on a different variable (in this case, AI disruption). The inflation trade is temporarily subordinate to the AI repricing trade.
- **Cash is king narrative emerging.** Barron's #29 (Exxon, Walmart, and 9 others soaring "because cash is king again") signals a rotation toward businesses with tangible cash generation vs. narrative-driven growth. This aligns with the Guidelines' emphasis on economic reality over GAAP presentation.

**Edge Opportunities:**
- **PINS at -16.83%** — Market narrative: Meta dominance kills second-tier ad platforms. But the actual catalyst is retailers cutting ad spend on tariff uncertainty (Barron's #32). These are potentially different theses: (1) structural share loss to META vs. (2) temporary macro headwind on ad budgets. If it's the latter, this could be a mispricing per the Opportunity Sources principle (quality business + solvable temporary problem).
- **Carvana (CVNA) fraud allegations** (r/stocks #3, 278 upvotes, 188 comments) — A 14-year automotive industry veteran alleges CVNA artificially inflated earnings by "funneling bad loans onto affiliate business." If substantiated, this maps directly to the revenue manipulation / snowballing dynamic red flags in the Guidelines. The stock was mentioned in r/options #12 (Flow & Technical) as "75% Bullish" — sentiment divergence from the fraud thesis is notable.
- **Big Tech as "the next GE"** (WSJ #42, Barron's #42) — The conglomerate discount analogy is provocative. The Guidelines specifically reference the conglomerate boom as a historical reflexive episode where investors valued per-share earnings identically regardless of source. If market participants begin applying conglomerate discounts to hyperscalers, it could trigger a repricing of the entire AI infrastructure stack.
- **AppLovin (APP) stabilizing** (Barron's #40) — Capitalwatch dropping its fraud investigation is a de-risking event. Per the Opportunity Sources principle, if the business quality is intact and the fraud narrative was the primary depressant, the stock may be mispriced.
- **Sphere Entertainment (SPHR) +22%** (Barron's #10) after strong Q4 results — a "real world" business outperforming in an environment where real-world earnings are being rewarded over AI narrative. Worth monitoring as a sentiment barometer.

**Reddit Signal Check:**
- r/stocks #1 (3,769 upvotes): Wall Street doubts U.S. jobs numbers are "implausible." If employment data credibility is eroding, this introduces a macro uncertainty layer that the soft CPI alone cannot resolve.
- r/ValueInvesting #6: PayPal at trailing P/E of 7.36 — extremely depressed for a still-profitable, revenue-growing business. The Guidelines' "low-quality at low prices" test is relevant: is this speculative due to doubtful quality, or has pessimism created a genuine margin of safety?
- r/ValueInvesting #7: Schwab (SCHW) down 10%+ in a week despite 22% revenue growth and 50% EPS growth YoY — another "narrative vs. reality" candidate where price action diverges from fundamentals.

### 4. Screening Candidates

**1. PINS — Pinterest, Inc.**
- **The Signal:** Barron's #32, r/stocks #6, Losers table (-16.83%), Most Actives list
- **What News Says:** Q1 revenue guidance missed due to large U.S. retailers pulling back ad spend on tariff-induced uncertainty. Company cut ~15% of workforce last month. Barron's frames this as further proof of Meta's dominance in digital advertising — PINS is losing share to the strongest platform.
- **The Why:** -16.83% single-day drop on an ad platform with 2B+ monthly visits creates a potential mispricing candidate. The question is whether this is permanent structural share loss (META wins) or temporary macro headwind (tariff uncertainty → retailer ad budget cuts). The Guidelines' Opportunity Sources principle: high-quality brand-name business + large but potentially solvable problem.
- **Investigation Items:**
  - Financial statements: Revenue concentration by advertiser segment — how dependent is PINS on large retail advertisers vs. diversified SMB?
  - Financial statements: Margin trajectory and cash generation pre- and post-workforce reduction
  - Research: PINS user engagement trends — is the platform losing relevance, or is this purely an advertiser demand issue?
  - External: Tariff timeline and retailer ad budget recovery patterns from prior tariff cycles
- **Data Gap:** PINS actual Q4 earnings details (revenue, margins, user metrics) vs. the Q1 guidance that triggered the selloff.

**2. CVNA — Carvana Co.**
- **The Signal:** r/stocks #3 (278 upvotes, 188 comments), r/options #12 (75% Bullish flow)
- **What News Says:** A 14-year automotive industry veteran alleges Carvana has artificially inflated earnings by funneling bad loans onto an affiliate business. The post details a structured pattern of loan quality manipulation.
- **The Why:** The Guidelines explicitly flag revenue manipulation and the "snowballing dynamic" as critical red flags. The divergence between bearish fundamental allegations (fraud) and bullish options flow (75% bullish per r/options #12) is exactly the kind of narrative-vs-reality gap worth investigating. If the fraud thesis has merit, the bullish positioning creates asymmetric downside risk.
- **Investigation Items:**
  - Financial statements: Loan origination volumes, gain-on-sale margins, and affiliate entity transactions
  - Financial statements: Cash flow vs. reported earnings divergence (the snowballing test)
  - Research: SEC filings — related party transactions, off-balance-sheet vehicles
  - External: DriveTime (affiliate entity) financial health and loan performance data
- **Data Gap:** CVNA's actual loan loss provisions vs. industry benchmarks, and the financial structure of the affiliate loan arrangement.

**3. Software Selloff Basket — "Vibe-Coding" Disruption Theme**
- **The Signal:** Barron's #37, Barron's #21, Barron's #22, Barron's #25, r/ValueInvesting #2, r/ValueInvesting #9
- **What News Says:** Enterprise software stocks are being repriced on fears that AI tools (including "vibe-coding") can replicate or replace incumbent products. The selloff has extended to credit markets, affecting refinancing ability. Barron's identifies 4 specific picks as survivors. Morningstar argues disruption fears are overblown for companies with strong competitive advantages.
- **The Why:** The AI framework identifies this as the core Layer 8 tension: "Software Disruption vs. Moat Durability." The selloff is creating potential mispricings in high-quality software companies if the disruption narrative is overestimated relative to actual switching costs. The freight broker selloff (Barron's #47) shows the narrative is spreading to non-software sectors, suggesting possible contagion overshooting.
- **Investigation Items:**
  - Financial statements: Net revenue retention rates, switching cost proxies (contract length, integration depth) for specific software names
  - Research: Actual "vibe-coding" adoption data vs. narrative — is there measurable displacement of enterprise software?
  - External: Credit spreads on software company debt — are credit markets confirming or diverging from equity market fears?
- **Data Gap:** Specific tickers in Barron's #37's "4 sexy stock picks" — need to identify which software names are being flagged as survivors. The article titles and summaries in the digest don't list them.

**4. BFAM — Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc.**
- **The Signal:** Losers table (-18.25%)
- **What News Says:** No specific news coverage in the digest — the stock simply appears on the biggest losers list with an 18%+ single-day decline.
- **The Why:** An 18%+ drop in a $4B+ market cap childcare/education services company without prominent news coverage in the digest suggests an earnings miss or guidance cut. This is a real-world services business — not an AI narrative play — making the selloff worth investigating as a potential Opportunity Sources candidate (brand-name business + possible one-time disappointment).
- **Investigation Items:**
  - External: What triggered the drop — earnings miss, guidance cut, or other catalyst?
  - Financial statements: Revenue and margin trends, employer-sponsored childcare demand trajectory
  - Research: Competitive dynamics in employer childcare services
- **Data Gap:** The specific catalyst for the -18.25% move is not in the digest data.

**5. PYPL — PayPal Holdings, Inc.**
- **The Signal:** r/ValueInvesting #6 (17 upvotes, 69 comments)
- **What News Says:** Trailing P/E of 7.36, forward P/E 7.3-7.6. Business is still profitable with consistent (if slow) revenue growth. Reddit poster notes it's been a frequent topic — sentiment is polarized.
- **The Why:** A trailing P/E of 7.36 for a profitable, revenue-growing payments business is extreme. The Guidelines' Investment vs. Speculation framework asks: is this "low-quality at low prices" (speculative due to doubtful quality) or has pessimism created genuine margin of safety? At these multiples, even modest improvements in perception could drive significant upside. Already on SESSION_NOTES tracking — warrants updated screening.
- **Investigation Items:**
  - Financial statements: Transaction margin trends, take rate trajectory, and Braintree vs. branded checkout mix
  - Financial statements: Cash flow generation and capital return (buybacks at these multiples are highly accretive)
  - Research: Competitive positioning vs. Stripe, Adyen, Apple Pay — is the moat eroding or just the narrative?
- **Data Gap:** Updated Q4 2025 earnings data (if reported) to confirm whether revenue growth is stabilizing or decelerating.

# 🌍 A week of espionage

Plus: Meme of the day

Feb 13, 2026

**Today’s briefing:**  
— A week of espionage  
— New dictator just dropped  
— Meme of the day

**Good morning {{first_name | Intriguer}}**. You know that Norman Rockwell painting meme where a regular guy stands up at a town meeting to voice his presumably unpopular opinion? This morning, I’m him: “ _the Winter Olympics are better than the Summer Olympics_ ”. Cue outraged murmuring among the townsfolk.

I like to imagine a casual conversation at the annual Olympian Christmas party: Oh you do the long jump? Me too! Except 100m through the air on very long, wobbly planks. You’re a crack shot at 50m? Oh what a coincidence, me too! Right in the middle of running a marathon on very skinny, wobbly planks.

And then there’s the skeleton, which... look, I don’t want to be grim, but if you’ve recently gotten some bad news from the doctor and are looking to go out on your own spectacular terms...

To top it all off, every single TV shot is framed by the spectacular Italian Alps. Motion unanimously passed, I think you’ll agree.

Now, with that out of the way, let’s get on to the fun stuff: a classic Friday Intrigue story involving communist **spies** , stolen NATO **secrets** , and a **CIA** tip-off.

### Name of the day

**Tarique Rahman**

That’s the likely next prime minister of Bangladesh (pop. 175m), after his centre-right party won a majority in yesterday’s elections. He’s no stranger to power: his mother was the country’s first female prime minister, and his father was assassinated while serving as president in 1981.

### **The spies among us.**

There’ve always been spies among us. That college friend who says they work at State but never posted their Flag Day snaps to LinkedIn? Suspicious. Or the neighbour who’s _really_ curious __ about what you do in that embassy all day? Interesting. 

Whether it’s King Zimri-Lin’s vast Mesopotamia spying network 3,800 years ago, or ✌️consultants✌️ pinging us on LinkedIn with too-good-to-be-true jobs today, espionage always makes for blockbuster material, and it’s been a busy week, starting with…

  1. **How they recruit**




The classic framework for why folks turn is ‘**MICE** ’: money, ideology, coercion, and/or ego.

For a **money** example, look no further than Germany, where it turns out the Kremlin only had to pay a few useful idiots €100 per vehicle to blow up 270+ exhaust pipes and make it look like the work of a hawkish party Moscow didn’t like, all while polarising Germany.

For **ideology** (with a bit of money and ego), look at what **the CIA** just did this week, dropping its latest Mandarin-language [YouTube video](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mCVjyXI-jM>) titled _“Save the Future”._

Aimed at disillusioned officers in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) amid President Xi’s [sweeping purges](<https://archives.internationalintrigue.io/p/reduced-size-template-60b5b5c5582f56a1?utm_source=archives.internationalintrigue.io&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=where-s-zhang-youxia&_bhlid=b0a151d197e236d5edc96cb57f4342127105009b&last_resource_guid=Post%3Ad142ac52-06f6-4f52-9bac-31ca301ee89c&jwt_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWJzY3JpYmVyX2lkIjoiMDcxNTVkODEtNjAyMS00MTZiLWE2OGEtMTA4ZDkxYzJkZTc0IiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiI4NzFhY2M4NS1jMjlkLTRiODMtYWI4OS05ODQwNWQyMjdmMGUiLCJhY2Nlc3NfdHlwZSI6InJlYWQtb25seSIsImV4cCI6MTc2OTY4MzY4OCwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHAuYmVlaGlpdi5jb20iLCJpYXQiOjE3Njk0MjQ0ODh9.C_xPoVrDQLJ5tG-BFN7f_69PWRNrhFfnwKSwhd3oEBc>), it frames cooperation with the CIA not as a betrayal, but a way to "_take control of your own destiny_ " and protect your family from a corrupt system.

The curious thing about this campaign is how it’s almost **the inverse** of the CIA’s earlier big PLA drive when it plied ambitious officers with cash to help bribe their way up — rather than hunker down from — a corrupt system.

**Will it work this time?** CIA boss John Ratcliffe argued similar ads worked last year, but he’s going to declare success either way: the mere existence of an ad and victory lap is already enough to pour gasoline on Xi’s flaming paranoia, helping rattle China’s elites.

But while you can see how Xi’s aggressive purges might leave insiders more open to a CIA off-ramp, you can also see how the CIA’s last China ending (CIA sources getting rounded up and shot) would leave any insider locked shut. And yet… if you’re worried your own paranoid boss might purge you anyway, maybe you take another look at that off-ramp?

  2. **What they want**




[Estonia](<https://raport.valisluureamet.ee/2026/en/>) just dropped its **annual intelligence report** , offering a perfect example of how spooks prioritise: it dedicates _five of its seven_ chapters to Russia! And that makes sense when you recall Russia has attacked Estonia multiple times.

It also explains why Estonia’s intel has long had **cult followings** across the West: eg, Estonia’s legendary Russia analyst (and current ambassador to Israel) Andres Vosman just went viral with insights on the Kremlin, whether obsessively monitoring its own people, dreading the fallout from returning veterans, or deepening its own dependence on China.

The Estonian report also highlights that, yes, **friends spy on friends!** It gives the example of **North Korean** operatives actively gathering info across Russia and China, the regime’s closest (only?) partners. Why? The target cities (China’s Dalian and Shenyang, Russia’s Blagoveshchensk) are just over the border, suggesting a focus on:

  * **a**) managing and exploiting DPRK’s own worker diaspora, and

  * **b**) stealing nearby defence tech (the DPRK has science & tech ✌️attachés✌️ there).




Btw, speaking of stealing defence tech, Google just released [a grim report](<https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/threats-to-defense-industrial-base>) on how state-backed hackers are now targeting employees right across Western defence supply chains.

  3. **When they get caught**




As of this week, a 54-year-old squadron leader in the Greek air force is now in detention for allegedly **leaking NATO secrets to China**. Seems his handlers first pinged him on LinkedIn with a consulting opportunity, then met him in-person near a NATO summit.

The military bigwig then made an undeclared trip to China in 2024, where Beijing’s MSS seems to have sprung the trap — maybe of **the honey variety** , though it could just as easily be the mere threat of publishing pics of him secretly meeting MSS operatives.

Either way, he allegedly caved, did some training on how to send classified docs via an **encrypted device** , and started earning €5,000–15,000 per leak via a debit card linked to a Hong Kong-based payments provider. Greek intelligence seemingly got a CIA tip-off, and has made a surprising amount of detail public here, as has Paris this week in charging…

  * four guys for using a satellite dish at an **Airbnb** to intercept secrets for China, and

  * another for wearing **video-recording glasses** on a fighter jet assembly line in Cergy!




There’s sometimes leverage in managing these cases quietly, but all the publicity here suggests Western capitals are signalling for **a**) locals not to be stupid, and **b**) rivals to know there’ll be increasingly steep costs ahead.

#### Intrigue’s Take

We’ve barely scratched the surface of a single week here, dear Intriguer. We could’ve added Australian intelligence recruiting a foreign imam to infiltrate extremists in Sydney, or the Turks arresting two alleged spies for Israel, or the American who just got three years for trying to leak info to China from a base in Germany, or even the Canberra bakery assistant facing charges she was helping China’s communist party track a local diaspora.

But the point is it’s everywhere. And former French intel operative ‘Jack Beaumont’ once described to us what it’s like to have your eyes opened to that fact: it’s like how after going scuba diving for the first time, **you can never un-see** what’s beneath the waves.

Anyway, it’s only going to get more pervasive as our world gets more spooked. And while we all tell ourselves we’d never betray our country, anyone working in a sensitive area should remember there are entire teams out there with legit tech, tradecraft, and tenacity, whose literal only job is to test that assumption in every possible way.

### Meanwhile, elsewhere…

🇯🇵**JAPAN — Stop right there.**  
Japan’s fisheries agency has seized a China-based fishing vessel after it refused inspection and attempted to flee, with the 11 onboard now facing potential charges back in Nagasaki port. ([_NBC_](<https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/japan-seizes-chinese-fishing-boat-arrests-skipper-rcna258882>) _)_

**_Comment:_**_This one’s significant not so much for the location (absolutely within Japan’s EEZ), but the timing, coming just days after hawkish Sanae Takaichi won her historic (re)election: Beijing may well see it as Takaichi’s first move._

🇰🇵**NORTH KOREA — Nepo baby.**  
South Korean intelligence has told lawmakers the 13-year-old daughter of the North’s dictator (Kim) has now advanced to “ _successor-designate_ ” stage from her earlier “ _successor training_ ” status. (_[The Chosun Daily](<https://www.chosun.com/english/national-en/2026/02/12/PQAMWDKJPFCXDHDHGELH6LKLNQ/>)_ _)_

**_Comment:_**_We’ll soon get a sense how accurate this assessment is, because the North’s five-yearly Workers’ Party congress is scheduled for later this month — the young girl’s attendance, seating, and/or official mentions will all offer clues. Btw, the world first learned of her existence (and possible name) thanks to *that* visit by NBA star Dennis Rodman in 2013, when he reported holding her as a baby._

🇩🇪**GERMANY — Crucial conference.**  
The influential Munich Security Conference kicks off today (Friday), attracting ~record world leader attendance amid cascading crises. ([_Politico_](<https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/gop-munich-security-conference-shutdown-00779083>) _)_

**_Comment:_**_There’s speculation Marco Rubio might seek to stabilise transatlantic ties in his address tomorrow (Saturday) after last year’s JD Vance speech. But any hoped reassurance might now be undercut by the fact DC’s budget showdown means the biggest-ever congressional delegation to Munich is now cancelled (though some members will still attend on their own)._

🇺🇦 **UKRAINE — Olympic level drama.**  
President Zelensky has blasted the Olympic Committee as “ _playing into the hands of aggressors_ ” after it banned a Ukrainian athlete over a helmet depicting some of the ~600 athletes and coaches killed by Putin’s attacks. ([France24](<https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20260212-zelensky-blasts-olympics-ban-for-ukrainian-athlete-over-memorial-helmet>))

**Comment** : _When the stakes are existential (as for Ukraine), the apolitical quickly looks political. We_ _[explored](<https://archives.internationalintrigue.io/p/the-geopolitics-of-the-winter-games>)_ _the geopolitics of the Winter Games last week._

🇰🇪 **KENYA** **— Let’s try this again.**  
President Ruto has announced Kenya will reopen its border with Somalia in April, almost 15 years after al-Shabab terrorist attacks forced its closure. ([BBC](<https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70k4yw049yo>))

**Comment** : _It’s a good sign, though less so when you consider this announcement has been delayed multiple times over the years due to insecurity, and Ruto is now having to accompany the move with a big troop deployment. We_ _[explored](<https://archives.internationalintrigue.io/p/reduced-size-template-35d4b9aa64699882>)_ _some of the security challenges facing the Horn of Africa on Wednesday._

🇲🇽**MEXICO — To the rescue.**  
Two Mexican naval ships have docked in Cuba with ~536 tonnes of food and other humanitarian aid, a couple of weeks after President Trump threatened tariffs on anyone supplying the Cubans with oil. ([AP](<https://apnews.com/article/mexico-cuba-humanitarian-aid-havana-us-sanctions-52c44db94c9423511d67366662e78ac4>))

**Comment** : _We_ _[explored](<https://archives.internationalintrigue.io/p/is-cuba-next>)_ _the Cuba situation earlier this week. Since then, Air Canada has suspended flights due to the local fuel shortage, further straining Cuba’s critical tourism sector. It’s unclear where this lands, but there’s a growing sense something will break._

🇸🇦**SAUDI ARABIA — New kid in town.**  
The kingdom has appointed a new investment minister (Saif), quietly putting the old guy out to pasture as the crown prince’s big Vision 2030 hits turbulence. The new minister was previously an exec at Riyadh’s $925B _Public Investment Fund._ ([Al-Monitor](<https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/saudi-arabia-names-new-investment-minister-vision-2030-funding-lags>))

**Comment** : _It’s a tricky bind for the Saudis, who are already running a deficit (impressive for the world’s ~largest oil exporter), but realistically need to keep spending if they want to diversify away from oil and hit their ambitious $100B annual FDI target by 2030._

###  Meme of the day

No offence to the many good ones, but oh lordie, find yourself serving under a bad political ambassador and you’ll soon be arriving at meetings like rapper 21 Savage arrived at the Super Bowl: absolutely hugging that wall to maximise your distance from the fallout as your happy but hapless envoy mangles greetings, offends locals, then aggressively brings up the one thing your notes begged the ambassador not to raise.
