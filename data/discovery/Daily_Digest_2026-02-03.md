## Stock & Markets Analysis

### 1. Market & Macro Overview
* **Indicators:** A massive divergence in asset classes. Gold (+6.1%) and Silver (+8.2%) posted their largest gains since 2009 (WSJ #26), signaling a potential flight to safety or inflation hedge, while Treasury yields remained flat (WSJ #14). Oil edged higher on a US-India trade deal (WSJ #25). The US government shutdown appears poised to end (Barron's #44).
* **Sentiment:** The market is exhibiting a "Cautionary Posture" mixed with "Panic" in specific sectors. A fear of AI displacement triggered a sharp selloff in software and data stocks (WSJ #1), dragging the Nasdaq down 1.4%. The reaction to Anthropic’s new tools suggests the market is moving from "blind boom" to "survivor selection."

### 2. AI Ecosystem Positioning (Sector-Specific)
* **The Reflexive Loop:** The loop is showing volatility. While capital continues to pour in (SpaceX buying xAI for a potential $1T combined valuation - Intrigue), the *value destruction* side of the loop is hitting the Application layer hard. The fear is no longer just about who wins, but who gets wiped out by the "Big 5" (WSJ #2).
* **Compute & Infrastructure:** Hardware remains the perceived safe haven, though not immune to volatility. AMD beat earnings but fell (r/stocks #5), suggesting the "Execution Year" bar is incredibly high. Nvidia held steady (r/stocks #7).
* **Models & Tools:** Consolidating rapidly. The SpaceX/xAI news (Intrigue) reinforces the "Big 5" (or in this case, a new Titan) thesis, creating a closed ecosystem of compute (SpaceX/Tesla?) and model (xAI).
* **Applications:** The "Kill Zone" is expanding. Stocks like LegalZoom (LZ), Gartner (IT), and Clarivate (CLVT) were crushed (~20% drops) on fears that Anthropic's Claude renders their data/service models obsolete (WSJ #1, Barron's #16). This is the "Revenue Imperative" facing an existential test.

### 3. Applied Investment Flags (General)
* **Economic Reality vs. GAAP:** **PayPal (PYPL)** missed earnings and is down ~20% (r/ValueInvesting #3). The "transaction margin dollars grew 3%" (r/stocks #3) contrasts with the stock being "cut in half." Investors must verify if this is a true decline in owner earnings or a temporary growth stall.
* **Mispricing vs. Impairment:** The **Software/SaaS Sector** selloff (Barron's #8) is the prime hunting ground. Is **Gartner (IT)** (-20%) permanently impaired by AI, or is the market overestimating the speed of displacement? This smells like a "permanent structural impairment" panic that might offer "solvable one-time problem" opportunities if the moat is real.
* **The Glamour Metrics Trap:** **Walmart (WMT)** hitting $1 Trillion (Barron's #40) prompted analysts to remove it from top lists. Be wary of paying for the "digital growth" narrative at peak multiples.
* **Reflexivity & Fertile Fallacies:** The **Gold/Silver** spike (WSJ #26) paired with the "Meme Stock" comparison (Barron's #19) suggests a reflexive bid independent of industrial fundamentals—momentum chasing is in play.

### 4. Screening Candidates

* **Ticker/Theme:** **Gartner (IT) / Clarivate (CLVT)**
* **The Signal:** Daily Digest Losers (IT -20.87%, CLVT -20.23%), WSJ #1.
* **What News Says:** "Fear Over New AI Tools Triggers Tech Selloff." Data providers are seen as victims of AI's ability to synthesize information cheaply.
* **The Why:** A 20% haircut in a single day for established data monopolies suggests panic. If their proprietary data is the "feed" for AI, they might have leverage, not obsolescence.
* **Investigation Items:**
  - Verify data licensing agreements (do LLMs pay them?).
  - Investigate "Data Gap" in their moat—can AI replicate their proprietary datasets?
* **Data Gap:** Customer retention rates post-AI rollout.

* **Ticker/Theme:** **PayPal (PYPL)**
* **The Signal:** r/ValueInvesting #3, Daily Digest Losers (-20.31%).
* **What News Says:** Missed top/bottom lines, guidance lowered. "Painpal" narrative is peak bearishness.
* **The Why:** Classic "Value Trap" vs. "Deep Value" setup. Trading at multi-year lows despite growing transaction margin dollars (r/stocks #3).
* **Investigation Items:**
  - Validate "Transaction Margin" growth vs. "Net Revenue" miss.
  - Check Free Cash Flow yield at this new price.
* **Data Gap:** Impact of Braintree/unbranded processing on margins (Economic Reality of the mix shift).

* **Ticker/Theme:** **Disney (DIS)**
* **The Signal:** Barron's #4, r/stocks #9.
* **What News Says:** Strong earnings (Parks record revenue), but stock down 5% on Iger succession news. Josh D'Amaro named CEO.
* **The Why:** The "Mispricing" flag—price moving on governance uncertainty despite operational success (Parks).
* **Investigation Items:**
  - Confirm Parks operating income margins (Economic Reality).
  - Assess D'Amaro's track record with the "Parks" cash cow.
* **Data Gap:** Streaming path to double-digit margins.

* **Ticker/Theme:** **Precious Metals (Gold/Silver)**
* **The Signal:** WSJ #26, WSJ #33.
* **What News Says:** Gold +6.1%, Silver +8.2%. "Largest Percentage Gain Since 2009."
* **The Why:** "Reflexivity" check. Is this a breakout confirming a new macro regime (inflation/war) or a "Head Fake" (Barron's #38)?
* **Investigation Items:**
  - Correlate with real yield moves.
  - Check ETF inflows (GLD/SLV) for retail participation signs.
* **Data Gap:** Central Bank buying data for the current month.

# 🌍 Will Trump hit Iran again?

Plus: China objected to this Grammy-winner

Feb 3, 2026

**Today’s briefing:**  
— Will Trump hit Iran again?  
— May the odds be ever in your favour  
— China objects to this Grammy-winner

**Good morning {{first_name | Intriguer}}**. For years Middle East watchers have speculated over how and when an Iran-US war might blow up into the biggest conflict in the region, drawing in proxy forces, regional heavyweights, and non-state actors. For those watching the latest episode of 2026 at home, we may very well be approaching this point soon.

Our top story brings you back to the Middle East and dives into **whether the US might make its next move on Iran**. Separately, odds aren't looking good for the UN, which recently pleaded for all countries to refrain from acts of war during the approaching Winter Olympics…

Let’s crack on.

### Mystery of the day

**What did Tulsi Gabbard (allegedly) do?**

The Wall Street Journal [says](<https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/classified-whistleblower-complaint-about-tulsi-gabbard-stalls-within-her-agency-027f5331>) there’s a whistleblower complaint against Trump’s spymaster that’s so sensitive, the administration has spent months figuring how to inform Congress.

### **The latest on Iran**

That’s the Strait of Hormuz chokepoint off Iran

The question on everyone’s lips is no longer when this northern winter might end — Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow on Groundhog Day yesterday, meaning six more weeks of winter, though given this guy’s poor record of accuracy, maybe it’s time we stopped taking meteorological insights from a rodent in Pennsylvania? 

Anyway, the question is now whether Trump will hit Iran again. So let’s break it down, starting with…

**Why Trump**** _might_****hit Iran…**

  1. **He’s done it before**




Trump’s appetite for force seems to grow with the eating. So, riding high after this year’s Maduro opp, last year’s Iran hits, and 2020’s Soleimani assassination, the president’s overriding thought could well be… **why not go again?** Which gets us to…

  2. **He’s ready to go again**




While reportedly first hitting pause given concerns (internal and allied) that the US wasn’t ready for any counterattack, there’s now a staggering amount of US firepower nearby.

The regime’s own praetorian guard (the IRGC) is running naval drills in the Hormuz chokepoint, but that **24-mile stretch** carrying a fifth of the world’s oil is now completely surrounded, whether by the USS Lincoln carrier group off the Gulf of Oman, the ~three combat ships off Bahrain, the ~four destroyers right near the Strait, the same F-15Es in Jordan that played a supporting role back in June, or the build-up on Diego Garcia.

  3. **He’s said he’ll go again**




Trump says lots of things, though he’s been notably verbose on Iran, whether telling protestors “ _help is on its way_ ”, warning the regime not to kill them because "_we are locked and loaded and ready to go_ ", or when the regime kept on killing them anyway, vowing it’ll “ _pay a very big price_ ” — he also flagged, “ _**it’s time to look for new leadership in Iran.**_ ”

Now, we’re not winning a Pulitzer when we point out that Trump doesn’t always do what he says, but doing nothing would be quite the backdown at this point.

  4. **The regime is weak**




We’ve long charted the stats, whether it’s the 50% rial collapse, 50% inflation, or crippling drought. But here’s another example: last year’s major bank collapse saw regime-insiders get bailouts so big, and the central bank print so much money to cover the shortfall, Tehran had to cut popular subsidies to make ends meet.

It was arguably this **spectacular mix of corruption and hardship** that ignited it all. And that’s before we get to, say, the Iranian air defences now offline due to US-Israeli hits. So Trump might feel it’s his chance to topple this old US foe once and for all. Then finally…

  5. **Oil prices are low**




He’s also famously market-sensitive and oil-boosterish, so with crude now trading in the low 60s, Trump has a decent cushion to absorb any market jitters, which leads us to…

**Why Trump might**** _not_****hit Iran…**

  1. **US-China trade talks**




The one country buying most of Iran’s sanctioned oil is also the one with a record of hitting back so hard, it nearly broke the world’s deepest market (US Treasuries). We’re talking, of course, about China, which gets up to **~15% of its oil from Iran** (plus ~4% from Venezuela). Together, that’s enough leverage to be a problem for China, right as Trump is gunning for a big trade deal to crown his planned April visit to Beijing.

That kind of leverage could place this point in either the _for_ or _against_ column, but we’ll drop it in the _against_ for now __ given how much Trump seems to prioritise a big China deal.

  2. **Allied jitters**




While several regional partners quietly (or loudly in Israel’s case) welcome a weaker Iran, they’re also **actively distancing themselves** from any role in US planning. It’s partly for domestic optics, partly to avoid Iranian retaliation, and partly (for immediate neighbours like Turkey) to avoid border spill-over. For the Emiratis, Saudis, and Qataris, there’s also an awareness that this constant conflict is just bad for their grand hub visions.

Meanwhile, US allies in Europe don’t exactly seem top of Trump’s mind lately, but they’re mostly also pushing for a return to diplomacy. Still, it’s possible all this allied unease just shapes Trump’s tactics (go solo) rather than appetite. And finally…

  3. **Post-hit uncertainty**




In explaining his approach to Maduro, Trump recently drew an interesting comparison to the disastrous fallout from the US invasion of Iraq — ie, sometimes the chaos after a hit is worse than any problem you thought a hit might solve.

**So… will he do it?**

There’s now word Trump’s envoy (Witkoff) is headed to Istanbul for Iran talks this Friday, though Trump pulled a similar fake-out before last year’s hits. Plus throw in the rough headlines back home (Epstein, ICE, shutdown), and you can _imagine_ a scenario in which (say) Trump decides to shape Friday’s talks by approving limited, targeted hits in parallel.

#### Intrigue’s Take

While the _will-he-won’t-he_ question is a guessing game, it does open two big debates.

First is the _**FAFO vs TACO**_ __ debate to decipher whether a particular decision falls into the _F*@k Around & Find Out_, or _Trump Always Chickens Out_ category. It’s hardly science but there are some guardrails to consider: TACO seems more likely to apply when **a**) the other side is Russia, **b**) there are US casualty risks, and/or **c**) there are US market risks. A lot depends on the details, but none would be flashing obviously red for Trump right now.

The other is whether this big show of strength against Iran is **simultaneously projecting weakness** to others. How so? Trump’s new National Defense Strategy spells it out, warning "_one or more potential opponents might act together in a coordinated or opportunistic fashion across multiple theaters._ " It’s framing politely what others (like Rutte and Merz) have already stated bluntly: if Xi ever attacks Taiwan, he’ll coordinate with Putin to split US forces between two theatres. And Trump’s top Pentagon official (Colby) has practically made a career arguing the US can no longer fight two big wars concurrently.

That’s where this big Iran build-up comes in: as spectacular as it is, it’s now taken weeks, and can you guess where the Lincoln carrier group was located the moment Trump redirected it over to the Middle East? It was steaming near the South China Sea.

### Meanwhile, elsewhere…

🇹🇼******TAIWAN** -**Not so fast.**  
US senators have expressed alarm after Taiwan’s more Beijing-friendly opposition advanced a bill to cap key parts of the democracy’s defence procurement at levels way below what Taipei and the Trump administration are seeking. ([_Bloomberg_](<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/taiwan-s-lai-calls-delays-to-special-defense-budget-dangerous>) _$)_

**_Comment:_**_On hold until after this month’s Lunar New Year break, opposition parties argue this bill is about fiscal responsibility and avoiding an unwinnable arms race with the mainland — there’s also the political angle of clipping the ruling party’s wings. Critics argue it’s undermining both_ _**a**_ _) Taiwan’s attempts at ‘porcupine’ deterrence, and_ _**b**_ _) the US-Taiwan ties that strengthen it. Meanwhile, there are also the optics of key Taiwanese opposition figures now visiting Beijing._

🇮🇳******INDIA** -**You’ve got yourself a deal.**  
President Trump says he’s finalised a deal with India’s Modi, trimming US tariffs on Indian goods from 25% to 18% and ditching the additional 25% penalty tied to India’s (slowing) Russian oil purchases. In return? He says India is pledging to buy up to $500B in — and grant more market access for — US goods. ([_BBC_](<https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yve1x9zv0o>) _)_

**_Comment:_**_Trump ended up quietly granting tariff exemptions to vast segments of India’s export base where the US is still reliant (eg pharma). But the tariffs tied to Russian oil did bite, and you can see that in the numbers: Russia has now dropped from India’s top source to number three (behind Iraq and Saudi Arabia), with imports dropping a third in December alone. But it’s still a million bpd away from a full halt._

🇨🇳 **CHINA** \- **More executions.**   
Authorities have executed four members of the infamous Bai family mafia found guilty of running Myanmar scam centres, days after executing 11 members of the Ming family mafia found guilty of related crimes. ([BBC](<https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4e9eqz4rxo>))

**Comment** _: This swift and massive penalty not only plays to President Xi’s corruption crackdown (most scam victims have been nationals of China), but his netizens are also drawing contrasts with the impunity and delays around DC’s Epstein scandal._

🇷🇺 **RUSSIA** \- **Succession.**  
If the rumours are to be believed, the leader of the semi-autonomous Chechen Republic (Kadyrov) is now on his deathbed with kidney failure. That complicates Putin’s succession plan for Chechnya, given Kadyrov’s son and heir apparent was seriously injured in a car accident last month. ([RFE/RL](<https://www.rferl.org/a/chechnya-kadyrov-kremlin-succession-risks-stability/33663761.html>))

🇦🇪 **UAE** \- **Pre-inauguration donation?**   
The Emiratis are still refusing to comment on the Journal’s reporting that, just four days before Trump 2.0’s inauguration, an entity linked to the UAE’s ruling family bought a $500M stake in a crypto venture run by President Trump’s sons. ([WSJ](<https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/spy-sheikh-secret-stake-trump-crypto-tahnoon-ea4d97e8?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqeXeFWdq3cGj26ATXPI8ugYey5IPlVPt6MF82CpTH04ewC3NS261ezgsu3s8QA%3D&gaa_ts=6980dacf&gaa_sig=-r2xju3SHlIdf_9XL3pwZc_ZxFW2TYmCf0AnjjDUFDEJS6qlo6VAaAPOtY7vfd6gFrZzwesAq-j9TW-cJaIOhw%3D%3D>))

**_Comment_** _: The White House is denying claims this $500M payment influenced Trump’s shock decision to sell the Emiratis the world’s most advanced AI chips._

🇨🇦 **CANADA** \- **Uranium deal.**  
Canada and India are reportedly close to finalising a $3B uranium deal for Canada to supply India’s nuclear energy sector, ahead of PM Carney’s visit to India in March. ([Forbes](<https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2026/02/01/canada-nears-3-billion-uranium-deal-with-india-may-be-inked-in-march/>))

**_Comment_** _: We’re old enough to remember 2008, when most major countries still refused to sell India uranium because of its shock 1974 nuclear test which, funnily enough, used a civilian reactor first built with partial Canadian assistance! That whole stand-off ended when the US finally granted India a waiver in late 2008. The more significant part of this new deal is whether (together with Canada’s new-ish PM) we’re seeing a reset in the famously frosty India-Canada ties._

🇨🇷 **COSTA RICA** \- **Right win.**   
As we foreshadowed, the incumbent’s preferred conservative candidate, 39-year-old Laura Fernandez, has won Costa Rica’s presidential election, pledging to double-down on economic development and security. ([Al Jazeera](<https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/2/laura-fernandez-leads-early-results-in-costa-ricas-presidential-election>))

🇺🇸 **UNITED STATES** \- **To the moon!**   
Elon Musk’s SpaceX has confirmed it’s buying umm… Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI, in what could become the most valuable private company ever (over $1T). Meanwhile, Ukraine has thanked Musk for cracking down on Russia’s use of his Starlink satellites for drone attacks on Ukraine. ([CNN](<https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/02/tech/spacex-acquires-xai-elon-musk>))

### Extra Intrigue

**Here’s what the world’s prediction markets are now forecasting**

  * 🧑‍⚖️ There are equal 13% odds of the **International Court of Justice** and Donald Trump winning the 2027 Nobel Peace Prize. 

  * 🇯🇵 There are 99% odds Sanae Takaichi will continue as **Japan’s** PM following this Sunday’s upcoming snap elections. 

  * 🇺🇸 There’s a 24% chance **US** Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem will be the first of Trump’s cabinet to leave the administration (part of the ICE fallout). 




### Grammy of the day

Among all the Bad Bunnies, Burna Boys, and Jelly Rolls strutting up on stage to collect their Grammys on Sunday, one winner caught our attention in-absentia.

That’s because the night’s ~~highly-anticipated~~ _Best Audio Book, Narration and Storytelling Recording_ award went to none other than the Dalai Lama! It was for his self-explanatorily-named work, _Meditations: The Reflections of His Holiness the Dalai Lama_.

And given China’s crackdown on Tibetan Buddhism, how did Beijing respond to this news? The foreign ministry dismissed it as a “ _tool for anti-China political manipulation_ ”. 

**P.S.** If you’re curious why China is gearing up for a fight to nominate the Dalai Lama’s successor, we explored that [here](<https://www.internationalintrigue.io/the-geopolitics-of-the-next-dalai-lama/>).
