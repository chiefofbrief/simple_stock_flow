## Stock & Markets Analysis

### 1. Market & Macro Overview
The market exhibits a **Cautionary Posture**, characterized by a tech-led selloff in the Nasdaq and signs of labor-market weakness (WSJ Markets #1). While the "Reflexive Boom" in AI continues to drive massive capital allocation, investor sentiment is testing the "Return on Investment" phase, punishing high spending without immediate returns.
*   **Commodities:** Oil prices are falling due to easing US-Iran tensions (Barrons #36), and Silver has plunged after a brief rebound (WSJ Markets #29).
*   **Macro:** Jobs data suggests cooling (WSJ Markets #1), potentially shifting the Fed's calculus, though credit card issuers remain robust despite stalled rate caps (WSJ Markets #2).

### 2. AI Ecosystem Positioning (Sector-Specific)
*   **The Reflexive Loop:** Google's guidance for $175–$185B in 2026 CapEx (Reddit r/ValueInvesting #1) is a definitive "Reflexive" signal. The loop is **accelerating**, not normalizing. Hyperscalers are absorbing massive risk to build infrastructure, subsidizing the ecosystem. The market's negative reaction (Barrons #40) highlights the tension between "Empire Building" and shareholder returns.
*   **Compute & Infrastructure (Layers 1-3):** The CapEx flood is flowing directly to suppliers. Nvidia and Broadcom rose on Google's spending plans (Barrons #50). However, physical bottlenecks are shifting: a "memory crunch" is now impacting downstream players like Qualcomm and Arm (Barrons #31). Cummins (CMI) is seeing earnings driven by data-center power demand, validating the "Power bottleneck" thesis (Barrons #34).
*   **Models & Tools (Layers 4-7):** OpenAI is moving into the "Agent" space with a new enterprise platform (Barrons #33), signaling further consolidation and pressure on standalone SaaS "wrapper" companies.
*   **Applications (Layer 8):** Fears that AI will kill the software business model are present but debated (WSJ Markets #9). The "Revenue Gap" remains the key hurdle.

### 3. Applied Investment Flags (General)
*   **The Glamour Metrics Trap:** Ralph Lauren (Barrons #25) and Snap (Barrons #1) both posted positive news/earnings that failed to lift their stocks. This divergence suggests that "good news" is already fully priced in, or that quality of earnings (e.g., Snap's user growth vs. revenue) is suspect.
*   **Economic Reality vs. GAAP:** NIO posted its first quarterly profit (Barrons #22). Given the capital-intensive nature of EVs and aggressive competition, this warrants a deep dive into *how* profit was achieved (e.g., subsidies, one-time items) versus genuine operational cash flow.
*   **Mispricing vs. Impairment:** Peloton (Barrons #46) continues to plummet with members fleeing. This looks like "Structural Impairment" rather than a temporary mispricing. Conversely, Qualcomm and Arm (Barrons #31) suffering from a "memory crunch" (supply chain issue) might represent a temporary "Solvable Problem" creating a mispricing.
*   **Reflexivity & Fertile Fallacies:** The market's recoil at Google's CapEx (Reddit r/ValueInvesting #1) questions the "Fertile Fallacy" that AI demand is infinite. If the "Application Layer" doesn't monetize soon, this CapEx could turn from a "Moat" into a massive capital destruction cycle.

### 4. Screening Candidates

*   **Ticker/Theme:** **GOOGL (Alphabet)**
*   **The Signal:** (Reddit r/ValueInvesting #1), (Barrons #40)
*   **What News Says:** Google guides for $175B–$185B CapEx in 2026, up from ~$50B in 2024. Stock fell ~4-5%.
*   **The Why:** This is the ultimate "Reflexive" test. The market hates the spend, but if the "Circular Loop" holds, this builds an insurmountable compute moat.
*   **Investigation Items:** Verify the breakdown of this CapEx (Infrastructure vs. R&D). Investigate "Depreciation Risk" of this hardware.
*   **Data Gap:** Need to verify Cash Flow from Operations coverage of this CapEx. Can they fund this organically?

*   **Ticker/Theme:** **NIO**
*   **The Signal:** (Barrons #22)
*   **What News Says:** EV maker sees first quarterly profit; stock jumps.
*   **The Why:** "Economic Reality" check. Is this a sustainable turnaround or accounting magic?
*   **Investigation Items:** Check "Cash Flow from Operations" vs. "Net Income". Look for government subsidies or asset sales.
*   **Data Gap:** Need full financial statements to analyze margin quality.

*   **Ticker/Theme:** **QCOM (Qualcomm) / ARM**
*   **The Signal:** (Barrons #31)
*   **What News Says:** Stocks drop due to "memory crunch" forcing phone makers to cut production.
*   **The Why:** "Mispricing" candidate. Is the memory shortage a temporary cyclical bottleneck or a longer-term structural issue? If temporary, the selloff offers an entry into high-quality royalty/chip businesses.
*   **Investigation Items:** Search for memory pricing trends and supply expansion timelines (e.g., HBM production taking capacity from standard DRAM).
*   **Data Gap:** Duration of memory supply shortage.

*   **Ticker/Theme:** **CMI (Cummins)**
*   **The Signal:** (Barrons #34)
*   **What News Says:** Earnings driven by data-center demand; stock down (likely due to broader market or specific writedown mentioned).
*   **The Why:** "Picks and Shovels" play on the Power Constraint thesis (AI Layer 3).
*   **Investigation Items:** Separate "Data Center" revenue growth from legacy engine business. Assess the "Writedown" mentioned ($1.54/share).
*   **Data Gap:** Order backlog for data center backup power systems.

# 🌍 Three intriguing elections

Plus: France’s two surprising spies

Feb 5, 2026

**Today’s briefing:**  
— Three intriguing elections  
— France’s two surprising spies  
— Italy’s one familiar angel

**Good morning {{first_name | Intriguer}}**. Sometimes it’s worth dressing to fit the local vibes. That’s why I duly donned a sulu in Fiji, a guayabera in Guatemala, and a soft-knit sleeveless cardigan in Canberra.

But there was one outfit I couldn’t bring myself to try. A decade ago I was on a work trip in **Myanmar**(whose **sham election** we explore today), around the time everyone was excited about this beautiful country’s democratic transition.

Rolling through the eerie Naypyidaw capital (which paranoid generals secretly carved out of the jungle to fortify themselves against urban unrest), I noticed military bigwigs sporting a kind of 70s-era safari suit, featuring aggressively-short short-shorts. _Lots_ of thigh.

And I remember thinking, okay it’s hot, it’s humid, and you’ve got some respectable calf game there Colonel, but c’mon man, put on some pants.

### Number of the day

**$250B**

That’s the estimated amount Argentines have stashed away in hiding places, offshore accounts, and deposit boxes, _six times_ the central bank’s dollar reserves! President Milei is hoping he can convince citizens to normalise that cash back into Argentina’s stabilising economy. 

### **Election season**

Remember 2024? Us neither. But we are reliably told it was the world’s biggest-ever electoral year, with a majority of eligible voters invited to the polls. It felt like the new world order was being decided. And in many ways, that’s exactly what happened.

But 2026 is shaping up to be another historic electoral year for folks in one of the world’s most dynamic yet overlooked regions, so let’s get you up to speed, starting with…

  1. **Myanmar** 🇲🇲




The ✌️results✌️ are in! There are not enough sassy air-quotes in all the internet to tell you about this sham election in junta-run Myanmar, so we’ll just use that one pair above when we confirm that, omg, Myanmar’s military-backed party has won! 

**A few fun facts** : 

  * Under Myanmar’s military-drafted constitution, guess who automatically gets a veto-proof **25% of all seats**? That’s right, they’re for generals selected by the commander-in-chief himself! And speaking of…

  * The constitution bars Myanmar’s top general and current dictator (Min Aung Hlaing) from being **both president and military chief**. So he’ll now abdicate his military role to become president, right? Haha no. He’s set up a new ‘consultative council’ that’ll preserve his full military control, just via a new desk plaque.




And what about Myanmar’s **brutal civil war** , you might ask? The junta only controls maybe a quarter of the country, covering perhaps 50-70% of the population. And in addition to banning or sidelining opposition parties, the generals only ran polls in a subset of those controlled communities they consider “ _stable_ ” (ie, their own strongholds).

So… **why bother?** Five years since toppling the democratically-elected government in a coup, it’s the regime’s attempt at boosting its own legitimacy at home and abroad. For us, one of the highlights has been neighbouring **China**(famously a big fan of elections) [endorsing](<https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/eng/xw/fyrbt/202601/t20260126_11845427.html>) the process as a path to peace and reconciliation — Beijing’s core interest is stabilising its border region and remaining tight with Myanmar’s mercurial generals.

  2. **Thailand** 🇹🇭




Across another Myanmar border we’ve got Thailand’s snap general election this Sunday, and it’s intriguing for so many reasons.

**First** , it’s Thailand’s first full election under this constitution **without a military-appointed senate** playing a decisive role in who ends up prime minister! 

The result might be a familiar scene: a power struggle between a royal-military establishment and reformists gunning for change. And that leads us to…

**Second** , there’s **a cast of characters** not holding back. For example…

**The ruling incumbent**(Anutin), a tycoon running Thailand’s third-largest party, has long tried to position himself as **the ‘middleman’** solution to gridlock: acceptable to both…

  * the establishment (he’s been a nationalist in the Cambodia border clashes), and

  * the reformists (he decriminalised cannabis as health minister!).




So he’s trying to rally votes with spicy lines like this: “ _If Thai people want a government chosen by Cambodia, then go ahead and vote for those two parties._ ” __ 🌶️🌶️🌶️

With this one line, he was dunking on both **a**) opposition reformists like 38-year-old front-runner **Natthaphong** , whose party lineage crushed the last elections but was blocked from power, and **b**) populists like Thailand’s powerful **Shinawatra** family, whose patriarch, sister, and daughter have now all been ousted from the top job by the establishment. 

And **third** , voters are also casting their ballot in **a referendum**! It’s asking if voters want to draft a new constitution, but it’s being seen as a proxy vote on the military’s role in Thai politics. 🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️

And now let’s cross back over yet another of Myanmar’s restive borders to visit...

  3. **Bangladesh** 🇧🇩




The rebel rousers. The OG Gen Z protestors. Where else did student protests get so big, the long-time strongwoman leader (Sheikh Hasina) had to flee to India in a chopper!

Anyway, post-Sheikh Bangladesh is finally holding elections next week (Thurs 12th), 18 months after Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus stepped in as interim leader.

And with Sheikh’s party banned, it’s **a two-horse race** between…

  * A **nationalist** -conservative party led by Tarique Rahman (an ex-PM’s son), and

  * An **Islamist** party at the head of an 11-party coalition (including the students).




Assuming (per the polls) **the nationalists win** , they’re pledging anti-corruption and reconciliation. As for Bangladesh’s role in the world? That’s not been a campaign issue, but the nationalists want an “ _economy-based_ ” stance, which basically means a classic strategy to hedge everyone (India, China, US, Pakistan) to Bangladesh’s advantage.

In the meantime, a handful of local embassies (US, UK, Canada) are warning of the risks of extremist violence around election day. 

We’re barely scratching a single region’s surface here: cross yet another of Myanmar’s borders and you’ll enter tiny **Laos** , which is scheduled for elections on February 22nd — though as a one-party state, the outcome ain’t in doubt. Ditto in nearby **Vietnam** , where there are one-party elections next month, though the real election happened last month, when the communist party consolidated Tô Lâm’s grip on power. 

#### Intrigue’s Take

Fascinating neighbourhood, right? Looking out across a single nation’s borders, you’ll see politics dominated by generals, communists, royals, and beyond.

But what’s the bigger picture? **One** is the way these establishments keep trying to anchor democratic transitions by **entrenching their own veto power** — think Myanmar's generals locking in that 25% seat guarantee, or Thailand's military quietly shaping the senate — only to arguably just plant the seeds for more volatility down the line, particularly amid such young and increasingly active electorates.

The **second** is actually **critical minerals** , because China relies on restive Myanmar for more than half its supply of niche heavy rare earth elements like dysprosium and terbium, essential for EVs and wind turbines. Ditto, the US just signed a critical minerals deal with Thailand in October, aiming to leverage the country’s quiet processing strengths as a China-alternative node in Western supply chains for energy and defence tech.

A **third** is that eventually, **politics hits the economy**. Thailand is now on track to record ASEAN’s slowest growth (ex-Myanmar), but Bangladesh is another example — it’s due to graduate from ‘least developed country’ status this November, but instead of preparing for the loss of duty-free perks that underpin its textiles sector (80% of exports!), it’s been paralysed by political intrigue.

**_Sound even smarter:_**

  * Japanese voters also head to the polls this Sunday in an election almost certain to [consolidate PM Sanae Takaichi’s position](<https://www.internationalintrigue.io/three-big-stories-out-of-japan-nuclear-elections-and-out-of-control-bonds/>).

  * Nepal will then hold its first general election next month after [huge Gen Z protests](<https://www.internationalintrigue.io/gen-z-rises-up-in-nepal/>) rocked the country last year. 




### Meanwhile, elsewhere…

🇬🇧******UNITED KINGDOM** -**Another Epstein casualty?**  
Prime Minister Starmer is facing growing anger from his own party over attempts to withhold information about his appointment of Peter Mandelson as (ex) ambassador to the US. Mandelson, a close friend of Jeffrey Epstein, is now facing serious allegations he leaked sensitive information to Epstein. ([Guardian](<https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/feb/04/labour-mps-say-starmer-days-as-pm-are-numbered-amid-fury-over-mandelson>))

**Comment** : _This has really escalated for Starmer, with his own parliamentarians now briefing the UK’s famously rabid tabloids that his days might be numbered. But the question is who’s capable of replacing him, given one obvious name (his own former deputy, Angela Rayner) is still grappling with a possible tax scandal._

🇫🇷******FRANCE** -**AirBnSpy.**  
Paris authorities have arrested two citizens of China on suspicions they tried using a Starlink connection — plus their own big satellite dish — to intercept sensitive military and government data from their AirBnB near Bordeaux. ([Politico](<https://www.politico.eu/article/france-police-arrest-2-china-citizen-access-military-data-starlink/>))

🇨🇳 **CHINA** -**Busy phones.**  
President Xi has used his latest video-call with Russia’s Putin to propose work on a “ _grand plan_ ” to deepen their vaunted no-limits partnership. The same day, Xi held a call with President Trump covering Taiwan, Ukraine, Iran, and trade. ([Reuters](<https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/xi-putin-hail-ties-video-call-ukraine-war-nears-anniversary-2026-02-04/>))

**_Comment_** _: The DC and Beijing read-outs each had their own familiar angle on the Trump-Xi call, but they both set a pretty constructive tone ahead of their planned April summit in China._

🇨🇺 **CUBA** -**Interesting plane you’ve got there…**  
A sanctioned Russian cargo plane that previously delivered air defence systems to Venezuela has now landed in Cuba, though it’s unclear what might be onboard this time. Cuba and Russia signed a military cooperation agreement last March, facilitating the possible supply of specialists and equipment. ([DefenceNews](<https://www.defensenews.com/global/the-americas/2026/02/02/russian-cargo-plane-arrives-in-cuba-echoing-frantic-caracas-buildup/>))

**_Comment_** _: Russia’s cargo delivery last October did little (if anything) to help Maduro, and it’s hard to see it making any meaningful difference for Cuba either. It looks like further evidence, however, that a common link seeking to thwart so many of Trump’s foreign priorities (Venezuela, Cuba, China, Iran, North Korea) is… Putin._

🇹🇼 **TAIWAN** \- **Counter budget.**   
President Lai has warned that if Taiwan’s more Beijing-friendly opposition continues to block a planned US arms package, it “ _could lead the international community to misunderstand Taiwan’s determination to defend itself._ ” In response to US senate concerns, the opposition [argues](<https://x.com/kuomintang/status/2018715252733726799>) it supports strengthening Taiwan’s defence, but won’t sign blank checks, and wants more funding for soldier pay. ([Taipei Times)](<https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2026/02/05/2003851794>)

🇳🇬 **NIGERIA** \- **Another massacre.**   
Authorities have blamed an ISIS-linked group for a massacre in western Nigeria’s Kwara state that’s left ~170 (!) predominantly-Muslim villagers dead. ([DW](<https://www.dw.com/en/nigeria-extremists-kill-over-100-in-western-villages/a-75807223>))

**_Comment_** _: That’s the same state where the US hit ISIS targets at Nigeria’s request around Christmas. Meanwhile, the US has confirmed it’s now deployed a small military team (intel, training) to support Nigeria’s anti-terrorism efforts._

###  Extra Intrigue

**Meanwhile, in other worlds…**

  * **Media** : The Washington Post has [laid off a third of its staff](<https://www.theguardian.com/media/2026/feb/04/washington-post-layoffs>), drastically reducing its international coverage to focus on “ _national security issues_ ”.

  * **Space** : China has dropped a concept video for [a futuristic space carrier](<https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/china-star-wars-space-plane-video-b2913034.html>) with unmanned fighter jets (even optimistic state outlets say it’s still 20-30 years away). 

  * **Tech** : A California-based software company has launched [Moltbook, a social media platform](<https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62n410w5yno>) exclusively for… not humans, but AI.




### Painting of the day

Does that angel above look familiar? She’s recently made a brief but scandalous appearance in one of Rome’s oldest churches, the ~4th century Basilica of San Lorenzo.

When the resident priest asked parishioner and local artist Bruno Valentinetti for help restoring the 17th century fresco, Bruno must’ve said something like _hold my Peroni_ , because he ended up making the cherub look _exactly_ like Italy’s leader, Giorgia Meloni.

Once pics started circulating online, criticism ensued across the media, the opposition, and even the Vatican, until Bruno quietly removed his Giorgia touch this week. Why’d he do it? Bruno won’t say.

**Your two cents:**

  * ✍️ **T.C:** “Not much will happen that wasn't already happening - nuclear weapon delivery systems and defense systems will continue to advance, but there won't be a massive scale up in the number of weapons.”
