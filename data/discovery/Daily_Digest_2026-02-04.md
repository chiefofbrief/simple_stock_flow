## Stock & Markets Analysis

### 1. Market & Macro Overview
The market is shifting into a **"Cautionary Posture"** as the "Reflexive Boom" in Software/AI faces its first major structural test. The NASDAQ is pulling back from all-time highs (-4%) amid an **"indiscriminate selling"** event in the software sector (Reddit ValueInvesting #5).
* **Indicators:** 
    * **Labor Market Cooling:** ADP Private Payrolls missed significantly (22k vs 48k expected), signaling high rates are finally impacting employment (WSJ #26, #14).
    * **Geopolitical Risk:** The New START nuclear treaty expires Thursday with no extension, increasing macro uncertainty (Intrigue #1).
    * **Commodities:** Gold continues its resurgence (WSJ #1) while Oil trades sideways as U.S.-Iran talks loom (WSJ #23).
* **Sentiment:** High-conviction AI winners (AMD, MSFT) are seeing "sell the news" reactions despite fundamental beats, suggesting a potential **"Turning Point"** where price action is no longer reinforcing the "Fertile Fallacy" of infinite AI growth (Barron's #33).

### 2. AI Ecosystem Positioning (Sector-Specific)
* **The Reflexive Loop:** A "Software Bloodbath" (WSJ #6) was triggered by a niche Anthropic tool release (Reddit ValueInvesting #3), causing a $300B wipeout. This highlights the **"Flaw in Consensus"**: that SaaS moats are impenetrable. The market is now pricing in an "Extinction Event" for traditional software (Reddit Stocks #6).
* **Compute & Infrastructure (Layers 1-3):** **AMD** (-16.7%) and **NVIDIA** (-3.7%) are struggling as the market shifts from "AI Hope" to "Near-Term Reality." CEO Lisa Su's 2027 outlook is deemed "too far away" by current sentiment (Barron's #33, #48). **Prologis** is looking to capitalize on physical bottlenecks by funding data centers (WSJ #17).
* **Applications (Layer 8):** **Microsoft (MSFT)** and **Palantir (PLTR)** are seeing massive market cap losses despite strong results (Reddit Stocks #1). The "Subsidy Effect" is being questioned as software vendors (ADBE, CRM, INTU) see multi-year low multiples (Reddit ValueInvesting #5, Stocks #15).

### 3. Applied Investment Flags (General)
* **Economic Reality vs. GAAP:** **Oracle** is under scrutiny as the Nvidia/OpenAI relationship puts its accounting practices in the spotlight (WSJ #9). **Mercury Systems (MRCY)** smashed EPS (16c vs 7c) but fell 23%, suggesting a divergence between reported beats and underlying economic health (Barron's #6).
* **Mispricing vs. Impairment:** 
    * **Software/SaaS:** The sector selloff is the worst since 2008 (Reddit ValueInvesting #3). If the AI threat is a "solvable problem" rather than "structural impairment," this is a generational buy level for quality names like **MSFT** and **ADBE** (Reddit Options #1).
    * **Novo Nordisk (NVO):** Down 12% on a 2026 sales warning. Is US pricing pressure a "permanent impairment" of the GLP-1 thesis or a temporary "pessimism bargain"? (Reddit ValueInvesting #7, #8).
* **The Glamour Metrics Trap:** Solar stocks (**ENPH**) are surging 24% after a battering (Barron's #39). This reflexive bounce must be checked for sustainable EPS growth vs. a temporary "clouds lifting" narrative.
* **Reflexivity & Fertile Fallacies:** The narrative that "AI kills SaaS" is being reinforced by price action, potentially creating an **"Edge Opportunity"** for those who can identify which software moats (e.g., orchestration/data services) remain intact.

### 4. Screening Candidates

* **Ticker/Theme:** **MSFT (Microsoft)** / AI Infrastructure & SaaS
* **The Signal:** Reddit Stocks #1, Options #1. Down significantly despite "best results ever."
* **What News Says:** Market cap loss in one day exceeded half of its OpenAI stake value. P/E is now in the low 20s.
* **The Why:** A high-quality business caught in a reflexive sector-wide selloff. Classic "Investment vs. Speculation" middle ground.
* **Investigation Items:**
    - Verify "Economic Reality" of the $600B AI revenue gap impact on Azure margins.
    - Dispute or validate the "SaaS Extinction" narrative using historical parallels (e.g., Dotcom bubble high-flyers vs. survivors).
* **Data Gap:** Specific breakdown of AI-driven vs. traditional Cloud revenue growth to assess "Execution Year" progress.

* **Ticker/Theme:** **MRCY (Mercury Systems)** / Defense Contractor
* **The Signal:** Barron's #6, Losers Table.
* **What News Says:** EPS beat by 128% (16c vs 7c), yet the stock fell ~23%.
* **The Why:** Extreme divergence between earnings performance and market reaction. Potential "solvable one-time problem" or hidden "Red Flag" in guidance.
* **Investigation Items:**
    - Review the Q4 transcript for "Expense Manipulation" or "Disappointing Outlook" (Barron's #30, #35).
    - Compare cash flow vs. reported EPS beat to check for "Revenue Manipulation" (percentage-of-completion).
* **Data Gap:** Specific reason for the 23% drop despite the beat (e.g., backlog depletion or one-time settlement).

* **Ticker/Theme:** **NVO (Novo Nordisk)** / Healthcare
* **The Signal:** Reddit ValueInvesting #7, #8.
* **What News Says:** Warning of lower 2026 sales/profit due to U.S. pricing pressure.
* **The Why:** A "Glamour Stock" facing a "Turning Point." The critical test is whether this is a "permanent structural impairment" due to Medicare price negotiations.
* **Investigation Items:**
    - Validate pricing pressure claims against Eli Lilly's (LLY) concurrent earnings/guidance.
    - Analyze the "Economic Reality" of volume growth vs. net price erosion.
* **Data Gap:** Precise impact of the U.S. Medicare rate decision vs. global demand.

* **Ticker/Theme:** **PYPL (PayPal)** / Fintech
* **The Signal:** Reddit Stocks #3, ValueInvesting #12.
* **What News Says:** CEO fired, revenue missed, stock down 27%. "Death Spiral" math being discussed by bulls.
* **The Why:** "Out-of-favor situation" (management upheaval + disappointment). Buying at a "bargain price" relative to intrinsic value if the core business isn't impaired.
* **Investigation Items:**
    - Investigate "Corporate Culture Deterioration" leading to the CEO exit.
    - Verify if branded checkout slowdown is a "permanent impairment" from Apple/AI.
* **Data Gap:** Margin contribution from Braintree vs. unbranded processing in the latest quarter.

* **Ticker/Theme:** **ENPH (Enphase Energy)** / Solar
* **The Signal:** Barron's #39, Most Actives.
* **What News Says:** Surged 24% after beating expectations; "clouds are lifting."
* **The Why:** Reflexive recovery in a beaten-down sector. Is the "Margin of Safety" still there after a 24% pop?
* **Investigation Items:**
    - Verify the impact of Trump’s tax bill on future CLEAN energy subsidies.
    - Check for "Channel Stuffing" signals in the inventory recovery narrative.
* **Data Gap:** Inventory levels at European vs. U.S. distributors.

# 🌍 The last US-Russia nuke pact dies

Plus: The ambassador has a boss

Feb 4, 2026

**Today’s briefing:**  
— The last US-Russia nuke pact dies  
— Go join the Peace Corps in Vietnam  
— The ambassador has a boss

**Good morning {{first_name | Intriguer}}**. If you’re like me, you’d probably not heard of this thing called **the New START treaty**. Or thought it referred to a student loan forgiveness program for those who sought a… new start.

In actual fact, this rather benign sounding treaty is actually quite the big deal. It refers to the last remaining nuclear arms control pact between the US and Russia, and is due to expire Thursday. Just when we thought 2026 had enough nerve-wracking moments.

That’s our top story today, so let’s dive in.

### Number of the day

**521**

That’s how many missiles and drones Putin launched at Ukraine overnight, days after President Trump reported Putin would hit pause due to Ukraine’s brutal winter. 

### **Nuclear reaction**

Some things are good to let expire — like your ✌️free✌️ LinkedIn Premium trial, or that Salesforce subscription sending you breathless 2am emails about Q4 pipeline hygiene.

But what about the last remaining nuclear treaty between the two powers still sitting on ~90% of the world’s nukes?

That’s what happens tomorrow (Thursday), when the US-Russia _**New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty**_ (New START) expires, with no clear plans on what’s next.

So with that cheerful swan-dive into your inbox, let’s get you briefed, starting back in…

📅 **8 April 2010**

The Burj Khalifa had just opened, the first iPad had just gone on sale, and KFC had just announced its new ‘Double Down’ burger, innovatively using fried chicken as the bread.

Meanwhile, President Obama appeared in Prague to sign **New START** with Russia’s then-president, Dmitry Medvedev. This was back when… 

  * The world still saw **Medvedev** as a younger, more reformist Russian leader, and

  * Lavrov and Clinton had just pushed their famous novelty ‘**reset** ’ button in Geneva.




So with Obama diagnosing US-Russia ties as entering a “ _**dangerous drift**_ ”, and their original START treaty having just expired in December 2009, this new treaty pledged to...

  * **~Halve their nukes** to a maximum of 1,550 deployed warheads, and

  * Resume **on-site inspections** to ensure they were each upholding their end.




In theory, it was all about reducing risks, cutting costs, restoring transparency, and rebuilding trust, all without giving up any meaningful military advantage.

**So… did it work?**

A State staffer famously mistranslated that big novelty ‘reset’ button as ‘**overload** ’ in Russian, hinting at some of the trouble to come, but things started out okay: the two old foes slashed their nukes while ticking off 328 inspections and ~25,000 notifications.

There were spats, but nothing to stop Biden and Putin signing a 5-year renewal in 2021, until**things went sour** — Putin attacked Ukraine, then paused his treaty participation after the US helped Ukraine defend itself. But the treaty was already wobbly, because…

  * **Covid** had halted in-person inspections

  * Putin argued the US was exploiting **loopholes** , and

  * The US had already elected its own START-sceptic president (**Trump**).




**Their complaints?**

**Putin** argued US defence tech was undermining the treaty by neutralising Russia’s nukes, whether via defence (anti-ballistic systems) or offence (non-nuclear fast-strikes).

And **Trump** hated the way the treaty tied America’s hands while allowing China’s own massive nuclear ramp-up; he also accused Putin of cheating on a related 1987 treaty via Russia’s new SSC-8 cruise missile. Trump ditched that treaty in 2019, and Putin now uses that missile against Ukrainian cities (turns out it’s got double the range Putin claimed).

**And as for those hopes of a new Russia?** Medvedev turned out to be Putin’s seat-warmer, not to mention a fascist drunk. And the Kremlin went on to assassinate more critics, steal more turf (Crimea), prop up Syria’s Assad regime, interfere in the 2016 US election, carry out historic cyberattacks (SolarWinds), then start a full war on Ukraine.

And… that pretty much brings us to today! So will the US and Russia extend New START?

**Neither side is keen** — Putin’s extension offer is only for a year, and wouldn’t include on-site inspections (so it’s worthless). Plus he’s now testing the “ _invincible weapons_ ” he announced back in 2018 as a very naked way to evade New START limits — eg, his Burevestnik _ground_ -launched missile or his Poseidon drone submarine.

Meanwhile, Trump wants to resume some nuclear testing plus his big Golden Dome defence plans. He also says he can deliver a better deal that’d include China, but Xi has zero interest in slowing down — he just _more-than-doubled_ his own arsenal to ~600 in five years.

#### Intrigue’s Take

The Cold War brought us dangerously close to nuclear annihilation, whether 1962’s Cuban missile crisis, or 1983’s Able Archer scare. On that last point, **MI6’s greatest (known) spy** in history, KGB officer Oleg Gordievsky, ended up providing the Brits with striking insights into Soviet thinking: even with all available intel confirming Archer was seriously just a US drill, they _viewed that evidence itself_ as mere deception to mask an imminent US strike!

At one point, the Soviets even stole secret NATO war plans confirming the bloc was indeed just defensive, but even that wasn’t enough — Moscow officials later [told](<https://nipp.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/OP-7-for-web-final.pdf>) their exasperated American counterparts: “ _**We simply did not believe that.**_ ” 

So sometimes Western leaders come along, convinced **sheer sincerity and charm** might be enough to break the cycle: FDR told his treasury secretary, “ _if I could just talk to Stalin personally, I could straighten it all out_ ”; Bush Jr famously claimed he’d seen Putin’s soul; Obama tried the big reset button; and Trump still seems to believe in his Putin rapport.

Meanwhile, sure, treaties help — in fact, it was precisely during the Cold War’s scariest years that these two foes agreed on their historic pacts, whether to ban certain nuclear tests, demilitarise Outer Space and the Antarctic, and even halt the yawning ozone hole.

But any Western gesture still risks getting stuck downstream of trust, and trust is ultimately downstream of ideology: that’s because ultimately, Putin is still projecting the Kremlin’s historic "_кто кого_ " ("_who’ll vanquish whom_ ") binary onto the world around it.

### Meanwhile, elsewhere…

🇮🇷**IRAN — Drone down.**  
The US Navy has reportedly shot down an Iranian drone that “ _aggressively approached_ ” the USS Abraham Lincoln. Hours later, Iranian forces threatened to (but didn’t) board a US-flagged tanker transiting the Strait of Hormuz. ([CNBC](<https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/03/us-military-shoots-down-iranian-drone-that-aggressively-approached-aircraft-carrier.html>))

**Comment** : _The drone incident alone was enough to spike oil markets by 1% — the White House still says Iran talks will continue. We explored this one_ _[yesterday](<https://www.internationalintrigue.io/us-and-iran-on-brink-again/>)_ _._

🇷🇺**RUSSIA — Compromised communications.**  
EU officials believe Russia has intercepted some 10 key satellites over Europe, compromising their comms and potentially enabling Moscow to manoeuvre or destroy them. ([FT](<https://www.ft.com/content/cd08c49c-658e-49c9-9a15-234f2bfc2074>) $)

**Comment** : _At this point, the only surprising thing about these stories is the way legacy outlets still act shocked — anything of value not beyond an airgap (plus military grade encryption) has quite likely been compromised for years._

🇱🇾**LIBYA — Son down.**  
Someone has assassinated the son and once-heir apparent of Libya’s late dictator (Gaddafi) in his home southwest of Tripoli. ([Al-Jazeera](<https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/3/saif-al-islam-gaddafi-son-of-former-leader-killed-in-libya>))

**Comment** : _There’s a long list of suspects given Junior’s pivot from the more urbane face of his dad’s regime, to a core architect of his brutal 2011 crackdown._

🇪🇸 **SPAIN — Go touch grass.**  
Spain’s Pedro Sánchez has announced his government will seek to ban social media access for under-16s in a bid to shield kids from online harm and (via big penalties on platform executives) reassert democratic control. ([NYT](<https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/03/world/europe/spain-social-media-ban-under-16.html>))

**Comment** : _Sanchez is just the latest to join Australia’s historic U-16s ban, which we_ _[explored](<https://www.internationalintrigue.io/australian-under-16s-face-social-media-ban/>)_ _when it entered force weeks ago. Greece might be next. Meanwhile,__[a familiar spat](<https://x.com/FrenchResponse/status/2018818868706509238>)_ _has erupted between_ _**France and X**_ _(née Twitter), with Paris describing its latest raid on X offices as part of a criminal probe into child exploitation material, while Musk argues it’s just censorship masquerading as child-safety._

🇦🇺 **AUSTRALIA** **— Love us some aviation news.**  
Japan’s main development bank is stepping in to help re-shore control of Jetstar Japan, a budget carrier first launched by Australia’s flag carrier, Qantas. ([Skift](<https://skift.com/2026/02/03/qantas-to-exit-jetstar-japan-as-airline-shifts-to-full-japanese-control/>))

**Comment** : _Why? The development bank’s involvement suggests some kind of policy goal for Japan — probably to_ _**a**_ _) capture more of the inbound tourism boom,__**b**_ _) redirect more visitors beyond Tokyo, and_ _**c**_ _) further expand Japan’s budget airline segment. As for Qantas, its new CEO is exiting capital-intensive investments abroad to refocus on Australia’s famously_ _~~expensive~~_ _profitable routes back home, while freeing up cash for some much-needed fleet renewal._

🇨🇴**COLOMBIA — Change of pace.**  
In a turnaround for the ages, President Trump has gone from declaring his Colombian counterpart (Petro) an “ _illegal drug leader_ ” and revoking his US visa, to praising him as “ _terrific_ ” and even signalling renewed counternarcotics work. ([AP](<https://apnews.com/article/trump-colombia-petro-venezuela-36bc47d628886ea20c471a63156ec550>))

**Comment** : _Why the sudden change of heart? Trump needs Colombia’s help to stabilise Venezuela next door, while stable US ties might help Petro’s left-leaning successor (Senator Cepeda), who faces a tough May election against a resurgent right._

🇺🇸**UNITED STATES — My precious.**  
President Trump has announced a new $12B critical mineral stockpile to counter China’s supply chain dominance. Dubbed ‘Project Vault’, it’ll reportedly involve another 11 countries to be announced later this week. ([Guardian](<https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/03/trump-critical-minerals-stockpile-project-vault>))

**Comment** : _Pitched as today’s equivalent to a strategic petroleum reserve, it’s part of DC’s continued adaptation to the reality (made painfully clear last year) that China has massive critical mineral leverage over the US, particularly in processing._

🇰🇬**KYRGYZSTAN — Bypass no more.**  
The EU is reportedly preparing to sanction Kyrgyzstan for helping Russia evade Western restrictions, potentially making it the first Central Asian country to face EU sanctions as Brussels targets Moscow’s economic loopholes. ([EurasiaNet](<https://eurasianet.org/eu-ready-to-impose-sanctions-on-kyrgyzstan-report\]>))

### Meme of the day

A recent edition’s ad reminded us of the above viral Intrigue meme. Don’t be distracted by John Daly’s happy pants, or the fact he’s casually punching an on-green dart at the 150th Open in Scotland, or the humorous contrast with a more staid-looking Tiger Woods.

The key message is that if you think making ambassador means you’re now the boss, you’re wrong. The boss is still actually the embassy’s long-serving local employee who’s calmly watched 10 of your ambassadorial predecessors come and go, and will eventually watch you depart too, but not before politely (and correctly) explaining why you’re wrong.

### Today’s poll

### What do you think will happen after New START expires?

  * [🚀 A nuclear arms race](<https://archives.internationalintrigue.io/login>)

**Yesterday’s poll:** Do you think Trump will hit Iran again?

❌**** No, it's a bluff to force concessions (21%)  
✅ Yes, he wants regime change (29%)  
🧐 **Just limited strikes to shape talks (48%)**  
✍️ Other (write us!) (2%)

**Your two cents:**

  * 🧐 **J.S:** “He wants concessions to get back to a deal that Obama had already inked. The only difference will be the cash he puts in his pocket as a result.”

  * ❌ **P.F:** “It's a bluff but if the concessions don't come... boom.”

  * ✅**M.P:** “Just get a legacy.”
