## Stock & Markets Analysis

### 1. Market & Macro Overview
The market exhibits a classic "Reflexive Boom" resilience, rebounding sharply (Dow +1,000 pts) after a tech/crypto selloff (WSJ Markets #1). While "Cautionary" signals flash around rising Treasury yields (Barron's #16) and massive AI CapEx bills, the "buy the dip" mentality remains dominant, particularly in semiconductor and crypto-adjacent assets (MSTR +23%, NVDA +7%). The divergence between "spenders" (AMZN -6%) and "beneficiaries" (NVDA) is the defining narrative.

### 2. AI Ecosystem Positioning (Sector-Specific)
*   **The Reflexive Loop:** The loop is under stress but holding. Hyperscalers (AMZN, GOOGL) are confirming the "Capital Spending" phase ($200B+ forecasts), but their stock prices are suffering for it (Barron's #44, Reddit r/stocks #1).
*   **Compute & Infrastructure (Layers 1-3):** The "Supplier" preference is validated. The market punishes the *buyer* of chips (AMZN) while rewarding the *seller* (NVDA). The $610B combined CapEx estimate (Reddit r/ValueInvesting #5) confirms the "Execution Year" thesis, but power/cooling constraints remain the physical bottleneck.
*   **Applications (Layer 8):** The "SaaS-pocalypse" narrative (International Intrigue) suggests a fear that AI models will replace traditional enterprise software, pressuring stocks like Salesforce or Adobe, though specific price action here is secondary to the hardware story today.

### 3. Applied Investment Flags (General)
*   **Economic Reality vs. GAAP:** **Stellantis (STLA)** took a massive EV write-down, acknowledging that previous book values for EV assets did not reflect economic reality (Barron's #46). This "Big Bath" accounting clears the decks but signals a "Permanent Structural Impairment" in their EV strategy.
*   **Corporate Culture/Accounting:** **Hub Group (HUBG)** falling 25% on an "Accounting Error" (Barron's #11) is a critical red flag. Accounting errors are rarely isolated; they often signal weak internal controls or a culture of aggressive recognition.
*   **Mispricing vs. Impairment:** **Amazon (AMZN)** is down ~6% and flat/down over longer periods despite growing revenues (Reddit r/ValueInvesting #1). The market is pricing in "Capital Destruction" via AI spend. If the AI spend yields returns, this is a mispricing. If it's a "subsidy" that never converts to profit, the skepticism is warranted.
*   **Reflexivity:** **MicroStrategy (MSTR)** (+23%) continues to act as a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin, with price action decoupled from traditional operating metrics. The "crash" yesterday and "boom" today highlights the extreme volatility of this reflexive vehicle (WSJ Markets #5).

### 4. Screening Candidates

*   **Ticker/Theme:** **Stellantis (STLA)**
    *   **The Signal:** Daily Losers (-24.59%), Barron's #46 "Stellantis Stock Drops 28% After Massive EV Write-Down."
    *   **What News Says:** Billions in EV-related charges, no dividend, massive write-down of assets.
    *   **The Why:** A 25%+ drop on "write-downs" often presents a value opportunity if the core business remains sound ("Big Bath" theory), or it signals a value trap.
    *   **Investigation Items:**
        *   Verify the nature of the write-down: Is it inventory, PP&E, or intangibles?
        *   Check Cash Flow vs. Reported Loss.
    *   **Data Gap:** Does the core ICE business generate enough cash to support the pivot without the dividend?

*   **Ticker/Theme:** **Hub Group (HUBG)**
    *   **The Signal:** Daily Losers (-18.36%), Barron's #11 "Skidded 25% on an Accounting Error."
    *   **What News Says:** Stock fell due to an accounting error.
    *   **The Why:** Accounting errors are specific "Red Flags" in the Guidelines ("Expense manipulation signals").
    *   **Investigation Items:**
        *   Specific nature of the error (Revenue Rec vs. Expense).
        *   Management history/turnover.
    *   **Data Gap:** Full restatement details not yet analyzed.

*   **Ticker/Theme:** **Amazon (AMZN)**
    *   **The Signal:** Reddit r/ValueInvesting #1 ("AMZN is down almost 20% YOY"), Barron's #44 ("Amazon Isn’t Afraid to Spend").
    *   **What News Says:** Spending $200B+ on CapEx. Revenue up 13.6% but stock down due to spending fears.
    *   **The Why:** Classic "Time Arbitrage" opportunity. Market hates the spend *now*; if the spend creates a moat *later*, it's a buy.
    *   **Investigation Items:**
        *   AWS margins: Are they compressing due to AI costs?
        *   Cash Flow impacts of the $200B spend.
    *   **Data Gap:** Clarity on the "Revenue" generation from this specific AI spend (Layer 8 conversion).

*   **Ticker/Theme:** **Micron (MU)**
    *   **The Signal:** Reddit r/stocks #14 ("AMZN & GOOG Capex will make Micron moon"), Barron's #17.
    *   **What News Says:** Massive CapEx from hyperscalers requires memory. Micron stock has quadrupled but analysts expect more.
    *   **The Why:** Second-order derivative of the CapEx boom. If NVDA is crowded, MU might be the lag trade.
    *   **Investigation Items:**
        *   Inventory levels and pricing power in DRAM/HBM.
    *   **Data Gap:** Specific HBM market share vs. SK Hynix.

# 🌍 The geopolitics of the Winter Games

Plus: Kenya just banned this Valentine's gift

Feb 6, 2026

**Today’s briefing:**  
— The geopolitics of the Winter Games  
— Tequila intrigue in Mexico  
— Kenya just banned this Valentine’s gift

**Good morning {{first_name | Intriguer}}**. Please allow me to get sentimental for a sec. If there ever is a good reminder of our common humanity, surely it’s through sport. And for me, there’s no other global event more heartwarming than the Olympic Games.   
  
I’ve been an Olympics nerd since _Cool Runnings_ and absolutely love the spectacle of it all. From the torch relay celebs to the opening ceremonies, and all the geopolitical grudges played out on the podiums, there’s certainly no shortage of entertainment value (or armchair experts / commentators of niche Olympics sports) at each games.  
  
Today’s top story looks at the **Milan Winter Olympics** , which officially kicks off this evening. Whatever your views might be of the games, it’s at least a good distraction from the rest of the 2026 world events.

### Word of the day

**‘SaaS-pocalypse’**

That’s what they’re calling a sudden $300B SaaS market wipe-out, seemingly sparked by yet another Anthropic AI plug-in capable of replacing pricey enterprise software. 

### **Game of geopolitics**

Italy’s Winter Olympics opening ceremony kicks off in just a few hours, meaning we’ll soon burn our evenings watching snowboarders called ‘Tanner’ and ‘Yui’ pull sick Frontside Double Cork 1080 Lien-to-Melon Reverts.

But it also means that, as with any event bringing the world together, geopolitics is now in the air (doing a sick Frontside 720 Stale-Tail-to-Nosebone Re-entry).

Canada’s crack team of curlers has barely started buffing the ice yet, but you could already explore (say) the way Italy beat Sweden for the hosting rights, or how Russia has waged cyber attacks over its ban, or the continued protests against (and security for) Israel’s team, or [the big ICE furore](<https://www.internationalintrigue.io/how-ice-extends-beyond-the-us-2/>) we examined last month.

So while we watch for the first stadium protest, here are **five times geopolitics gatecrashed the Winter Games** , starting with…****

  1. **The ex-Olympian turned kingpin**




Former Olympians usually have **three retirement options** : become a coach, become a commentator, or become a spokesperson for Samsung. 

But Canada’s Ryan Wedding, who came 24th in the 2002 Parallel Giant Slalom snowboard, dedicated himself to a different kind of powder, accumulating drug charges until finally breaking into the FBI’s ‘Ten Most Wanted’ list last year (at least better than 24th?). 

Wedding handed himself in at the US embassy in Mexico City last month after years reportedly living under the protection of the famed Sinaloa cartel. These sudden surrenders tend to suggest someone’s now fearing the cartel more than prison. 

  2. **The four-day curse**




Russia has a murky Olympic record, and we’re not just talking about Putin’s state-sponsored doping scandal. Rather, we’re talking about how on two occasions he’s launched **new wars against Ukraine** exactly four days after the closing ceremony: 

  * The first was in **2014** , when he countered the popular ousting of his puppet in Ukraine by seizing Crimea. Why wait until after the Olympics? Putin was host. 

  * Ditto in China’s **2022** host year, when US intelligence suggests President Xi asked Putin not to invade Ukraine until after the games. Bad for business.




  3. **That time the Koreas were one**




You might recall South Korea’s 2018 games when North and South paraded together under **a unified Korea banner**. That flag made its first official appearance back at the 1991 World Table Tennis Championships in Japan — a reminder of sport’s long history as a forum for reconciliation. The two Koreas even fielded a joint 2018 ice hockey team, which scored more standing ovations than goals. 

But why’d the autocratic North suddenly show openness to this kind of unity?

  * The early 1990s reflected **isolation** after the collapse of the USSR, while…

  * 2018 reflected **confidence** after Kim declared his credible nuclear deterrent.




  4. **Citizenship drama on the slopes**




Athletes switch citizenship for **all kinds of reasons** : maybe your grandma’s birthplace has better facilities, or pays more, or has better qualifying chances, or isn’t banned.

There are a dozen or so athletes doing it for these Winter Games, and most go under the radar, like the Kiwi skier switching to the famously alpine nation of United Arab Emirates. But every now and then, a switch goes viral, like freestyle prodigy **Eileen Gu**. Why?

  * At the time (2019) she had just won the world cup

  * That rising star meant more cash and hype

  * It came just as Trump 1.0 was taking a more assertive stance on China, and

  * There was mystery whether she renounced her US citizenship per China’s rules.




That mix of fame, mystery, and geopolitics thrust Gu onto centre stage. 

  5. **Boycotts**




It’s almost boycott schmoycott these days: Western countries boycotted China’s 2022 games over Xinjiang, and Georgia tried boycotting Russia’s 2014 games over South Ossetia. But here’s another example you might not recall because you weren’t born.

Back in **1980** , the Olympic Committee forced **Taiwan** to participate under a new ‘Chinese Taipei’ name to make way for mainland China’s first Winter Olympic stint since the communist takeover of 1949. But when eight Taiwanese athletes then arrived at America’s Lake Placid Olympic Village, organisers denied them entry over their ‘Republic of China’ ID.

After finding a hotel room elsewhere, the athletes ended up boycotting the Games. 

#### Intrigue’s Take

The Olympic Committee loves to pretend sport is some neutral, transcendental platform reserved for slow-motion, synth-backed feats of humanity. But no amount of slow-motion or synth can scrub the politics, and the Committee knows this. It is, after all, the same body that awarded actual Nazis the hosting rights for the (eventually cancelled) 1940 Winter Games, _after_ Hitler had annexed Austria and taken Czechoslovakia.

Sure, sometimes politics might warm the cockles (whatever a cockle is) of your heart, like two Koreas united. Others might leave you with chills, like Putin spending the GDP of Tunisia on history’s most expensive games to burnish his image before his next invasion.

Anyway, for the wild world that is 2026, here’s hoping we see more warmth, less chills. And in the meantime, please enjoy Tanner’s sick Backside Triple Cork 1440 Crossbone.

### Meanwhile, elsewhere…

🇮🇷**IRAN — Leaving ahead of talks.**  
DC has (again) issued a notice urging US citizens to ‘leave Iran now’ ahead of today’s planned US-Iran talks in Oman. President Trump wants Iran to pause its nuclear program, limit its ballistic missile program, and stop funding proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis, conditions the mullahs have previously rejected. ([CNBC](<https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/us-asks-american-citizens-to-leave-iran-now-ahead-of-high-stakes-talks-with-tehran-.html>))

**Comment** : _DC issued a similar warning when Trump was publicly weighing up strikes last month._

🇷🇺**RUSSIA — General shot.**  
An unknown assailant has shot yet another senior Russian general in Moscow. This one (Alekseyev) is deputy head of Russia’s military intelligence. We say ‘is’ because he’s been rushed to hospital and his current status is unclear. ([Reuters](<https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-military-official-hospitalised-after-being-shot-agencies-report-2026-02-06/>))

**_Comment:_**_Whodunnit? The obvious suspect is Ukraine’s own intelligence services, which have a proven record of hitting these guys in the middle of Moscow. To boot, Alekseyev was one of the invasion’s key architects. But he was also famously tight with Prigozhin (of Wagner mutiny fame), so his enemies go beyond Ukraine._

🇵🇰**PAKISTAN — We’re done here.**  
Pakistan’s military says it’s now ended its week-long operation against Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) separatists, with hundreds reported dead. The push across Pakistan’s resource-rich region came in response to coordinated BLA attacks on schools, banks, markets and military sites. ([Al Jazeera](<https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/5/pakistan-army-says-it-killed-216-fighters-in-weeklong-balochistan-campaign>))

**_Comment:_**_Pakistan continues to accuse neighbouring India and Afghanistan of backing the Balochs, claims Delhi and Kabul deny. We explored this volatile situation_ _[here](<https://www.internationalintrigue.io/pakistan-and-afghanistan-are-taking-up-arms/>)_ _._

🇺🇸 **UNITED STATES — Re-opening of channels.**  
The US and Russia have agreed to re-establish senior military-to-military contact, frozen since Moscow's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. ([Bloomberg](<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/us-and-russia-agree-to-restart-military-to-military-talks>) $)

**_Comment:_**_The US-Russia New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START)__[expired](<https://www.internationalintrigue.io/the-last-us-russia-nuclear-pact-ends-tomorrow/>)_ _yesterday (Thursday), so there’s probably a premium on any crisis phone right now. But it’s arguably also another US concession without anything in return._

🇰🇭 **CAMBODIA** **— Your records, our evidence.**  
Cambodia has asked France to provide historical documents and advisory support to help resolve its border dispute with Thailand, citing France’s 1907 role in mapping the frontier during the country's colonial era. ([The Straits Times](<https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/cambodia-asks-france-to-provide-historical-evidence-to-help-settle-thai-border-dispute>))

**_Comment:_**_Thailand managed to seize quite a bit of disputed land during last year’s spat, and it’s hard to see it returning an inch, historical evidence or not._

🇲🇽**MEXICO — ¡Shots! ¡Shots! ¡Shots!**  
Authorities have arrested the mayor of Tequila (yes, it is a town) and three senior city officials for allegedly extorting tequila distilleries. It’s part of a federal anti-corruption crackdown targeting municipal officials accused of cartel links. ([NYT](<https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/world/americas/mexico-tequila-mayor-arrested.html>) $)

**_Comment:_**_The last time one of Mexico’s ~2,500 mayors hit the headlines, it was because one (in Uruapan) took a brave stand against organised crime and was assassinated for his troubles. So there’s a book-end feel to this._

🇲🇦**MOROCCO — Proceed with caution.**  
The Moroccan military has evacuated more than 140,000 people from the country’s northwest amid heavy rain, dam overflows, and flooding. It’s all broken seven years of drought, but the exceptional scale is disrupting everything from universities to maritime traffic with Spain. ([ABC News](<https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/morocco-evacuates-140000-people-torrential-rains-dam-releases-129889549>))

### Extra Intrigue

**Three stories we couldn’t shoehorn in this week** 🥾

  * **Read:** Spain’s prime ministerial op-ed in The New York Times on why he’s bucking the regional trend and [welcoming more migrants](<https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/04/opinion/spain-migrants-europe.html?smid=tw-share>). 

  * **Analyse:** How geopolitical bets have [surged across online prediction markets](<https://restofworld.org/2026/polymarket-online-betting-politics-war-charts/>).

  * **Learn:** About ‘Konglish’, the [random English words](<https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/southkorea/20260206/in-korea-riding-doesnt-mean-riding>) taking on new meanings in everyday Korean vocabulary. 




### Bouquet of the day

Credits: Fresh Flowers in Nairobi Kenya

**With Valentine’s Day just around the corner** , why not get your loved one a [*_checks notes_ *] decoratively arranged pile of cash.

Why not, dear Intriguer? Because Kenya’s central bank says so! The popular practice apparently creates a headache, with glued and stapled banknotes clogging up ATMs.

Still not deterred? The bank is even warning you could get seven years in jail! So to quote 20th century philosopher Meatloaf, we would do anything for love, but we won’t do that.
