### 1. NSF launches $100M quantum, nanotech network
_February 14, 2026 at 05:39 PM_
**Articles:** 6 unique / 8 total | **Topics:** Nanotechnology | **Companies:** National Science Foundation

On Feb. 13, 2026 the National Science Foundation announced a $100 million National Quantum and Nanotechnology Infrastructure (NQNI) program to create up to 16 open‑access quantum and nanoscale research sites over five years, providing shared fabrication and characterization tools, workforce training, and regional support for community colleges, researchers, and small businesses. Individual sites are expected to receive $500,000–$2,000,000 per year, letters of intent are due March 16, 2026 (full proposals due May 14, 2026), and NSF will later select a Coordinating Office to standardize expertise and accelerate commercialization.

**Key Points:**
- NSF will evaluate proposals based on sites’ technical capabilities and instrumentation to “address current and anticipated user needs,” and will consider plans for opening facilities and instrumentation for external use, education, training, outreach, and workforce development when selecting NQNI sites.
- Don Millard, head of Engineering at NSF, said: “This NSF investment in research facilities will power U.S. discovery in quantum and nanotechnologies to fuel our economy. With facilities open to students, faculty and small businesses, NQNI will enable transformative ideas to be explored, scaled, and translated.”
- NSF frames the NQNI investment as aligned with the National Quantum Initiative (NQI) Act and broader federal priorities to secure U.S. leadership in critical technologies.
- The announcement highlights specific advanced instrumentation the network will provide access to, citing examples such as advanced lithography, cryogenic characterization, and cleanroom facilities that smaller institutions often cannot afford on their own.

### 2. Enbridge posts record 2025 core earnings
_February 14, 2026 at 05:37 PM_
**Articles:** 34 unique / 73 total | **Topics:** Markets | **Companies:** Enbridge Inc. CUM RED PFD 19, Enbridge Inc., Tesla, Inc., DCP Midstream, LP, Meta

Enbridge posted record 2025 results—including full-year EBITDA of about US$14.7 billion and a Q4 profit near $1.95 billion with adjusted Q4 EPS around C$0.88 that topped estimates and helped push the stock to a record high. The company is advancing a C$39 billion project backlog and has sanctioned capacity-adding projects (notably the Mainline Optimization Phase 1 adding ~150,000 bpd) while expanding natural-gas takeaway and data‑center power links that could require up to 10 Bcf/d of new capacity, supporting firmer crude and gas market dynamics.

**Key Points:**
- Enbridge’s reported Q4 profit jumped to $1.95 billion from $493 million a year earlier; earnings attributable to common shareholders rose to $0.89 per share (from $0.23), and adjusted Q4 EPS climbed to $0.88 from $0.75. For the full year, Enbridge reported $7.1 billion in earnings versus $5.1 billion in 2024.
- The Mainline Optimization Phase 1 project is expected to enter service in 2027 and includes a 100,000-barrel-per-day expansion of the Flanagan South pipeline to provide full-path service to the U.S. Gulf Coast.
- Enbridge is building on a partnership with Meta in the power space as part of its broader efforts to support data centers and power-generation projects.
- The Eiger Express pipeline was upsized in November, a move driven by growing demand for Permian natural gas egress capacity.

### 3. Wisconsin routs No. 10 Michigan State 92-71
_February 14, 2026 at 04:25 PM_
**Articles:** 18 unique / 211 total | **Companies:** UCLA, Medicine Hat News, University of Southern California, Michigan State University, Getty Images Holdings, Inc.

Wisconsin routed No. 10 Michigan State 92-71 in Madison, paced by Nick Boyd’s 29 points and John Blackwell’s 24 as the Badgers drilled 15 three-pointers and led by as many as 24 points. The win — Wisconsin’s third over a top-10 opponent this season and its largest margin against an AP Top-10 team — moved the Badgers to 18-7 (10-4 Big Ten).

**Key Points:**
- Wisconsin's 21-point victory was the largest margin against a top-10 team in the AP Poll era (since 1948-49); the Badgers' only other 20-point win over a top-10 opponent came on Feb. 18, 1989, vs. No. 5 Illinois (72-52).
- Spartans center Carson Cooper landed awkwardly on a drive, briefly left the game, and Wisconsin outscored Michigan State 8-0 while he was out — part of a 15-0 run that helped expand the lead to 32-14 when Cooper returned.
- The Badgers scored their most points against Michigan State since 1975.
- Wisconsin’s statistical edges included 19 second-chance points, a +21 advantage in points off three-pointers, and a +14 margin in both points in the paint and points off turnovers; Michigan State’s lone notable edge was a +14 advantage in fast-break points.

The up-to-1.5 million sq ft facility will focus on high-performance computing, process-control engineering software and AI-driven semiconductor innovation, a development Tamil Nadu leaders say strengthens the state’s semiconductor ecosystem and reflects confidence in its governance and talent pool.

**Key Points:**
- The MoU signing was attended by several senior officials including Deputy Chief Minister Udhayanidhi Stalin, Industries Minister T.R.B. Rajaa, Chief Secretary N. Muruganandam, Industry Secretary Arun Roy, and Bobby Bell, EVP and Head of Government Relations, KLA.
- KLA said the investment commitment is 'up to $400 million' to be made over the next decade, underscoring the long-term timeline for the project.
- Tamil Nadu Industries Minister T. R. B. Rajaa posted that 'KLA which is one of the BIG 3 in Semiconductor manufacturing design and R&D' and added, 'From electronics manufacturing to semiconductor R&D, we are moving up the value chain !' in announcing the deal.
- KLA already has existing operations in Chennai, and the new campus is described as building on decades of growth in the region and intended to serve as KLA’s flagship innovation hub in Chennai.

### 5. Intel expands XeSS Frame Generation to Arc GPUs
_February 14, 2026 at 03:20 PM_
**Articles:** 5 unique / 5 total | **Companies:** Intel Corporation, Google

Intel released WHQL-certified graphics driver v32.0.101.8509, expanding XeSS 3 Multi‑Frame Generation from Panther Lake to nearly all Arc GPUs — including Arc Battlemage and Alchemist dGPUs and Arc iGPUs in Core Ultra (Meteor Lake, Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake H) — allowing insertion of up to three AI‑generated frames between rendered frames to boost FPS and smoothness. The update (Windows 10 22H2+/11) can multiply framerates (users report up to ~3–4×) but may add input lag at the highest modes and Intel’s release notes list several game-specific crashes and visual-corruption issues.

**Key Points:**
- Intel's XeSS stack is split into multiple features — XeSS 2 includes Super Resolution, Frame Generation and Xe Low Latency — and Intel notes that XeSS Frame Generation requires Xe Low Latency to be enabled.
- Before this official driver, some users forced Multi-Frame Generation on older Battlemage/Alchemist GPUs via workarounds such as copying DLLs between driver folders; the new WHQL driver removes the need for those mods.
- Intel and some outlets emphasize that no other GPU vendor has delivered multi-frame generation across multiple generations of integrated GPUs — Intel calls out support across three generations of Arc integrated graphics as unique.
- Published examples suggest large, game-dependent gains — one write-up gives a concrete example that a 65 FPS run could be pushed to roughly 220–250 FPS with XeSS 3 MFG enabled (depending on title), illustrating the potential ~3–4x uplift in frame output.

### 6. PJM extends price cap to 2030, covers 67M
_February 14, 2026 at 03:09 PM_
**Articles:** 14 unique / 34 total | **Companies:** Yahoo Inc., Baltimore Gas and Electric

PJM Interconnection agreed to extend a $325/MW-day wholesale capacity price cap through 2030, a move Govs. Josh Shapiro and Wes Moore say will save the grid’s 67 million customers about $27 billion more (roughly $45 billion total) in energy costs. Critics counter the artificial cap could blunt incentives to build new gas-fired generation and raise reliability and blackout risks as demand grows.

**Key Points:**
- Maryland Gov. Wes Moore has taken several specific steps beyond supporting the cap extension: he signed an executive order to close a projected generation gap, introduced the Lower Bills and Local Power Act (nearly $200 million in rebates and grid upgrade support), built on the Next Generation Energy Act (authorizing $200 million in ratepayer relief), and state regulators announced new discounted rates for low‑income customers to take effect by 2027.
- Gov. Josh Shapiro sued PJM in December 2024; a January 2025 settlement (later approved by federal regulators) initially capped bids at $325/MW‑day for the 2025 and 2026 auctions after a July auction hit a record $269.92/MW‑day.
- Pennsylvania officials say the extension translates to roughly $575 in savings for every Pennsylvania household over the next four years.
- PJM’s board said its decision reflected feedback not only from state governors and stakeholders but also from the Trump administration.

_February 14, 2026 at 01:20 PM_
**Articles:** 5 unique / 6 total | **Topics:** Style, Sports Figures, NASCAR | **Companies:** NASCAR, NBA, Toyota Motor Corporation, NIKE, Inc.

At Daytona 500 weekend, Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin’s 23XI Racing debuted an exclusive Air Jordan 9 “Pit Shoe” — a triple-black, red-accented PE worn by pit crew members that meets NASCAR safety specs (SFI 3.3/5, oil‑resistant high‑grip soles) and is not expected to be released publicly. Fresh off a lawsuit settlement with NASCAR that secured greater protections and revenue, 23XI heads into the 2026 season as a top contender with drivers Tyler Reddick, Bubba Wallace and Riley Herbst pushing for a championship.

**Key Points:**
- The original Air Jordan 9 silhouette was designed by Tinker Hatfield and first released in 1993–94 — the AJ9 PE for 23XI is an iteration of that classic design.
- Michael Jordan co-founded 23XI Racing with driver Denny Hamlin in 2020; the team name combines Jordan’s No. 23 with Hamlin’s No. 11, and the organization has since expanded to multiple full-time entries, earned historic wins (including Bubba Wallace’s early win), and built a facility in North Carolina.
- Sneaker coverage notes a grey sockliner and a stitched globe on the spine (rather than TPU), and draws an aesthetic comparison between this PE and the original Air Jordan 9 “Charcoal.”
- This Air Jordan 9 PE appeared just weeks after Tyler Reddick was seen wearing a snakeskin Jordan 4 PE, underscoring a recent string of team/driver PE appearances tied to 23XI and its drivers.

**Articles:** 5 unique / 19 total | **Topics:** Baseball, Basketball | **Companies:** Detroit Lions, Michigan State University, The Courier-Journal, UCLA

Michigan State opened the 2026 season with a 4-3 road upset of No. 8 Louisville, keyed by Randy Seymour’s eighth-inning home run and three RBIs while Nolan Higgins took the win and Tommy Szczepanski recorded the save as Adam Broski scored the go-ahead run. Photo galleries from Jim Patterson Stadium captured the late-game plays and celebrations as the two teams prepare to finish the three-game series.

**Key Points:**
- Louisville reliever Casen Murphy allowed two runs on two hits and struck out four batters over two innings in relief during the season opener.
- The game photo gallery (credited to Jeff Faughender/Courier Journal/USA TODAY Network) captured specific plays such as Louisville outfielder Lucas Moore stealing second base and Tommy Szczepanski celebrating after the final out.
- Wisconsin dominated the interior game and the offensive glass, outscoring Michigan State 28-14 in the paint and 19-8 on second-chance points; MSU managed just four points in the paint in the first half (halftime 51-34).
- Nick Boyd heated up early, hitting four 3-pointers in the first half and finishing with 29 points on 17 shots as he effectively outdueled Jeremy Fears Jr.

**Articles:** 10 unique / 12 total | **Topics:** Lawsuits, Social Issues, NAACP | **Companies:** The Commercial Appeal, Duke Energy Corporation, United States Environmental Protection Agency, Federal Register, SpaceX

The Southern Environmental Law Center and Earthjustice, on behalf of the NAACP, issued a 60-day notice of intent to sue xAI and its affiliate over alleged Clean Air Act violations, saying dozens of unpermitted natural-gas “mobile‑temporary” turbines powering the Colossus 2 data center in Southaven/Memphis are operating without required permits and harming nearby communities. Advocates point to 27 methane-fueled turbines that emit nitrogen oxides and other pollutants worsening smog and health risks, while Mississippi regulators have at times treated such units as temporary and xAI is reportedly applying for permanent air permits as it expands its data‑center footprint.

**Key Points:**
- xAI recently merged with SpaceX; Elon Musk said the deal (announced Feb. 2) valued the combined entity at $1.25 trillion.
- The temporary turbines at the Southaven site began operating as early as mid‑August at a former Duke Energy power‑plant location; xAI initially deployed 18 units and later increased the count to 27.
- Advocates argue the installations have large, utility‑scale capacity — the turbines are capable of generating about 495 megawatts — and reportedly emit hazardous chemicals including formaldehyde in addition to nitrogen oxides.
- NAACP environmental‑justice director Abre’ Conner said, “Our communities are not playgrounds for corporations who are chasing profit over people,” framing the dispute as one of corporate profit versus community health.

### 10. Pentagon Briefly Publishes, Withdraws China Firms List
_February 14, 2026 at 11:05 AM_
**Articles:** 28 unique / 61 total | **Companies:** Alibaba Group Holding Limited, Reuters, Xiaomi Corporation, Tencent Holdings Limited, BOE Technology Group Company Limited

The U.S. Pentagon added major Chinese firms — including Alibaba, Baidu, BYD and RoboSense — to its Section 1260H list alleging links to China’s military, a designation that doesn’t immediately impose sanctions but can bar future Defense Department contracting and serve as a warning to investors; Alibaba denied the claim and said it may pursue legal action. The update, which pushed down U.S. ADRs for some firms, risks raising tensions ahead of President Trump’s planned April visit to China and could complicate trade and technology talks, including potential chip export discussions.

**Key Points:**
- The list was compiled and signed out by Deputy Defense Secretary Steve (Stephen) Feinberg — officials said he listed companies based on links to Chinese ministries, the PLA and the military‑civil fusion program.
- The briefly posted roster included brief explanations for each firm’s alleged ties to China’s military or intelligence services rather than just a bare list of names.
- The update kept major firms already on prior lists — notably Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC) — and also included state entities such as Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China Ltd. and China COSCO Shipping Corp.
- Market reaction was sharp: Alibaba American depositary receipts fell as much as about 5% in extended trading and Baidu ADRs declined roughly 4.5% after the announcement.

**Articles:** 5 unique / 6 total | **Topics:** Russia-Ukraine War | **Companies:** Harvard Business School, SpaceX, Deloitte, XLAB d.o.o, NVIDIA Corporation

Space Forge, a Cardiff-based startup, launched its microwave-sized ForgeStar-1 satellite in June 2025 to demonstrate microgravity manufacturing — generating plasma — as a step toward producing ultra-high-purity crystal “seeds” in orbit that the company says could be hundreds to thousands of times purer than terrestrial equivalents and boost performance for quantum computers, AI data centers, defense and telecoms. The firm plans a commercial orbital production system within roughly two years but faces regulatory, legal and commercialization hurdles even as it targets high-performance aerospace, defense, telecommunications and data-center markets.

**Key Points:**
- ForgeStar-1 was launched into orbit aboard a SpaceX rocket.
- Obtaining the launch licence for ForgeStar-1 took two and a half years, even though the satellite itself was built in just seven weeks.
- Space Forge is based in Cardiff, Wales — the company’s development and leadership operate out of that UK hub.
- CEO Joshua Western said regulation has been the biggest challenge, noting: 'We’re a business that’s trying to do something that doesn’t yet exist.'

_February 14, 2026 at 07:38 AM_
**Articles:** 8 unique / 10 total | **Topics:** AI | **Companies:** Cipher Mining Inc., NVIDIA Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Meta, Google

Nvidia will lease a 200‑megawatt data center in Storey County, Nevada being developed by Tract Capital’s Fleet (Fleet I), financed largely by a $3.8 billion junk‑bond sale that was increased by $150 million and is targeting roughly a 6% yield, with Fleet I expected to contribute about $620 million of equity and JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley leading the offering. The initial lease runs 16 years with two optional 10‑year extensions, and the deal underscores a broader surge in high‑yield borrowing to fund AI infrastructure amid local legal disputes over competing data‑center development.

**Key Points:**
- Fleet Data Centers was launched in January 2026 with an explicit goal of developing “mega-scale” single-user campuses of 500 MW and above and said it would start with up to 3 GW of development in North America.
- Tract Capital was founded by former Cologix CEO Grant van Rooyen.
- Tract Capital has acquired more than 11,000 acres of land in Storey County, Nevada for its developments.
- A 2025 court ruling clarified that the Switch covenant does not restrict single‑tenant, wholesale or dedicated cloud facilities — a legal development that bears on competing data‑centre projects in the area.

### 13. Top prospects shake up 2026 draft
_February 14, 2026 at 06:24 AM_
**Articles:** 5 unique / 6 total | **Topics:** Basketball, NBA | **Companies:** NBA, ESPN Inc., The Athletic, UCLA, RotoWire

Updated 2026 draft evaluations keep Kansas guard Darryn Peterson near the top despite lingering leg issues, with BYU’s AJ Dybantsa and Duke’s Cameron Boozer filling out an elite top three and breakout performances (like Keaton Wagler’s surge) highlighting an unexpectedly deep class.  Meanwhile, ESPN’s Big Board slots Wisconsin’s John Blackwell and Nolan Winter in the mid‑60s — effectively borderline for a two‑round draft — and college injury and DFS coverage (notably Peterson’s and North Carolina’s Caleb Wilson’s recent health news) underscore how medicals and late‑season play will shape draft stock and lineup decisions.

**Key Points:**
- Kansas guard Darryn Peterson has missed 11 games this season with a variety of issues (including hamstring problems and cramping) but, when available, has averaged about 20.5 points, making availability the primary medical concern for teams.
- Illinois freshman Keaton Wagler vaulted from No. 25 to No. 6 on updated boards after an explosive 46-point game against Purdue.
- BYU’s AJ Dybantsa has emerged as a dominant interior scorer — listed at 6-foot-9 — averaging roughly 24.5 points on an outstanding 58.6% shooting clip, though scouts still cite ball-handling and defensive consistency as areas for improvement.
- Duke’s Cameron Boozer has been piling up double-doubles and is drawing stylistic comparisons to Domantas Sabonis for his polished offensive skill set.

**Articles:** 7 unique / 24 total | **Topics:** AI | **Companies:** Reuters, Apple Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, NVIDIA Corporation, Taiwan News

Taiwan’s statistics office sharply raised its 2026 GDP forecast to 7.71% (up from 3.54%), citing robust global demand for AI-related products and eased tariff uncertainties after 2025 growth of about 8.68% and a Q4 print near 12.65%. The outlook is echoed in investor optimism—analysts have lifted price targets on chipmaker TSMC—and rising semiconductor and ICT exports (including stronger trade with Thailand) that underscore Taiwan’s central role in the global AI supply chain.

**Key Points:**
- The DGBAS gave specific upward revisions for investment: private investment is now forecast to grow 4.24% in 2026 (up 2.51 percentage points from the prior estimate) and fixed capital formation is forecast to grow 4.08% (up 1.91 percentage points).
- In Q4 2025 exports of goods and services surged 38.81% year‑on‑year while imports rose 24.59%; gross capital formation fell 3.39% as construction and transport equipment investment contracted, and on a quarter‑on‑quarter seasonally adjusted annualised basis GDP rose 23.55%.
- Wall Street analysts have become more bullish on TSMC: Barclays raised its price target to $450 (from $380) and kept an Overweight rating, while TD Cowen raised its target to $370 (from $325) and updated a 2026 growth outlook of roughly +30% year‑over‑year for the company.
- Bilateral trade with Thailand strengthened in 2025 to NT$608.8 billion (up 7.3%); Taiwan’s exports to Thailand were NT$401.7 billion (up 8.15%) and imports NT$207 billion (up 5.7%). Taiwanese firms also announced 131 investment projects in Thailand last year totaling NT$27.7 billion, with Taiwan’s representative in Thailand noting that “economic and trade cooperation now extends beyond commercial interests, as national security is increasingly tied to semiconductors, AI, and ICT.”

**Articles:** 6 unique / 11 total | **Topics:** Markets, Oil Sector, Energy Sector | **Companies:** EQT Corporation, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Viper Energy Partners LP, Cheniere Energy, Inc., Vistra Corp.

Energy stocks have surged into 2026 as oil prices remain elevated and market drivers — OPEC+ supply discipline, geopolitical risk, rising LNG exports and a spike in electricity demand from AI data centers — are prompting a rotation back into the sector.  Wall Street strategists and Goldman Sachs point to strong free cash flow, dividends and buybacks and are highlighting names from large, stable Canadian plays like Suncor and growth-oriented International Petroleum to U.S. picks such as ConocoPhillips, Kinder Morgan, Vistra and Cheniere as likely beneficiaries.

**Key Points:**
- Suncor reported record 2025 operations — Q4 production of 909,000 barrels per day (up from 875,000 a year earlier), record refinery throughput of 504,000 bpd with 108% utilization — and currently trades around $74 with a market cap of about $88 billion and a 3.2% dividend yield; the company has committed to returning 100% of excess funds and ramped its monthly buyback pace to $275 million in 2026.
- The International Energy Agency projects global data center electricity demand could more than double by 2030, and several utilities — including Dominion Energy, Duke Energy and Southern Company — have flagged connection requests from hyperscale data centers that dwarf historical planning models.
- The energy sector has rallied roughly 20% since the start of 2026 while the S&P 500 has been essentially flat year-to-date; Goldman Sachs attributed the strength to 'positive GDP revisions, a broader tech rotation as well as positive oil momentum amid smaller than expected surpluses and geopolitical uncertainty.'
- Cheniere Energy — the leading U.S. LNG exporter — is highlighted as positioned to benefit from both domestic AI-driven electricity demand and international gas needs; the article notes natural gas supplies about 43% of U.S. electricity generation and mentions Cheniere's 0.94% dividend and scalable export capabilities.

DayOne Data Centers, the Singapore-based unit spun out and rebranded from GDS Holdings, has tapped JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley (with Bank of America and Citigroup also involved) to prepare a U.S. IPO that could raise about $5 billion and target a valuation of up to $20 billion as soon as this year. The company—fresh off a more than $2 billion Series C—says proceeds would support hyperscale campus builds and expansion across Europe and Asia, including projects in Finland, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan and Hong Kong.

**Key Points:**
- Deal details are still fluid — DayOne’s bankers selection is not final, other banks could be added and the size and terms of the offering may change.
- Reporters noted concrete signs of recent U.S. market turbulence relevant to the timing of the IPO: the Nasdaq 100 fell about 4.6% and lost roughly US$1.5 trillion in market value over a ten-session stretch, and several planned listings (eg, Clear Street Group and AGI Inc) have been trimmed or postponed.
- DayOne did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment about the reported IPO plans.
- Observers pointed to heavy M&A activity in the region’s data‑centre sector as context for the IPO push — last week a KKR-led group agreed to buy STT GDC for S$6.6 billion (about US$5.2 billion).

**Articles:** 9 unique / 23 total | **Topics:** Startups | **Companies:** Sandia National Laboratory, Helion Energy, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), University of Michigan, University of Washington

Helion Energy said its Polaris prototype reached plasma temperatures of 150 million °C while operating with deuterium–tritium fuel—a rare private‑sector test the company frames as a major step (about 75% of the temperature it targets for a commercial reactor) that produced a measurable rise in fusion output. Helion, chaired by Sam Altman, says the milestone advances its plan to deliver electricity to the grid (under a Microsoft contract) with a 50 MW Orion plant by 2028 using a field‑reversed configuration and direct magnetic energy capture, but skeptics warn the timeline and scalability remain uncertain.

**Key Points:**
- Sam Altman is directly involved with Helion (described as chair in some reports) and Helion raised about $425 million last year from a consortium that included Sam Altman, Mithril, Lightspeed and SoftBank.
- Polaris uses a field‑reversed configuration in an hourglass‑shaped chamber: two compact plasmas form at opposite ends, are magnetically accelerated toward each other and rapidly compressed in a sequence that unfolds in under a millisecond — i.e., the device operates in very fast pulses rather than steady state.
- Helion says it is already building its 50 MW Orion commercial plant in Malaga (about 130 miles from Polaris) and is pursuing assembly‑line manufacturing in parallel, but the company cautions Orion’s reactor isn’t yet being assembled and still requires additional engineering and design fine‑tuning; CEO David Kirtley acknowledged the 2028 grid target is aggressive: “We’re on schedule to still have first electrons to the grid in 2028. It is an aggressive milestone. It’s going to be hard.”
- The broader private fusion funding backdrop cited alongside Helion’s news includes large recent rounds for peers — e.g., Inertia Enterprises’ $450 million Series A (led by Bessemer and GV), Type One Energy pursuing about $250 million, and Commonwealth Fusion Systems having raised roughly $863 million from investors including Google and Nvidia — underscoring strong investor momentum in the sector.

_February 13, 2026 at 02:47 PM_
**Articles:** 7 unique / 7 total | **Topics:** AI | **Companies:** NVIDIA Corporation, OpenAI, Amazon.com, Inc., McKinsey & Company, Google

NVIDIA has rolled out generative AI coding tools—a customized version of Cursor from Anysphere—to about 30,000 engineers, increasing code output by up to three times while reporting that bug rates have remained steady. CEO Jensen Huang has pressed for broad internal AI automation to boost productivity and speed product development, with company reports saying AI-assisted work has also aided features like DLSS and chip design.

**Key Points:**
- Reports say NVIDIA has also integrated OpenAI’s agentic coding tool Codex into daily development workflows alongside Cursor.
- Cursor stated in a February 6 blog that NVIDIA witnessed "fast, accurate results" because Cursor can "map out and semantically reason over large codebases," which the company credits for part of the speed gains.
- Wei Luo, NVIDIA’s VP of Engineering, said that before adopting Cursor the company used other internal and external AI coding tools, but "after adopting Cursor, that's when we really started seeing significant increases in development velocity."
- Senior software architect Fabian Theuring noted Cursor’s agent is "smarter, faster and more efficient" because it retrieves only the most relevant context when working with large codebases.

**Articles:** 6 unique / 6 total | **Companies:** Arm Holdings, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, Mission Advancement Corp., Free Malaysia Today

Pandan MP and former economy minister Rafizi Ramli says an internal MACC source warned him of a possible raid over allegations of misappropriation tied to a roughly RM1.1 billion government agreement with UK semiconductor firm Arm Holdings, which he denies as an intimidation tactic and says he’s prepared to face and fully cooperate with any probe. The complaint was lodged by NGOs and the Malaysian Anti‑Corruption Commission has said it will review the report to decide whether to open a formal investigation.

**Key Points:**
- Rafizi directly challenged Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim and MACC chief Tan Sri Azam Baki, saying he is a “veteran” of arrests, raids and lockups and daring authorities to act — telling MACC “do your worst” and that if they want to arrest or search him, they should do so.
- He made light-hearted remarks about preparing for a possible search — saying he told his wife to tidy the house and quipping that he had ensured “all my underwear is in order.”
- On X (formerly Twitter) Rafizi mocked the allegations, posting “Apparently, ARM bribed me. I didn’t even get lunch or souvenirs from ARM, let alone kickbacks,” and likened the episode to “The Empire Strikes Back.”
- A Bloomberg report cited in coverage alleges broader abuses within MACC, including claims that the commission conspired with business figures to coerce companies into the hands of certain individuals and that the MACC chief commissioner interfered in a police firearms case.

# 🌍 A week of espionage

Plus: Meme of the day

Feb 13, 2026

**Today’s briefing:**  
— A week of espionage  
— New dictator just dropped  
— Meme of the day

**Good morning {{first_name | Intriguer}}**. You know that Norman Rockwell painting meme where a regular guy stands up at a town meeting to voice his presumably unpopular opinion? This morning, I’m him: “ _the Winter Olympics are better than the Summer Olympics_ ”. Cue outraged murmuring among the townsfolk.

I like to imagine a casual conversation at the annual Olympian Christmas party: Oh you do the long jump? Me too! Except 100m through the air on very long, wobbly planks. You’re a crack shot at 50m? Oh what a coincidence, me too! Right in the middle of running a marathon on very skinny, wobbly planks.

And then there’s the skeleton, which... look, I don’t want to be grim, but if you’ve recently gotten some bad news from the doctor and are looking to go out on your own spectacular terms...

To top it all off, every single TV shot is framed by the spectacular Italian Alps. Motion unanimously passed, I think you’ll agree.

Now, with that out of the way, let’s get on to the fun stuff: a classic Friday Intrigue story involving communist **spies** , stolen NATO **secrets** , and a **CIA** tip-off.

### Name of the day

**Tarique Rahman**

That’s the likely next prime minister of Bangladesh (pop. 175m), after his centre-right party won a majority in yesterday’s elections. He’s no stranger to power: his mother was the country’s first female prime minister, and his father was assassinated while serving as president in 1981.

### **The spies among us.**

There’ve always been spies among us. That college friend who says they work at State but never posted their Flag Day snaps to LinkedIn? Suspicious. Or the neighbour who’s _really_ curious __ about what you do in that embassy all day? Interesting. 

Whether it’s King Zimri-Lin’s vast Mesopotamia spying network 3,800 years ago, or ✌️consultants✌️ pinging us on LinkedIn with too-good-to-be-true jobs today, espionage always makes for blockbuster material, and it’s been a busy week, starting with…

  1. **How they recruit**




The classic framework for why folks turn is ‘**MICE** ’: money, ideology, coercion, and/or ego.

For a **money** example, look no further than Germany, where it turns out the Kremlin only had to pay a few useful idiots €100 per vehicle to blow up 270+ exhaust pipes and make it look like the work of a hawkish party Moscow didn’t like, all while polarising Germany.

For **ideology** (with a bit of money and ego), look at what **the CIA** just did this week, dropping its latest Mandarin-language [YouTube video](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mCVjyXI-jM>) titled _“Save the Future”._

Aimed at disillusioned officers in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) amid President Xi’s [sweeping purges](<https://archives.internationalintrigue.io/p/reduced-size-template-60b5b5c5582f56a1?utm_source=archives.internationalintrigue.io&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=where-s-zhang-youxia&_bhlid=b0a151d197e236d5edc96cb57f4342127105009b&last_resource_guid=Post%3Ad142ac52-06f6-4f52-9bac-31ca301ee89c&jwt_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWJzY3JpYmVyX2lkIjoiMDcxNTVkODEtNjAyMS00MTZiLWE2OGEtMTA4ZDkxYzJkZTc0IiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiI4NzFhY2M4NS1jMjlkLTRiODMtYWI4OS05ODQwNWQyMjdmMGUiLCJhY2Nlc3NfdHlwZSI6InJlYWQtb25seSIsImV4cCI6MTc2OTY4MzY4OCwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcHAuYmVlaGlpdi5jb20iLCJpYXQiOjE3Njk0MjQ0ODh9.C_xPoVrDQLJ5tG-BFN7f_69PWRNrhFfnwKSwhd3oEBc>), it frames cooperation with the CIA not as a betrayal, but a way to "_take control of your own destiny_ " and protect your family from a corrupt system.

The curious thing about this campaign is how it’s almost **the inverse** of the CIA’s earlier big PLA drive when it plied ambitious officers with cash to help bribe their way up — rather than hunker down from — a corrupt system.

**Will it work this time?** CIA boss John Ratcliffe argued similar ads worked last year, but he’s going to declare success either way: the mere existence of an ad and victory lap is already enough to pour gasoline on Xi’s flaming paranoia, helping rattle China’s elites.

But while you can see how Xi’s aggressive purges might leave insiders more open to a CIA off-ramp, you can also see how the CIA’s last China ending (CIA sources getting rounded up and shot) would leave any insider locked shut. And yet… if you’re worried your own paranoid boss might purge you anyway, maybe you take another look at that off-ramp?

  2. **What they want**




[Estonia](<https://raport.valisluureamet.ee/2026/en/>) just dropped its **annual intelligence report** , offering a perfect example of how spooks prioritise: it dedicates _five of its seven_ chapters to Russia! And that makes sense when you recall Russia has attacked Estonia multiple times.

It also explains why Estonia’s intel has long had **cult followings** across the West: eg, Estonia’s legendary Russia analyst (and current ambassador to Israel) Andres Vosman just went viral with insights on the Kremlin, whether obsessively monitoring its own people, dreading the fallout from returning veterans, or deepening its own dependence on China.

The Estonian report also highlights that, yes, **friends spy on friends!** It gives the example of **North Korean** operatives actively gathering info across Russia and China, the regime’s closest (only?) partners. Why? The target cities (China’s Dalian and Shenyang, Russia’s Blagoveshchensk) are just over the border, suggesting a focus on:

  * **a**) managing and exploiting DPRK’s own worker diaspora, and

  * **b**) stealing nearby defence tech (the DPRK has science & tech ✌️attachés✌️ there).




Btw, speaking of stealing defence tech, Google just released [a grim report](<https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/threats-to-defense-industrial-base>) on how state-backed hackers are now targeting employees right across Western defence supply chains.

  3. **When they get caught**




As of this week, a 54-year-old squadron leader in the Greek air force is now in detention for allegedly **leaking NATO secrets to China**. Seems his handlers first pinged him on LinkedIn with a consulting opportunity, then met him in-person near a NATO summit.

The military bigwig then made an undeclared trip to China in 2024, where Beijing’s MSS seems to have sprung the trap — maybe of **the honey variety** , though it could just as easily be the mere threat of publishing pics of him secretly meeting MSS operatives.

Either way, he allegedly caved, did some training on how to send classified docs via an **encrypted device** , and started earning €5,000–15,000 per leak via a debit card linked to a Hong Kong-based payments provider. Greek intelligence seemingly got a CIA tip-off, and has made a surprising amount of detail public here, as has Paris this week in charging…

  * four guys for using a satellite dish at an **Airbnb** to intercept secrets for China, and

  * another for wearing **video-recording glasses** on a fighter jet assembly line in Cergy!




There’s sometimes leverage in managing these cases quietly, but all the publicity here suggests Western capitals are signalling for **a**) locals not to be stupid, and **b**) rivals to know there’ll be increasingly steep costs ahead.

#### Intrigue’s Take

We’ve barely scratched the surface of a single week here, dear Intriguer. We could’ve added Australian intelligence recruiting a foreign imam to infiltrate extremists in Sydney, or the Turks arresting two alleged spies for Israel, or the American who just got three years for trying to leak info to China from a base in Germany, or even the Canberra bakery assistant facing charges she was helping China’s communist party track a local diaspora.

But the point is it’s everywhere. And former French intel operative ‘Jack Beaumont’ once described to us what it’s like to have your eyes opened to that fact: it’s like how after going scuba diving for the first time, **you can never un-see** what’s beneath the waves.

Anyway, it’s only going to get more pervasive as our world gets more spooked. And while we all tell ourselves we’d never betray our country, anyone working in a sensitive area should remember there are entire teams out there with legit tech, tradecraft, and tenacity, whose literal only job is to test that assumption in every possible way.

### Meanwhile, elsewhere…

🇯🇵**JAPAN — Stop right there.**  
Japan’s fisheries agency has seized a China-based fishing vessel after it refused inspection and attempted to flee, with the 11 onboard now facing potential charges back in Nagasaki port. ([_NBC_](<https://www.nbcnews.com/world/asia/japan-seizes-chinese-fishing-boat-arrests-skipper-rcna258882>) _)_

**_Comment:_**_This one’s significant not so much for the location (absolutely within Japan’s EEZ), but the timing, coming just days after hawkish Sanae Takaichi won her historic (re)election: Beijing may well see it as Takaichi’s first move._

🇰🇵**NORTH KOREA — Nepo baby.**  
South Korean intelligence has told lawmakers the 13-year-old daughter of the North’s dictator (Kim) has now advanced to “ _successor-designate_ ” stage from her earlier “ _successor training_ ” status. (_[The Chosun Daily](<https://www.chosun.com/english/national-en/2026/02/12/PQAMWDKJPFCXDHDHGELH6LKLNQ/>)_ _)_

**_Comment:_**_We’ll soon get a sense how accurate this assessment is, because the North’s five-yearly Workers’ Party congress is scheduled for later this month — the young girl’s attendance, seating, and/or official mentions will all offer clues. Btw, the world first learned of her existence (and possible name) thanks to *that* visit by NBA star Dennis Rodman in 2013, when he reported holding her as a baby._

🇩🇪**GERMANY — Crucial conference.**  
The influential Munich Security Conference kicks off today (Friday), attracting ~record world leader attendance amid cascading crises. ([_Politico_](<https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/gop-munich-security-conference-shutdown-00779083>) _)_

**_Comment:_**_There’s speculation Marco Rubio might seek to stabilise transatlantic ties in his address tomorrow (Saturday) after last year’s JD Vance speech. But any hoped reassurance might now be undercut by the fact DC’s budget showdown means the biggest-ever congressional delegation to Munich is now cancelled (though some members will still attend on their own)._

🇺🇦 **UKRAINE — Olympic level drama.**  
President Zelensky has blasted the Olympic Committee as “ _playing into the hands of aggressors_ ” after it banned a Ukrainian athlete over a helmet depicting some of the ~600 athletes and coaches killed by Putin’s attacks. ([France24](<https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20260212-zelensky-blasts-olympics-ban-for-ukrainian-athlete-over-memorial-helmet>))

**Comment** : _When the stakes are existential (as for Ukraine), the apolitical quickly looks political. We_ _[explored](<https://archives.internationalintrigue.io/p/the-geopolitics-of-the-winter-games>)_ _the geopolitics of the Winter Games last week._

🇰🇪 **KENYA** **— Let’s try this again.**  
President Ruto has announced Kenya will reopen its border with Somalia in April, almost 15 years after al-Shabab terrorist attacks forced its closure. ([BBC](<https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70k4yw049yo>))

**Comment** : _It’s a good sign, though less so when you consider this announcement has been delayed multiple times over the years due to insecurity, and Ruto is now having to accompany the move with a big troop deployment. We_ _[explored](<https://archives.internationalintrigue.io/p/reduced-size-template-35d4b9aa64699882>)_ _some of the security challenges facing the Horn of Africa on Wednesday._

🇲🇽**MEXICO — To the rescue.**  
Two Mexican naval ships have docked in Cuba with ~536 tonnes of food and other humanitarian aid, a couple of weeks after President Trump threatened tariffs on anyone supplying the Cubans with oil. ([AP](<https://apnews.com/article/mexico-cuba-humanitarian-aid-havana-us-sanctions-52c44db94c9423511d67366662e78ac4>))

**Comment** : _We_ _[explored](<https://archives.internationalintrigue.io/p/is-cuba-next>)_ _the Cuba situation earlier this week. Since then, Air Canada has suspended flights due to the local fuel shortage, further straining Cuba’s critical tourism sector. It’s unclear where this lands, but there’s a growing sense something will break._

🇸🇦**SAUDI ARABIA — New kid in town.**  
The kingdom has appointed a new investment minister (Saif), quietly putting the old guy out to pasture as the crown prince’s big Vision 2030 hits turbulence. The new minister was previously an exec at Riyadh’s $925B _Public Investment Fund._ ([Al-Monitor](<https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2026/02/saudi-arabia-names-new-investment-minister-vision-2030-funding-lags>))

**Comment** : _It’s a tricky bind for the Saudis, who are already running a deficit (impressive for the world’s ~largest oil exporter), but realistically need to keep spending if they want to diversify away from oil and hit their ambitious $100B annual FDI target by 2030._

###  Meme of the day

No offence to the many good ones, but oh lordie, find yourself serving under a bad political ambassador and you’ll soon be arriving at meetings like rapper 21 Savage arrived at the Super Bowl: absolutely hugging that wall to maximise your distance from the fallout as your happy but hapless envoy mangles greetings, offends locals, then aggressively brings up the one thing your notes begged the ambassador not to raise.
