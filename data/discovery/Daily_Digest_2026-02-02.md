## Stock & Markets Analysis

### 1. Market & Macro Overview
The market is exhibiting sharp "Reflexive" divergences.
* **The Bust:** A historic liquidation in safe havens (Gold -10%, Silver -30%) triggered by the "Hawkish" Warsh Fed nomination and easing geopolitical tensions (Iran), shaking out "late to the rally" speculators (WSJ #32, Stocks #1).
* **The Boom:** Conversely, the Dow surged >500 points driven by a "Reflexive Boom" in industrial sentiment, validated by a surprise upside in Manufacturing PMI (WSJ #16).
* **Sentiment:** Shift from "Fear" (Gold hoarding) to "Growth/Execution" (Industrial/Tech buying).

### 2. AI Ecosystem Positioning (Sector-Specific)
* **The Reflexive Loop:** **Oracle (ORCL)** raising $50B (Stocks #5, #8) is the definitive signal of the "Hyperscaler funding" phase accelerating. This massive capital injection is needed to sustain the "Circular Loop" of CapEx -> Revenue.
* **Compute & Infrastructure (Layer 3):** Oracle's move confirms 2026 is an "Execution Year." The "Memory Shortage" flagging **Micron (MU)** (Stocks #11) confirms physical bottlenecks are shifting from GPUs to memory/power.
* **Models & Tools (Layers 4-7):** **Snowflake (SNOW)** partnering with OpenAI for $200M (Stocks #10) signals consolidation where data platforms must pay "tolls" to model providers to stay relevant.
* **Applications (Layer 8):** **Palantir (PLTR)** reporting 70% revenue growth and a 127% "Rule of 40" score (Stocks #7) is a critical data point suggesting the "Revenue Gap" may be closing for best-in-class apps, validating the "Subsidy Effect" is translating to real cash flow for winners.

### 3. Applied Investment Flags (General)
* **Reflexivity & Fertile Fallacies (Oracle):** ORCL's $50B raise is a double-edged sword. It validates the AI buildout but risks a "Fertile Fallacy" if the eventual return on this massive CapEx doesn't materialize. The market is pricing in perfection.
* **The Glamour Metrics Trap (Palantir):** While PLTR's growth is real, trading at ~60x sales (Reddit ValueInvesting #6) makes it a textbook "Glamour" stock. The price action is driven by top-line excitement; the risk is if growth slows even marginally, the multiple collapse will be severe.
* **Mispricing vs. Impairment (Nike):** NKE down 50% but trading at 36x Earnings (Reddit ValueInvesting #1) flags a potential "Permanent Structural Impairment" disguised as a value play. The brand heat may be gone, meaning historical multiples no longer apply.
* **Boom/Bust Anatomy (Precious Metals):** The Gold/Silver crash is a textbook "Bust" following a sentiment-driven rally. The "Greater Fool" theory (Reddit ValueInvesting #2) collapsed when the narrative changed (Warsh nomination).

### 4. Screening Candidates
* **Ticker/Theme:** **Oracle (ORCL)**
* **The Signal:** Announces $50B Equity/Debt financing (Stocks #5, #8).
* **The Why:** Unprecedented scale of capital raise. Is this offense (AI dominance) or defense (cash flow issues)?
* **Data Gap:** Need to verify exact terms of the debt/equity and stated use of proceeds (CapEx breakdown).

* **Ticker/Theme:** **Micron (MU)**
* **The Signal:** "Memory shortage" causing stocks to pop (Stocks #11).
* **The Why:** "Physical Bottleneck" play in the AI supply chain (Layer 1-2).
* **Data Gap:** Current spot pricing trends for DRAM/NAND and inventory levels.

* **Ticker/Theme:** **Ceotronics ($CEK)**
* **The Signal:** German "Hidden Champion," military supplier, potential new orders (Reddit ValueInvesting #11).
*   **The Why:** Classic "obscure small cap" value setup if the military contract thesis holds.
*   **Data Gap:** Audited financials and official order book confirmations.

# 🌍 World reacts to Epstein

Plus: The world’s ugliest lawn is...

Feb 2, 2026

**Today’s briefing:**  
— Our world reacts to Epstein (again)  
— New French award just dropped  
— And the world’s ugliest lawn is…

 _Sponsored by:_

[](<https://magic.beehiiv.com/v1/fbfee445-f583-41e6-b0b9-459df3b3a12e?email={{email}}>)

**Good morning {{first_name | Intriguer}}**. Two quick numbers to make you (or at least me?) feel old:

  1. Spain’s Alcaraz, who just beat Djokovic to win the men’s Australian Open, was only four years old the _first_ time Djokovic won the Open; and

  2. Britain’s best new artist at the weekend’s Grammys (Olivia Dean) was only two when Beyoncé won her first of 35 trophies.




Anyway, we need to talk about how **the world is responding to the latest Epstein files**.

### Number of the day

**12.7%**

That’s how quickly (annualised) Taiwan’s economy grew in Q4 last year, its fastest in decades amid record chip demand and US investment.

### **The Epstein files**

Some 42 days after they were due, the US justice department finally shared [the latest Epstein files](<https://www.justice.gov/epstein>) on Friday, featuring three million pages, 180,000 images, and 2,000 videos.

While it all pours more sordid pressure on familiar US figures (Trump, Clinton, Gates, Musk, Summers, Lutnick and beyond), it's also reverberating around the world, starting in...

  * 🇸🇰 **Slovakia**




The NATO ally's national security advisor and former foreign minister, **Miroslav Lajčák** , has finally now resigned after the latest dump revealed just how tight he was with Epstein — we're talking [texts](<https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet 10/EFTA01619736.pdf>) bantering about anything from females to Putin's foreign minister.

**Significance** : Finally a head rolls, but not just any head: Lajčák was pro-engagement with Russia, and the right-hand-man to Slovakia's famously Putin-friendly leader, Robert Fico.

  * 🇳🇴 **Norway**




This latest Epstein dump is huge news in Norway, where **the crown princess** (Mette-Marit) gets mentioned a thousand times! Turns out Norway’s future queen was close with Epstein, and even planned trips to his Palm Beach estate.

And as if the princess wasn’t enough, Norway's former prime minister and long-time head of the Council of Europe (**Thorbjørn Jagland**) also makes multiple appearances, seemingly acting as Epstein's go-between to the Kremlin.

**Significance** : It's a big embarrassment for one of Europe's most respected monarchies, already facing a shock assault trial of the princess's son. As for Jagland, his Epstein advocacy for Russia will shine new light on his years at the heart of European power, where he long advocated to keep Putin inside European institutions, which brings us to…

  * 🇷🇺 **Russia**




Putin himself gets mentioned 1,055 times, and Russia 5,876 times, whether it’s Epstein's supposed audiences with the Russian autocrat, unverified FBI informant claims that Epstein managed Putin's money, meetings to brief Putin's former UN ambassador (who later died a suspicious death), and even a 2015 Epstein email to an FSB-trained Putin insider (Sergei Belyakov) seeking help with a Russian woman blackmailing New York elites.

**Significance** : While last year’s Epstein dump fuelled Israel speculation, this latest edition has prompted the head of Estonia's parliamentary committee on foreign affairs to [suggest](<https://x.com/markomihkelson/status/2017521929997955483>) Epstein was running honeytrap operations for Russian intelligence, a theory now also [pondered](<https://x.com/sikorskiradek/status/2017901327158849695>) by Poland's foreign minister. Meanwhile…

  * 🇨🇳 **China**




The Middle Kingdom isn’t centre stage, though there are interesting snippets, whether it's former Trump aide Steve Bannon boasting about **a**) his own role in Trump's China tariffs, or **b**) getting an Australian billionaire to run anti-China ads in 2019 elections Down Under.

Interestingly, Harvard's student paper has also [detailed](<https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2026/1/31/epstein-chan-proposed-tsinghua-campus/>) Epstein's efforts to help Beijing's elite Tsinghua University (President Xi’s alma mater) establish a campus in Boston.

**Significance** : There's a bit of online schadenfreude in China that maybe the worst you can say about China's own elites here is they should've known better than to go via Epstein. It hints at the way this sordid saga trashes international perceptions of Western power.

  * 🇮🇳 **India**




Delhi's foreign ministry has come out firing after an Epstein email vaguely seemed to claim credit for the success of Modi's historic first visit to Israel in 2017 — Delhi's statement [dismisses](<https://www.mea.gov.in/Speeches-Statements.htm?dtl/40641>) it all as "_trashy ruminations by a convicted criminal_ ".

**Significance** : Plausibility aside, India's opposition is seizing on it, along with Epstein’s correspondence both with a member of India's richest family (Ambani) and current oil minister (Puri). Meanwhile, the timing is tricky ahead of Modi's next Israel visit this month.

  * 🇨🇦 **Canada**




We recently described Canada as **the Ned Flanders of neighbours** , and boy did Canada hold up its end here: its only substantive appearance seems to be a letter in which Canada's LA consulate tells Epstein he's banned from visiting. You see? You can just say no.

Anyway, this is just scratching the surface — bravado or something else, **there's not enough internet** to cover all the angles, whether it's Epstein pondering investments in Somaliland, or texting with Dubai's powerful Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, or implying he could jailbreak someone in Assad's Syria, or the suggestion of tapping ex-MI6 figures to recover Libya’s frozen state assets.

#### Intrigue’s Take

There are so many takeaways, but let’s look at two:

**First** , it’s a reminder that while we at Team Intrigue cut our teeth on the more formal side of diplomacy, states often seek to operate via **unofficial social brokers** — Epstein had no formal job title, but had half the world’s governments on speed dial.

**Second** , we’ve looked at the ways this scandal ripples across geography, but it’s**rippling across time** , too: drawing links to any impending US hit on Iran, Serbia’s leader (Vučić) just blamed his country’s 1999 demise at NATO’s hands not on Belgrade’s own disastrous policy of ethnic cleansing, but on Clinton’s attempts to distract attention from Lewinsky. Ie, Epstein is now even playing into ongoing Serbian revisionism.

Anyway, given this predator’s weird ability to collect world leaders like they’re Pokémon, something tells us there’ll be more ripples to come.

**_Sound even smarter:_**

  * The UK’s former ambassador to the US (Mandelson) is running out of posts to resign, but amid the latest Epstein release he’s just resigned from the UK’s ruling Labour Party too.

###  Meanwhile, elsewhere…

🇺🇸**UNITED STATES — Selloff.**  
Markets in Asia have taken a beating today (Monday), with key indices in Korea and Indonesia each down 5%, Hong Kong down 3%, and China down 2%. Commodity markets also plunged from their Thursday night highs, with gold and silver each crashing by double-digits. ([Reuters](<https://www.reuters.com/world/china/slump-commodities-rattles-global-markets-2026-02-02/>))

**_Comment_** _: Friday’s immediate trigger seems to have been President Trump’s nomination of the relatively hawkish Kevin Warsh as his next Fed chair, a conventional choice jolting investors to haul their cash out of sky-high safe-havens._

__ 🇮🇱**ISRAEL — Strikes, opening.**  
A day before Sunday’s partial reopening of Gaza’s Rafah crossing for the first time in two years, Israel carried out several airstrikes across the Strip, with scores reported dead. Israel says the hits were in response to violations by Hamas, which is in turn urging the US to intervene. ([BBC](<https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c701g1g00gdo>))

🇷🇺 **RUSSIA — Breaking promises.**  
Days after President Trump suggested Putin would halt energy attacks for a week during Ukraine’s harsh winter, a Russian drone has hit a bus carrying Ukrainian energy workers, killing 12. ([France24](<https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260201-russian-drone-strike-bus-transporting-ukrainian-energy-sector-workers-kills-15>))

🇹🇯**TAJIKISTAN — Guns to the rescue.**  
With security incidents along the Tajik-Afghan border now happening almost daily, the Russia-led _Collective Security Treaty Organization_ (CSTO, aka Russia’s NATO)__ now says it’ll supply arms to help bolster Tajik defences. ([EurasiaNet](<https://eurasianet.org/mounting-worries-on-tajik-afghan-border-prompt-csto-action>))

**_Comment:_**_CSTO’s remaining post-Soviet members will have questioned the bloc’s relevance ever since it did nothing to help Armenia in its territorial spat with non-member Azerbaijan. So with Armenia now bailing, the real point of this arms pledge is presumably just to demonstrate CSTO’s value to the rest._

🇰🇭 **CAMBODIA** **— Too late to join?**  
Nearly half a century after first signing on, Cambodia has finally now _ratified_ the UN’s key maritime law treaty (UNCLOS). ([SCMP](<https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3341350/thailand-border-threat-pushes-cambodia-sign-un-sea-treaty-after-over-40-years>))

_**Comment:**__Why now? With Cambodia’s big Thailand spat still simmering away, it reportedly fretted the Thai navy might cut its supply lanes, so formalising this treaty is probably a way to double down on every available protection._

🇨🇺**CUBA — Help is on the way.**  
Days after confirming she’d halted oil shipments to Cuba, Mexico’s President Sheinbaum has announced new humanitarian aid for Cuba. ([AP](<https://apnews.com/article/mexico-cuba-sheinbaum-humanitarian-aid-oil-0cad2c4f270321c897dd54e094763235>))

_**Comment:**__It’s a way to maintain Mexico’s traditional solidarity with Cuba without crossing Trump’s presumed new red lines about propping up the regime with oil._

🇮🇶**IRAQ — Gone too soon.**  
It seems President Trump’s new special envoy for Iraq (Mark Savaya) has already left the role amid rising US-Iraq tensions — it’s unclear why, though the folks at Reuters suggest it might’ve been Savaya’s failure to stop Iran-friendly powerbroker al-Maliki returning to Iraq’s prime ministership.

**France has been ninja-starring awards out these days** — Victoria Beckham just got made a _Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters_ last week, and Pharrell Williams became a _Chevalier of the Légion d’honneur_ too.

But have you heard of **Ali Akbar Akbar** (above)? President Macron just awarded him the _National Order of Merit_ in a shout-out to the half century he’s spent hawking papers on the streets of Paris, including to Macron himself during his student days. The French head of state put it like this: _“You are the accent of the sixth arrondissement, the voice of the French press on Sunday mornings. And every other day of the week, for that matter.”_

❌ This is a big deal (42%)  
✍️ Other (write us!) (2%)

**Your two cents:**

  * ✍️ **K.P:** “It might be a big deal for popular opinion, but it won't influence the higher level diplomacy too much in the near future.”

  * 😶 R.N: “The power of the image of America is strong but it won’t last forever. Course correct now to avoid locking in the damage permanently.”
