## Stock & Markets Analysis

### 1. Market & Macro Overview
The market is exhibiting signs of defensive posturing and "wrecking ball politics" (Intrigue #2). Sentiment is tempered by unexpectedly flat retail sales (WSJ #1, #14) and mounting consumer debt (Barron's #24), while treasury yields have declined in response to disappointing data (WSJ #14, #31). A significant geopolitical flag is China’s advisory for banks to curb U.S. Treasury exposure (WSJ #31, r/stocks #3), potentially signaling a reflexive shift in global capital flows. Gold and precious metals remain volatile but supported by underlying fundamentals (WSJ #3, #25), while the Dow Transport Index is showing localized strength in air freight (Barron's #2).

### 2. AI Ecosystem Positioning (Sector-Specific)
*   **Compute & Chips (Layers 1-2):** "Picks and shovels," specifically memory chips, continue to dominate the AI trade (WSJ #9). Ichor Holdings (chip-equipment) surged 35% on an earnings beat (Barron's #11), suggesting continued strength in the hardware supply chain.
*   **Infrastructure & Power (Layer 3):** Alphabet’s issuance of 100-year bonds to fund AI CapEx (r/ValueInvesting #3, #6) highlights the massive capital intensity and long-term bets being placed on infrastructure.
*   **Models & Tools (Layers 4-7):** Datadog provided "rare good news" for the software sector with an earnings beat (Barron's #44), but S&P Global plunged as its earnings failed to resolve AI-related concerns (Barron's #37, #38).
*   **Applications & Software (Layer 8):** The sector is under pressure following a UBS downgrade to "Neutral" citing software and CapEx risks (Barron's #1). However, J.P. Morgan identifies 19 "AI-resilient" software stocks, including Microsoft and CrowdStrike, suggesting the market may be over-discounting established moats (Barron's #16, #17).

### 3. Applied Investment Flags (General)
*   **Narrative vs. Reality:** Harley-Davidson and S&P Global saw significant plunges following earnings/guidance (Barron's #39, #37), where the narrative of "mixed earnings" may be concealing deeper structural disappointments. The surge in short interest for Michael Saylor’s Strategy (Barron's #3) and the snag in the first bitcoin-backed bond sale (WSJ #2) suggest a reflexive cooling in crypto-related speculation as Bitcoin slides.
*   **Edge Opportunities:** Kyndryl’s 50% plunge due to an accounting review and executive exits (Barron's #30) presents a potential "out-of-favor" situation if the problems prove solvable (Part I: Opportunity Sources). Conversely, Palantir faces a narrative shift as political winds threaten its U.S. government revenue concentration, specifically ICE-related contracts (r/stocks #5).

### 4. Screening Candidates

*   **Ticker/Theme:** Kyndryl (KD)
*   **The Signal:** Barron's #30, r/ValueInvesting #11.
*   **What News Says:** Plunged over 50% after announcing an accounting review, executive exits, and receiving a downgrade from Guggenheim.
*   **The Why:** Extreme price dislocation (50% drop) linked to "accounting review" is a classic high-priority red flag that requires distinguishing between temporary upheaval and permanent impairment (Guidelines Part I).
*   **Investigation Items:**
    - Verify nature of "accounting review" via SEC filings.
    - Analyze impact of executive exits on operational continuity.
    - Evaluate if the plunge represents a "Margin of Safety" opportunity or a "Permanent Impairment."
*   **Data Gap:** Specific details of the accounting discrepancies found in the review.

*   **Ticker/Theme:** S&P Global (SPGI)
*   **The Signal:** Barron's #37, #38.
*   **What News Says:** Shares in bear market territory after mixed Q4 earnings failed to resolve AI-driven concerns.
*   **The Why:** A high-quality brand name stock (Part II: Brand Name Dynamics) in a bear market due to "AI concerns" suggests a possible divergence between long-term moat durability and short-term sentiment.
*   **Investigation Items:**
    - Examine Q4 earnings for specific AI-related impact on revenue/margins.
    - Compare valuation multiples to historical bear market troughs.
    - Validate claims about software sector weakness affecting their data/analytics business.
*   **Data Gap:** Clarity on how AI specifically threatens or enhances SPGI’s data dominance.

*   **Ticker/Theme:** Alphabet (GOOGL)
*   **The Signal:** r/ValueInvesting #3, #6.
*   **What News Says:** Issued 100-year bonds for AI spending; Michael Burry and others cite a "deathcurse" narrative where long-term bond issuance precedes decline.
*   **The Why:** This is a "Narrative vs. Reality" flag. The 100-year bond could be a brilliant move to lock in capital for a reflexive boom, or a sign of terminal CapEx intensity.
*   **Investigation Items:**
    - Analyze the terms and interest rates of the 100-year bonds.
    - Evaluate AI CapEx projections vs. historical ROIC.
    - Research historical precedents of ultra-long corporate bonds (Motorola, etc.) to test the "deathcurse" narrative.
*   **Data Gap:** Long-term revenue generation plan for the AI infrastructure being funded.

*   **Ticker/Theme:** Palantir (PLTR)
*   **The Signal:** r/stocks #5.
*   **What News Says:** Over 60% of revenue derived from US Government; ICE funding pushback and potential midterm congressional flip threaten core contracts.
*   **The Why:** Identifies a specific "Edge Opportunity" or risk where political sentiment (Reflexivity) could materially alter the business’s "Economic Reality."
*   **Investigation Items:**
    - Verify revenue concentration in U.S. Government/ICE contracts via 10-K.
    - Search for legislative updates on ICE self-deportation app funding.
    - Assess the durability of commercial revenue growth to offset government risk.
*   **Data Gap:** Expiration dates and renewal terms for major ICE/Government contracts.

*   **Ticker/Theme:** Ichor Holdings (ICHR)
*   **The Signal:** Barron's #11, #12.
*   **What News Says:** Stock jumped 35% after earnings beat and upbeat outlook for chip-equipment supply.
*   **The Why:** A "Glamour Metrics" check is needed to see if the 35% jump is justified by cash flow or just top-line "upbeat outlook" (Part II: Glamour Metrics Trap).
*   **Investigation Items:**
    - Compare earnings beat to cash flow from operations.
    - Evaluate the "upbeat outlook" against industry-wide semiconductor equipment trends.
    - Check for "reflexive" valuation inflation in the chip-equipment sub-sector.
*   **Data Gap:** Sustainability of the current chip-equipment demand cycle.

# 🌍 Is Cuba next?

Plus: Don’t mess with this royal

Feb 10, 2026

**Today’s briefing:**  
— Is Cuba next?  
— Bombshell claims in Africa  
— Don’t mess with this royal

**Good morning {{first_name | Intriguer}}**. I must’ve seen too many Bacardi commercials by the time I first landed in Havana, expecting salsa in the streets and Cohiba in the air.

Sure, the famous Bacardi family still owns the company, but they’re based in Bermuda these days and make most of their rum in Puerto Rico. Plus there’s a good chance the Cohiba you once smoked was made by Scandinavians in the Dominican Republic.

The moment I stepped beyond Havana’s famous Hotel Nacional (think garden peacocks and _The Godfather Part II_), there was less street salsa, and more local folks hoping I’d share my hotel shampoo. Not wanting to be Debbie Downer here, but it’s a snippet of what daily life is like in Cuba, amid what a friend described to me as ‘beautiful decay’.

Anyway, with the US ramping up its pressure on the communist-run island, today’s briefing explores the question on everyone’s lips: **can Havana hold on?**

###  Bridge of the day

**Gordie Howe International Bridge**

That’s the name of a new US-Canada bridge whose opening President Trump is now threatening to delay until “ _the United States is fully compensated_ ”. It’s been at the centre of controversy for more than a decade. 

### **Cuban crisis**

There’s a real Netflix energy to geopolitics coverage right now — Maduro gets yeeted, and within hours everyone is frothing over season two (Cuba).

**So…** _**is**_**Cuba next?** Let’s find out.

In the spirit of casually summarising **seven decades of US-Cuba history** in a paragraph already part-wasted on throat-clearing, the TLDR is there’s been bad blood since Fidel Castro’s communists ousted the unpopular Batista administration, seized ~6,000 US-owned firms, executed ~1,000 political rivals, arrested tens of thousands more, and sent another quarter million folks fleeing in the initial exile wave alone.

It’s been **intrigue ever since** , with the US trying everything from the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, endless assassination plots, and modern history’s longest-running embargo, while Cuba has deployed tens of thousands of troops around the world, hosted Soviet nukes a jet-ski away from Miami’s beaches, and locked up its own people for suggesting that, you know, maybe they’d like a say in how their country is run. Cuban intelligence is strong, too, managing to recruit (say) deep in the DIA, and even a US ambassador.

And that brings us to **Trump 2.0** , who’s now ramped up pressure by… 

  * Seizing Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro and cutting Havana’s cheap oil

  * Pressuring Mexico to halt its own oil shipments, and

  * Threatening tariffs on anyone else supplying Cuba with oil.




The result is the island of 11 million people just ran out of jet fuel, and has maybe **20 days of regular fuel left** until life grinds to a halt: transport, agriculture, tourism, food distribution, and hospitals potentially going dark as Cuba’s blackouts go permanent.

**Why?** It’s the Donroe Doctrine of US pre-eminence in the region, and Trump’s gambit is Cuba’s leaders will do a deal: maybe prisoner releases, compensation for seized US assets, and/or cutting security ties with Russia and China, which both run big signals intelligence facilities out of Cuba targeting the US (which of course spies back). DC hardliners like Marco Rubio, born to Cuban émigrés, also want more: regime change.

**So… is Havana caving?** Not yet. Hardly a stranger to US pressure, it’s adapting instead, with new restrictions on fuel sales, plus a four-day work week for state employees — the idea is to reduce energy consumption so forex-generating activities like tourism can continue off Cuba’s own heavy oil output (covering ~40% of its energy needs).

**And…** _**will**_**Havana cave?**

To be clear, this is shaping up as Cuba’s biggest threat since the 1991 collapse of its key sponsors (the Soviets), and it was already under pressure via (say) rare 2021 protests or an unusually public and senior corruption scandal involving the economy minister in 2025.

Plus if Maduro’s fate is any guide, it’s hard to see **China or Russia** doing much beyond their current offers of food and oil, in yet another reminder of the regional limits of their own power, not to mention Cuba’s own isolation. Meanwhile, Maduro’s fate was also a reminder of not just US power, but Trump’s willingness to use it.

That being said, this island’s regime has proven **resilient** through decades of crises, retains **tight control** over society, has a **pervasive intelligence** network, and broader security services with **strong economic incentives** to hold on. Ditto, its repression has prevented any real opposition from even coming close to gaining traction.

So all that to say… **Cuba is no Venezuela** : any hit would be higher-risk, while any leader swap would be lower-reward. That’s why a continued economic squeeze seems more likely for now. And yet to the extent this just creates even more misery on the island, that’ll further complicate DC’s calculations around what (if any) hand to play next.

#### Intrigue’s Take

We once happened to be standing near a US president (Obama) when several senior Latin American officials came over to greet him. They had maybe 30 seconds with the world’s most powerful man before his motorcade whisked him out of their lives, and do you know what they did with those 30 seconds? They didn’t even _mention_ their own countries let alone some specific irritant. Rather, they thanked him for easing US pressure on Cuba.

And to be clear, these weren’t chardonnay socialists (known locally as ‘**caviars** ’). To the contrary, they were staunch critics of disastrous authoritarians elsewhere, like Maduro.

Our point in mentioning this anecdote? Cuba enjoys an amount of **quiet diplomatic goodwill** that’ll be surprising for anyone reared on US soundbites. And that goodwill stems not from elections, competence, or even affinity, but rather a historical narrative that’s widely accepted, particularly (but not exclusively) across broader Latin America.

It’s the narrative that Cuba alone proves **you can just say “** _**no**_**” to Washington**. It’s this same narrative that’s allowed the regime to frame itself as the noble victim of imperialism rather than (say) the chief architect of its own misery. And it’s the same narrative that also helps explain why Havana now has one of the world’s highest embassy densities.

All that to say, this narrative won’t save Cuba’s communist party from whatever may come. But it will explain why the region’s reaction will be a little more mixed.

**_Sound even smarter:_**

  * Two Mexican navy ships are on their way to the island carrying over 800 tons of initial humanitarian aid.

  * Havana-friendly Nicaragua just ended its visa exemptions for Cubans, ending a popular escape route for folks hoping to flee Cuba for the US.

  * Most nations vote against the US embargo on Cuba at the UN each year.

### Meanwhile, elsewhere…

🇮🇱**ISRAEL — More West Bank.**  
Israel’s security cabinet has loosened restrictions on Jewish citizens buying land in the West Bank, with the hardline finance minister (Smotrich) framing the change as "_deepening our roots in all regions of the Land of Israel and burying the idea of a Palestinian state._ " The Palestinian presidency in Ramallah has condemned the move as “ _deepening attempts to annex the occupied West Bank._ “ ([Le Monde](<https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2026/02/09/israel-announces-measures-to-deepen-control-over-west-bank_6750282_4.html>))

**Comment** : _The White House has also semi-opposed the move (by reiterating US opposition to West Bank annexation), but the elliptical comment from an unnamed official seems more an attempt to mollify angry US allies in the region rather than meaningfully tap Israel’s brakes ahead of Bibi’s White House visit on Wednesday._

🇩🇪 **GERMANY — Hofbrauhaus.**  
The organisers of the influential Munich Security Conference have released their annual report, arguing we’re in an age of “ _wrecking ball politics_ ” and that DC has abdicated its leadership of the free world. The Munich event kicks off this Friday. ([NYT](<https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/09/world/europe/trump-munich-conference-security-report.html>))

**_Comment:_**_The US ambassador to NATO has dismissed the report, but it’s not really US *ambassadors* the report has in mind._

🇹🇼**TAIWAN — Fewer jets?**  
The monthly number of China’s military flights across the median line has fallen to its lowest since Taiwan’s pro-autonomy Lai Ching-te took office two years ago. But lest anyone breathe a sigh of relief, we’re still talking five incursions a day, and Taiwan just accused China’s jets of “ _unusually dangerous_ ” manoeuvres in December. ([Japan Times](<https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2026/02/10/asia-pacific/politics/china-flights-taiwan-training-shift/>))

**_Comment:_**_So why the drop in incursions? The most plausible theory we’ve seen is a change in fighter pilot training away from mileage towards tactics._

🇵🇭 **PHILIPPINES** **— Under the radar.**  
The US Army has quietly begun a 50-soldier rotational presence in the Philippines, shifting from episodic visits to more sustained deployments. ([Military Times](<https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2026/02/07/the-us-armys-quiet-rotation-in-the-philippines/>))

_**Comment:**__The numbers are barely worth mentioning, which is precisely the point — this kind of gradual salami-slicing is playing China at its own game. Beijing’s inevitable protest will be met with a “chill, it’s only 50 troops”, and that’ll continue each time the number grows._

🇪🇹 **ETHIOPIA** **— Training camps.**  
According to Reuters, Ethiopia is hosting a secret training camp for the notorious RSF paramilitary accused of war crimes in Sudan’s civil war. And contrary to UAE denials, the Emiratis are reportedly funding and staffing the camp. ([Reuters](<https://www.reuters.com/investigations/ethiopia-builds-secret-camp-train-sudan-rsf-fighters-sources-say-2026-02-10/>))

**Comment** : _We recently explored Sudan’s civil war (and the RSF-UAE dynamic)__[here](<https://www.internationalintrigue.io/sudans-rsf-take-over-el-fasher-amid-reports-of-mass-atrocities/>)_ _._

🇻🇪**VENEZUELA — Just kidding.**  
Venezuelan authorities are rejecting claims they kidnapped opposition figure Juan Pablo Guanipa hours after his release, instead arguing they revoked his release because he violated his conditions. ([AP](<https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-us-prisoners-machado-guanipa-rodrigues-76aa97fc5557c17ecf80e3e23b3d338a>))

_**Comment:**__The regime is lying — his two conditions were monthly check-ins, and no travel abroad. The regime was also lying when it arrested him on trumped-up terrorism charges last May. It all likely reflects the different factions at play in Caracas — the ruling Rodriguez siblings pushing amnesty bills per their deal with the US, while hardline holdouts like Attorney-general Saab keep pursuing their foes._

###  Extra Intrigue

**Here’s what the world’s prediction markets are saying**

  * 🥇 There are 78% odds Norway will win the **most gold** at the Winter Games.

  * 🏛️ There’s a 65% chance of another**US government shutdown** by Valentine’s Day.

  * 💻 And forecasters are giving 82% odds that **Anthropic will have the best AI** model at the end of February, beating out OpenAI, Google, DeepSeek and others.




### Royalty of the day

Credits: Koninklijk Huis / Facebook

That lady about to absolutely bust a cap in someone’s a$$?

She’s none other than Queen Máxima of the Netherlands. The 54-year-old royal is doing the lieutenant colonel course, completing specialised officer training just after her daughter (Crown Princess Amalia) finished basic training.

Why? The queen says she wants to contribute to Dutch national security because safety _“can no longer be taken for granted."_

###  Today’s poll

### Do you think Cuba's communists will survive this latest crisis?

**Yesterday’s poll:** Do you think the US should be worried about China's decision to curb its US bond holdings?

💥 Yes, shots fired! (42%)  
😒**No, it's just more of the same (58%)**  
✍️ Other (write in!) (0%)

**Your two cents:**

  * 😒 **D.S:** “Pretty much every treasury in the world that can do so, is gently moving its reserves away from the US at the margins.”

  * 💥 **R.Y:** “This was always an eventuality, but given the behavior of President Trump it is happening a bit sooner rather than later.”

  * **✍️ N.C:** “The US should be more concerned about its uncontrollable deficit spending than China curbing US bond holdings.”
