The magic number Google needs to hit to surpass Nvidia is $380.50. That is just a 15.8% move from the current price of roughly $328 based on the close numbers.\n\nRemember what happened when Nvidia first took the top spot? It wasn't just a number, it was a psychological trigger. The moment they hit #1, every news outlet ran the headline, ETFs rebalanced, and retail chased the winner. Right now is that same wave for Google that is building up.  Once **across $380.50, the \"Google is King\" headlines start**, and the momentum buying kicks in. \n\n**The Apple capitulation leading to mobile dominance**\n\nApple announced Gemini is going to be the default native AI for Siri. Think about the distribution monopoly they just secured. They have Gemini native on 3 billion Android devices, and now they have integration across 1.5 billion iOS devices. Google now owns the AI layer on **100% of the mobile distribution channel**. No other competitor exists at this scale. They have effectively checkmated the entire edge consumer AI market.\n\n**They are cloud leaders**\n\nGoogle Cloud revenue is accelerating at a rate that is frankly terrifying for Amazon and Microsoft. We are talking about parabolic revenue expansion driven by AI infrastructure demand.  \nQ3 2025 Revenue: $15.15 billion (up **34% year-over-year**).  \nAnnualized Run Rate: The business is running at an annual pace of roughly $61 billion.  \nOperating Income: A record $3.59 billion for the third quarter, representing a 23.7% operating margin, indicating rapidly increasing profitability.  \nGoogle Cloud ended Q3 2025 with a **$155 billion backlog.**\n\n  \n**They are entertainment leaders**\n\nYoutube surpassed Netflix (and all other streaming services)  \nAccording to the latest Nielsen Gauge report, YouTube captured 13.4% of total TV time, Netflix at 8.8%. Also Netflix: 325M subscribers come for a specific show and siappear when it;s over (like now with stranger things) while YouTube which has 2 Billion users who keep coming back to long form and shorts from never ending list of creators the algorithm know they would like.   \n  \n**Google has it's own silicon**\n\nGoogle has been building its own TPUs for a decade, meaning they don't pay the \"Nvidia Tax\" that crushes other tech companies margins.\n\nGoogle can later on sell these chips to other hyperscalers. Can you imagine Microsoft or Meta running on Google silicon? If they confirm this new revenue stream the stock goes nuclear. They instantly become a potential top-tier AI chip supplier with massive margins, they even go for rent model like IREN or CRWV. This is a multi-billion dollar catalyst that is currently not being priced.\n\n**Even the valuation show's google is STILL mispriced**\n\nRight now the market is paying a massive premium for Nvidia's future while ignoring Google's present cash flow.\n\nLook at the P/E ratio comparison. Google 32.6x P/E. For Nvidia,45.8x P/E. **That makes Google roughly 29% cheaper on PE valuation basis.**\n\nIf Google were simply valued at the same multiple as Nvidia, its stock price would be roughly $460. to hit $400 target, al is needed is taht the valuation gap to narrow slightly.\n\n**Wall Street is quietly loading up**\n\nRaymond James just upgraded to a Strong Buy with a $400 target. Pivotal Research reaffirmed their Buy rating with a $400 target. Canaccord raised their target to $390. they are all converging on the same number right before the earnings.\n\n**The non digital assets**\n\nPixel 10 sales were up 28% year-over-year in September, capturing **7% of the US premium market** and stealing share directly from Samsung. And Waymo driverless taxi is no longer a side project. They are doing **450,000 paid rides** per week. They are live in Phoenix, SF, LA, and expanding fast. \n\n**TLDR**\n\nGoogle is winning on search, youtube, ads, cloud, AI Chip, driverless cars, mobile phones and is about to become the world's most valuable company.\n\n**On Feb 4th earnings call it will surge to the crossover point at $380.50 and after the call continue to $400.**\n\n\\*I’m holding 10k USD worth of $375C for Feb 6. I am calling Google at $400. I know that most of you are holding GOOG, so good luck tp us all.\n\nNext earnings: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) will hold its quarterly conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 financial results on Wednesday, February 4, at 1:30pm Pacific Time (4:30pm Eastern Time).\n\nLink for more info here: [https://abc.xyz/investor/news/news-details/2026/Alphabet-Announces-Date-of-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Financial-Results-Conference-Call-2026-\\_PQVrgzUKX/default.aspx](https://abc.xyz/investor/news/news-details/2026/Alphabet-Announces-Date-of-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Financial-Results-Conference-Call-2026-_PQVrgzUKX/default.aspx)",

Every single post is some RKLB, ONDS, IREN, etc. I would honestly rather have the NVO bagholders back, atleast they somewhat understand what value investing is. This sub is full of people posting stocks down 99% or circlejerking each other for their returns on pure speculative \"gamble\" plays.\n\nWhat used to be a sub for actual analysis has become a cesspool of vibe based investing, \"what stock is going to double my money this year\", acting like a stock moving means it was always value and everyone who laughed it off is an idiot. I know im contributing to the amount of people commenting on the downfall of this sub, but we need to have some guidelines or something at the least cuz im sick of coming here and seeing wall street bets.\n\nEdit: I dont want to be the person im complaining about so heres some stock im personally all in on (feel free to debate if its \"value\" but i refuse to speculate too much), some true value, and some \"cigar butts\", not financial advice do ur own dd. FFH: Canadian insurance giant but still tiny my american standards ie big potential upside. PE of 8, relatively low debt 15 YoY bookings growth. INCY: Pharmaceuticals, trading at 17ish PE, strong growth in recent quarters low debt, the works. AMZN: Fair valuation, core business is self explanatory, AWS prints money. RCL: Great consumer cyclical, low PE again growing super fast.\n\nFor the value, ABT, ACGL, PGR, NEM, ALL, CINF, CTRA. All below 15 PE, most have good dividends, relatively low debt. Probably wouldnt invest personally though, and a extremely deep value cigar butt im all in right now is ACHC, DD is pretty deep value, GPN deep value, KHC deep value. Any suggestions or disagreement id love to hear as well.\n\nEdit: Well thanks to any of those of you who pumped ACHC, up 25% this morning.",

Every single post is some RKLB, ONDS, IREN, etc. I would honestly rather have the NVO bagholders back, atleast they somewhat understand what value investing is. This sub is full of people posting stocks down 99% or circlejerking each other for their returns on pure speculative &amp;quot;gamble&amp;quot; plays.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What used to be a sub for actual analysis has become a cesspool of vibe based investing, &amp;quot;what stock is going to double my money this year&amp;quot;, acting like a stock moving means it was always value and everyone who laughed it off is an idiot. I know im contributing to the amount of people commenting on the downfall of this sub, but we need to have some guidelines or something at the least cuz im sick of coming here and seeing wall street bets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: I dont want to be the person im complaining about so heres some stock im personally all in on (feel free to debate if its &amp;quot;value&amp;quot; but i refuse to speculate too much), some true value, and some &amp;quot;cigar butts&amp;quot;, not financial advice do ur own dd. FFH: Canadian insurance giant but still tiny my american standards ie big potential upside. PE of 8, relatively low debt 15 YoY bookings growth. INCY: Pharmaceuticals, trading at 17ish PE, strong growth in recent quarters low debt, the works. AMZN: Fair valuation, core business is self explanatory, AWS prints money. RCL: Great consumer cyclical, low PE again growing super fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the value, ABT, ACGL, PGR, NEM, ALL, CINF, CTRA. All below 15 PE, most have good dividends, relatively low debt. Probably wouldnt invest personally though, and a extremely deep value cigar butt im all in right now is ACHC, DD is pretty deep value, GPN deep value, KHC deep value. Any suggestions or disagreement id love to hear as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Well thanks to any of those of you who pumped ACHC, up 25% this morning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
