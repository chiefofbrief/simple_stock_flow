      "summary": "The Lake Theater & Cafe in Lake Oswego, Oregon, says Amazon MGM asked it to stop screening the Brett Ratner documentary Melania after the venue advertised the film with cheeky marquee lines such as \u201cDoes Melania wear Prada? Find out Friday!\u201d and \u201cTo defeat your enemy, you must know them. Melania starts Friday.\u201d Manager Jordan Perry posted that \u201cthe higher ups\u201d at Amazon were upset and that Sunday would be the film\u2019s last day; the marquee was later changed to messages noting Amazon had called and that showings were canceled. Perry said he booked the film partly as a joke and to fill a slow week, but the decision drew heavy pushback from patrons, numerous emails and voicemails, and negative online reviews, and attendance was modest. The episode highlights tensions between a major distributor\u2019s marketing control and a small independent cinema\u2019s irreverent programming choices, and several outlets note the documentary has been controversial, costly for its distributor, and poorly reviewed.",

Companies such as Flex, Livble and Affirm typically pay landlords up front while renters repay in installments, which users say can ease monthly cash-flow problems for lower-income and gig-economy workers. Consumer advocates counter that these products often function like short-term loans, adding subscription fees and other charges that can amount to very high effective interest rates and deepen financial strain. The tradeoff is illustrated by a renter who paid a $14.99 monthly fee plus 1% of $1,850 in rent (about $33 total) to split his payments for convenience. With roughly 109 million Americans renting and many households classified as cost-burdened by the Census Bureau, the trend is raising questions about whether these services provide meaningful relief or introduce new risks that may warrant consumer protections.",

Reports place production costs at roughly $75 million, and despite a roughly $7 million opening weekend \u2014 strong for a documentary \u2014 that appears insufficient to cover the reported acquisition, production and marketing expenses, leaving theatrical profitability doubtful. Critics overwhelmingly panned the film as a tightly controlled PR piece, and its Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb scores plunged into the low single digits and about 1.1\u20131.3, respectively. Conservative supporters celebrated some screenings and urged awards, while social-media users and other outlets ridiculed claims of packed, cheering theaters as exaggerated.

      "summary": "Nancy Guthrie, 84, the mother of Today co\u2011host Savannah Guthrie, was last seen Saturday night at her Tucson home and was reported missing after failing to attend church; investigators believe she was likely taken against her will. Authorities found signs of forced entry, a blood trail outside the house, the Ring doorbell missing, life\u2011sustaining medication left behind, and said DNA recovered from the home has been linked to Guthrie; the FBI is assisting the probe. Multiple media outlets, including TMZ and a local station, say they received alleged ransom notes demanding a substantial Bitcoin payment with a wallet address and specific details about the home and Guthrie\u2019s clothing, though officials have not verified the notes\u2019 authenticity. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said no suspect or person of interest has been identified, detectives are interviewing anyone who may have had contact with Guthrie, and investigators are coordinating closely with the family. Law enforcement explicitly denied online rumors that son\u2011in\u2011law Tommaso Cioni is a suspect and urged the public not to share unverified accusations while labs and technology partners analyze evidence; Savannah Guthrie has taken leave from the Today show as the search continues.",

Its open-back design and rigorously matched drivers deliver a wide, natural soundstage at the cost of increased sound leakage, while an on-cable full-band MEMS boom microphone and separate signal paths keep voice chat clear. The headset ships with versatile cabling (including swappable 4.4 mm balanced, 3.5 mm, and 6.3 mm plugs plus a USB-C adapter) for use with DACs, consoles, and PCs. Availability has begun in the U.S., with outlets commonly reporting a $299.99 retail launch price though at least one review lists a $359 price, placing the Kithara between mid-range and higher-end gaming/audiophile alternatives.",

Unsealed records show Epstein attended a private August 2015 Palo Alto dinner with Silicon Valley leaders including Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman \u2014 a gathering honoring MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden and facilitated by Joi Ito \u2014 and internal notes indicate Zuckerberg\u2019s team asked Epstein to share contact details. Elon Musk appears repeatedly in the records \u2014 discussing a possible island visit, receiving thanks for a SpaceX tour and being asked about SolarCity assistance \u2014 though he has denied close ties and called Epstein a \u201ccreep.\u201d The files mention many other prominent names from Donald Trump to Bill Gates and proposed global guests such as Ngozi Okonjo\u2011Iweala and Emir Muhammad Sanusi II, prompting renewed public debate. Critics note the disclosure is partial and heavily redacted \u2014 reportedly about 3.5 million of roughly 6 million pages collected were released \u2014 fueling skepticism that the documents will yield new accountability. The records also include mundane and incidental items \u2014 restaurant refusals, UFC\u2011related references to figures such as Joe Rogan and the Fertitta brothers, and an attempt to buy footage of a Jon Jones fight \u2014 and some people named (including Jones and journalist Mehdi Hasan) say their mentions were purely incidental.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "In an email Musk wrote he was \u201cworking to the edge of sanity\u201d and, after the holidays, wanted to \u201chit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose,\u201d adding that \u201ca peaceful island experience is the opposite of what I\u2019m looking for,\u201d a direct quote that appears in the released records.",
        "The suggestion to invite Ngozi Okonjo\u2011Iweala and Emir Muhammad Sanusi II to an \u201cout of the box\u201d dinner with Epstein came in an email dated May 21, 2018, from Jide Zeitlin \u2014 then chairman and CEO of Tapestry, Inc. \u2014 who proposed them as two prominent Nigerian figures for a June gathering.",
        "Reid Hoffman not only hosted the August 2015 Palo Alto dinner but previously visited Epstein\u2019s Little St. James island in 2014 and had planned overnight stays at Epstein\u2019s Manhattan townhouse; Hoffman has since apologized for his interactions, calling them a \u201cmajor error\u201d and urging full release of files to aid victims."

      "summary": "Washington Democratic leaders unveiled legislation to impose a 9.9% income tax on annual earnings above $1 million, a change from the state's longstanding no-income-tax policy that backers say would affect under 1% of taxpayers and raise about $3.7 billion a year. The proposal directs revenue toward K\u201312 education, health care, higher education, human services and expansion of the Working Families Tax Credit, and would also eliminate sales tax on hygiene products and exempt very small businesses from the state B&O tax. Sponsors designed the bills as emergency legislation that would block a referendum, include a null\u2011and\u2011void clause that would void the entire act if a court strikes the tax, and set the tax to take effect Jan. 1, 2028. Gov. Bob Ferguson\u2014who has previously supported the concept\u2014said he cannot back the current draft because it does not return a sufficient share of revenue as tax relief for residents and businesses. Supporters argue the plan shifts the tax burden to wealthier households and has growing public backing, while opponents warn it could harm competitiveness and accelerate out\u2011migration of high earners and businesses.",

        "Because the bills are drafted as emergency legislation exempt from referendum, the only realistic path to undo them would be a full initiative campaign that must get an affirmative voter repeal rather than suspending the law via referendum.",
        "The proposal includes a suite of narrow exemptions and credits \u2014 for family business sales and real property \u2014 and would provide credits for existing B&O, public utility, capital gains and pass\u2011through entity taxes."

Companies such as Flex, Livble and Affirm typically pay landlords up front while renters repay in installments, which users say can ease monthly cash-flow problems for lower-income and gig-economy workers. Consumer advocates counter that these products often function like short-term loans, adding subscription fees and other charges that can amount to very high effective interest rates and deepen financial strain. The tradeoff is illustrated by a renter who paid a $14.99 monthly fee plus 1% of $1,850 in rent (about $33 total) to split his payments for convenience. With roughly 109 million Americans renting and many households classified as cost-burdened by the Census Bureau, the trend is raising questions about whether these services provide meaningful relief or introduce new risks that may warrant consumer protections.",

      "summary": "Building production AI products is less about novel models and more about robust data infrastructure and focused engineering: an Amazon listing-optimizer guide stresses reliable scraping, rate limiting, keyword tracking, and using professional APIs so teams can concentrate on differentiated features. Managed foundation-model platforms like Amazon Bedrock let developers build generative AI apps without owning GPUs or complex deployments by exposing multiple models through a consistent API. In production, evaluation and governance are critical: Amazon Nova\u2019s LLM-as-a-Judge on SageMaker AI provides validated, model-agnostic workflows to assess generative outputs beyond traditional metrics. Operationalizing models is simplified with SageMaker AI Projects\u2019 S3-based templates, which offer versioned, reusable CloudFormation templates, CI/CD integration, and one-click provisioning to reduce ModelOps overhead. And at the product level, experimenting by shipping multiple small, focused AI tools can accelerate discovery and allow teams to learn quickly and scale the winners while leveraging managed services and solid data pipelines to avoid infrastructure pitfalls.",
      "keyPoints": [
        "The Amazon listing-optimizer guide recommends concrete engineering practices beyond scraping and rate limiting \u2014 for example, using connection pooling for database and API connections, tracking product-to-keyword relationships and average keyword rank, and ships production-ready code examples so teams can adopt them as starting points. The guide also recommends using professional data APIs (it names Pangolinfo) to avoid reinventing commodity infrastructure.",
        "Amazon Nova\u2019s LLM-as-a-Judge is presented as a rigorously validated, model-agnostic evaluator that claims to remain impartial across architectures, achieve leading performance on judge benchmarks, and closely reflect human preferences by leveraging LLMs\u2019 reasoning capabilities to assess generative outputs at scale.",
        "Amazon Bedrock\u2019s framing of foundation models emphasizes their flexibility: the same foundation model can be prompted to answer questions, summarize text, create code, or rewrite material \u2014 illustrating why Bedrock exposes multiple such models through a single managed API so developers don\u2019t need to operate GPUs or custom deployments."

Purchases include a $70 million site near Phoenix and an $87.4 million, 500,000+ square-foot warehouse in Berks County, Pa., and reporting indicates at least two dozen other warehouse deals are underway. Some transactions are reported to be in escrow with timelines suggesting facilities could open within months. Local governments and residents say they were often not notified and have limited legal recourse because federal projects are generally immune from local zoning; that has prompted actions such as a closed-door legal briefing in Surprise, concerns raised by Social Circle officials, protests and statements from Latino and Black legislative caucuses, and a moratorium in Kansas City. ICE and DHS have provided few public specifics but described the locations as \"well structured detention facilities\" and pointed to recent federal funding (the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\") to expand detention capacity.",

Firms including Amazon, Pinterest and Dow have framed some workforce reductions as part of a shift toward AI and automation, though Amazon told employees AI was not the reason for the vast majority of its 16,000 corporate cuts and described the moves as organizational streamlining. Laid-off workers like Amazon\u2019s N. Lee Plumb and some economists suspect companies may also be correcting past overhiring or using AI as a convenient efficiency narrative to signal value to investors. Opinion is divided among experts: some AI researchers warn of broad displacement, while investors and leaders such as Ben Horowitz emphasize historical patterns of automation creating new kinds of work and argue the future is unpredictable. Broader analysis warns the current wave of AI could mark a Fourth Industrial Revolution in which productivity and markets increasingly decouple from labor demand, raising hard questions about long-term joblessness and the sustainability of the social contract.",

The lean, startup-style two-pizza team is primarily product engineers and scientists and will leverage AWS and multiple large language models to build tools that integrate with industry-standard creative software and bridge the \"last mile\" of production workflows. Amazon says the tools will streamline schedules and budgets (for example by improving character consistency across shots) while leaving creative decisions to writers, directors, actors and designers. The AI Studio is already working with industry partners, including producer Robert Stromberg, Kunal Nayyar's Good Karma Productions and former Pixar/ILM animator Colin Brady, and is inviting select partners to test and refine the tools. The effort reflects pressure from rising production budgets and comes amid a broader company-wide push to find AI uses following recent corporate cuts.",

Gov. Bob Ferguson\u2014who has previously supported the concept\u2014said he cannot back the current draft because it does not return a sufficient share of revenue as tax relief for residents and businesses.

The company beat headline estimates\u2014reporting $81.3 billion in revenue (up 17%) and adjusted EPS of $4.14\u2014but Azure and other cloud services growth decelerated to roughly 38\u201339%, missing Wall Street \u201cwhisper\u201d expectations. Investors also focused on a surge in capital expenditures\u2014$37.5 billion for the quarter, up about 66% year\u2011over\u2011year\u2014as management framed the spending as necessary to build \u201cAI super\u2011factories.\u201d Microsoft said its cloud backlog more than doubled to about $625 billion with a large portion tied to OpenAI, yet analysts warned rising AI-related costs could pressure margins and earnings momentum. The shock has reverberated through the broader tech-heavy market as investors increasingly demand a clearer near\u2011term path to profitability from massive AI investments.",
