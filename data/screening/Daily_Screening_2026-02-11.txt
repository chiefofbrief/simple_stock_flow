-------------------------------------------------------------------

TIER 1 — WORTH DEEPER ANALYSIS
-------------------------------------------------------------------

NOW (ServiceNow)
    Price Behavior: Down -33.1% YoY, at 52-week low ($106.48). Has given
    back all of its 2023-2024 gains. The -9.0% 1-month decline is accelerating
    a trend that started mid-2025 from a $205 peak.

    Earnings Trends: The standout in this group. EPS has grown every year
    for five straight years: $0.92 -> $1.21 -> $2.14 -> $2.45 -> $3.51.
    That's roughly 40% CAGR. Recent quarters all beat estimates (3-15%
    surprises). Earnings CV of 0.45 reflects the growth trajectory itself,
    not instability. Forward estimates expect continued growth ($4.16 FY2026,
    $5.01 FY2027).

    Earnings vs. Expectations: Consistent beater. Q3 2025 surprise of +12.9%
    and Q2 of +15.5% are meaningful. Analyst consensus is tight, suggesting
    high confidence in the earnings trajectory.

    Price-Earnings Relationship: This is where it gets interesting. P/E has
    compressed from 141x (2021) to 30x today — an 80% decline in multiple.
    The 5-year average P/E of 80x is being dragged by historically absurd
    multiples. At 30x with ~40% EPS growth, this is the cheapest NOW has
    ever been on an earnings basis. Price-EPS correlation of 0.56 suggests
    sentiment, not fundamentals, is driving the selloff. The AI-fear
    narrative (that AI disrupts enterprise SaaS) is driving the discount
    per the daily digest context.

    Key Consideration: The central question is whether AI genuinely threatens
    NOW's workflow automation moat, or whether this is a "brand name stock"
    (Guidelines Part II) experiencing a solvable one-time sentiment problem.
    JPM's "AI-Resilient" screen explicitly includes NOW as a heavyweight
    opportunity. At 30x with 40% EPS CAGR, the margin of safety argument is
    stronger than anything else in this screen. Proceed to financial
    statement analysis.

CRM (Salesforce)
    Price Behavior: Down -27.4% YoY, also at 52-week low ($193.45). 5-year
    return is negative (-7.6%) despite a 2023 recovery from the 2022 crash.
    The stock has now round-tripped back below its 2021 level. CV of 0.21
    is moderate — not a wild stock historically.

    Earnings Trends: More complicated than NOW. EPS grew from $4.80 (FY2022)
    to a peak of $10.19 (FY2025), then fell to $7.79 (FY2026) — a -23.6%
    drop. This is the critical question: why did EPS decline? The quarterly
    data shows volatile results ($2.78, $2.58, $1.96, $3.25) with a CV of
    0.27. Forward estimates expect recovery ($11.77 FY, $13.12 next FY) but
    the current year decline is real.

    Earnings vs. Expectations: Has beaten estimates in all 4 recent quarters
    (1-14% surprises), so the EPS decline isn't a "miss" story — analysts
    were already expecting it. The forward delta of -$0.24 suggests next
    quarter is expected slightly lower than last.

    Price-Earnings Relationship: Trailing P/E of 18.3x vs. 5-year avg of
    33.6x is a 46% discount. This is a significant compression for a brand
    name stock. The P/E has been declining steadily (49x -> 40x -> 26x -> 25x).
    Price-EPS correlation of 0.53 is moderate — suggests some disconnect
    between price and fundamentals. The Emanuel "battered stocks" screen
    includes CRM as a squeeze candidate.

    Key Consideration: CRM is cheap on a P/E basis, but unlike NOW, EPS is
    actually declining. The question is whether this is a temporary cost
    investment cycle (AI integration, restructuring) or structural margin
    erosion. The fact that CRM keeps beating estimates while EPS declines
    suggests the decline is expected/deliberate. Worth a financial statement
    deep dive to check cash flow trends and the source of EPS pressure.
    Proceed to financial statement analysis, but lower conviction than NOW.

IT (Gartner)
    Price Behavior: The most dramatic decline in the group: -61.9% YoY,
    -23.7% in the last month alone. From $484 (2024) to $160 — a 67%
    drawdown from peak. This is severe for a data/research business
    historically characterized by stable revenues.

    Earnings Trends: 5-year EPS trend appears solid on the surface ($9.26
    -> $11.29 -> $11.33 -> $16.58 -> $10.07). But the 2024 spike to $16.58
    was an outlier, and the reversion to $10.07 is a -39% drop. More
    critically: Q3 2025 reported $0.47 vs. $2.12 estimate — a -77.8%
    miss. This is an enormous anomaly. The surrounding quarters ($2.71,
    $3.53, $3.36) are normal, so $0.47 almost certainly reflects a one-time
    charge or write-down, not operational collapse.

    Earnings vs. Expectations: Outside of the Q3 anomaly, IT beats
    estimates by 5-8%. Forward estimates of $13.17 (FY2026) and $14.48
    (FY2027) assume normalization. The consensus is narrow and expects
    recovery. But the market clearly does not believe it at $160.

    Price-Earnings Relationship: P/E of 15.9x vs. 5-year avg of 32x — a
    50% discount. Price-EPS correlation is strong at 0.76, meaning price
    historically tracks earnings well. The current divergence (price
    collapsing while normalized earnings are stable) is exactly the kind
    of signal the Guidelines describe under "Opportunity Sources" — a
    high-quality business with a large but potentially solvable problem.
    The AI-fear narrative (that AI disrupts Gartner's research/advisory
    moat) is the driver.

    Key Consideration: The Q3 $0.47 EPS needs to be explained — was it
    a restructuring charge, goodwill impairment, or something operational?
    If one-time, the normalized P/E around 12-13x for a historically
    30x stock is a massive discount. The AI disruption thesis has some
    validity (LLMs could compete with analyst reports), but Gartner's
    brand and enterprise relationships are sticky. Proceed to financial
    statement analysis to clarify the Q3 anomaly and assess cash flow
    durability.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

TIER 2 — MONITOR / CONDITIONAL
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KD (Kyndryl)
    Price Behavior: The worst performer: -51.7% in one month, -64.6% YoY.
    At $11.12, it's back to its 2022 low. The stock had been recovering
    from its IBM spin-off losses ($-11.72 EPS in FY2022) and was
    successfully turning around — then collapsed in February.

    Earnings Trends: The turnaround was real: from -$11.72 to -$6.06 to
    -$1.49 to +$1.09 to +$1.27. Four straight years of improvement.
    But the earnings CV of 1.46 reflects the massive swing from deep
    losses to profitability — this is inherently unstable. Last quarter
    missed estimates (-16.1%), which is concerning in the context of
    everything else happening.

    Price-Earnings Relationship: P/E of 6.2x vs. only 1 year of positive
    earnings history. Price-EPS correlation is strong at 0.86, meaning
    the market had been correctly pricing the turnaround — and is now
    correctly pricing the risk of that turnaround failing.

    Key Consideration: This fits the Guidelines' "Opportunity Sources"
    framework perfectly — management upheaval, SEC scrutiny, and
    confidence collapse. The question is whether CFO/GC/Controller
    departures + SEC document requests signal an isolated governance
    issue or a fundamental accounting problem (the "snowballing dynamic"
    from Part II red flags). FCF guidance was slashed from $550M to $350M.
    Do NOT proceed to financial statement analysis yet. Wait for: (1)
    SEC inquiry resolution or disclosure, (2) next earnings report under
    new management. The risk of permanent impairment is too high to
    invest analytical time now. Revisit if the SEC matter clarifies.

QCOM (Qualcomm)
    Price Behavior: Modest decline: -7.6% 1-month, -7.3% YoY. Currently
    right at its 5-year average price (-0.4%). CV of 0.17 is the lowest
    in this group — a relatively stable stock.

    Earnings Trends: Classic cyclical: $12.53 -> $8.41 -> $10.21 -> $12.03.
    Earnings swing with the semiconductor cycle. Recent quarters show a
    recovery trend ($2.85 -> $2.77 -> $3.00 -> $3.50) with consistent
    small beats (1-5%). Earnings are heading in the right direction.

    Price-Earnings Relationship: P/E of 11.6x vs. 5-year avg of 13.4x is
    a modest -14% discount. Not dramatic. The negative price-EPS
    correlation (-0.18) is characteristic of cyclical stocks where the
    market looks through the cycle. The memory crunch narrative from
    the daily digests (forcing phone production cuts) is a headwind.

    Key Consideration: QCOM is fairly priced for a cyclical semiconductor
    company. No margin of safety signal. The forward delta of -$1.01 (next
    quarter estimate well below last) suggests analysts expect a
    seasonal/cyclical dip. No compelling reason to proceed to deeper
    analysis — this is a "market price reflects reality" situation. Skip.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

TIER 3 — AVOID
-------------------------------------------------------------------

CLVT (Clarivate)
    This is chronic value destruction, not temporary dislocation. Price is
    down -92.2% over 5 years ($23.52 -> $2.06), with a -40.5% CAGR. Every
    single year has been a decline since 2021. Earnings peaked at $0.85
    (2022) and have fallen to $0.21 — with a negative quarter (-$0.11) in
    Q2 2025. Price-EPS correlation of 0.32 suggests the price is
    disconnected from even these deteriorating fundamentals. The AI-fear
    selloff adds to an already terminal-looking trend. Forward estimates
    project flat EPS ($0.66 for both FY2025 and FY2026 — no growth).
    Per the Guidelines: "Distinguish temporary problems from permanent
    impairments." This looks like permanent impairment. Skip.

ARM (ARM Holdings)
    ARM is the opposite problem — not undervalued but overvalued. The stock
    is UP +19.5% in the last month and +17.9% YoY. It trades at 73x P/E
    with EPS actually declining ($1.45 -> $1.25 -> $1.17 over 3 years of
    available data). The price-EPS correlation of -1.00 means price moves
    in the exact opposite direction of earnings. This is textbook
    "speculative due to excessive valuation" per Part I of the Guidelines.
    Only 3 years of public data (post-IPO). The market is pricing ARM for
    the AI/chip design narrative, not for current economic reality. No
    margin of safety. Skip.
