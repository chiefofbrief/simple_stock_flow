**Context**:
- It's more likely that the bubble is in the staples sector than in big tech.
- Stock in Charles Schwab is down about 13% from Monday’s close, when some of these fears surfaced. LPL Financial is down about 19%, and Ameriprise Financial is down around 16%. This week, news broke that start-up Insurify launched an app meant for use within the ChatGPT interface that allows users to identify insurance products. This could disrupt the insurance business, but it also sent wealth-management stocks reeling because the market fears such products could also replace human advisors. Also, Altruist, a relatively new and private custodian of assets that provides AI tools for clients, released Hazel, which helps clients manage their tax strategies.
- Charles Schwab looks interesting. First of all, it sees about 27% of its expected $26.5 billion of total 2026 revenue from asset management, according to FactSet, which means advisory services (a division of its asset management segment) are less than 27% of total revenue. So, the advisory business, while important for the company, isn’t its be-all-end-all segment.
- Still, advisory matters for Schwab—and these AI products don’t have to take a lot of market share away from the brokerage giant. A company like Altruist is a direct competitor, but customers who already have their finances and information entrenched with Schwab are likely to stick with the platform, and the company’s ability to sign up more customers—it has 46.5 million total client accounts—isn’t much impaired. For more complex financial advice and strategies, human perspective is still crucial and likely unthreatened by AI today.
- Elsewhere, LPL Financial is worth a look. About half of its $21 billion is advisory revenue. It, too, is using AI to not only enhance its advice to clients, but also to slim down the number of employers and analysts it relies on. This can improve profit margins, helping support earnings growth. The stock looks more attractive now, trading at 13 times earnings, versus a peak in the last five years in the high teens.
- Cisco reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue after the stock market closed on Wednesday. But by late Thursday morning, the shares were down 10% to $76.74, on pace for their largest percentage decrease since May 19, 2022, according to Dow Jones Market Data...Margin data disclosed Wednesday were a major reason for Thursday’s decline. Chief Financial Officer Mark Patterson said on a call to discuss the results that total non-GAAP gross margin came in at 67.5%, down 1.20 percentage points from the previous year. In the third quarter, Cisco expects a gross margin of between 65.5% and 66.5%, compared with 68.6% in the prior year.
- The surge in capital spending for things like new gigantic data centers means depreciation expenses will be soaring in the coming years. Much of the equipment these companies are buying, such as chips for artificial intelligence, will be gradually written down in value over five or six years, hitting profits.
- One major issue: Investors can’t find depreciation expenses listed on the income statements for Alphabet GOOGL -0.82%decrease; red down pointing triangle, Amazon.com AMZN 0.43%increase; green up pointing triangle, Meta, Microsoft MSFT 0.24%increase; green up pointing triangle or Oracle ORCL 2.70%increase; green up pointing triangle. Nor is there any consistency among the companies in how they choose to report these costs. While this is a problem across many industries, not just tech, it is becoming more acute at the biggest AI hyperscalers. Apart from Amazon, which has long operated a massive logistics network, these companies are transforming from asset-light to asset-heavy businesses...Contrast the tech companies’ reporting methods with the longstanding approach by two railroad companies, in a quintessentially asset-heavy industry. Union Pacific UNP -0.07%decrease; red down pointing triangle and Norfolk Southern NSC 0.30%increase; green up pointing triangle each report depreciation as a stand-alone operating expense on the income statement. That way investors know the other expense lines don’t include any of it...Rule changes to address the problem are on the way. Those, however, won’t take effect for most companies until 2028. A new U.S. accounting standard approved in 2024 will require companies to disaggregate quarterly expenses into five specific categories, including depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, and employee compensation...Alphabet and Oracle report depreciation separately as a stand-alone line on the cash-flow statement, where they reconcile net income with operating cash flow. But that doesn’t help much with modeling an income statement and the impact that depreciation has on each cost bucket. Amazon, Meta and Microsoft combine depreciation and amortization into a single line on the cash-flow statement, and then disclose depreciation expenses separately in footnotes.
- Everyone rotates in consumer staples stocks which should be a defensive sector as a shelter from high valuations in the tech sector. Since the PE ratio is the most accepted method for assessing the value of a stock, I'm giving an overview of the largest stocks in this sector. I picked the 13 largest in the sector. The average P/E ratio of the stocks listed here is approximately 31.36. Average PE ratio for all 245 stocks in sector (source StockAnalyisis.com) is 33,21. Historically, the average P/E ratio for the U.S. consumer staples sector has generally hovered around 17x to 23x.
- PYPL: Honestly I'll probably tap out at 3x, and find a new hated stock. Who knows maybe my old go to mo will yield 10 percent again. I found an Activision at 500 mil MC no debt and 500 mil cash in 2003, it ultimately was 184x. But I won't lie, at 10x I peaced. The models I've looked at are 3 to 5 percent growth, all free cash flow goes to financial engineering buying back shares, and it tops out at 180 dollars. To get beyond that they'd need to actually do something unexpected.. maybe agentic ai pays off, maybe they get the Utah banking license and compete with sofi, maybe their ad network becomes big, maybe maybe maybe. I'm in big bc I don't need to believe in maybes. Just buybacks and math and around 120, I'm probably out.
- NLFX: When stocks trade at 35x PE, any bump in the road or threat to future growth will be super damaging to the stock price. At that valuation, you're basically pricing in perfection from the company. They have fantastic margins that have seen consistent growth year over year. It's trading pretty close to book value right now, could be a good entry point. However, there's a lot of turbulence with the WB deal. Feels like everyone is just waiting for that to finalize. If the DOJ blocks the deal, or if they choose Paramount, the stock could slip even further....I was seeing it the other way. That NFLX would be looking for a reason to get out of the deal and PSKY raising their offer would be a graceful off-ramp for them. NFLX’s next stage in growth will be competing against YouTube (vs consolidating in VOD) and they would redouble their efforts on that. When the deal falls through, NFLX’s stock would soar with all of that debt coming off their balance sheet.
- Intuit: For context: I run a small boutique accounting firm (12 employees). Our clients use a mix of platforms, and we work with whatever they’re on : Xero, Wave, Sage (the worst in my op), FreshBooks, Zoho, etc. In my day-to-day experience, QuickBooks Online is the strongest overall product in that group. It’s the most polished, the workflows make sense, and it feels like a modern platform rather than software that’s been duct-taped together over time. On the AI angle: I’m also a heavy AI user (Claude + ChatGPT daily). I know the accounting industry is heading into serious disruption but I don’t think AI “replaces accounting/tax software.” If anything, it makes those platforms more valuable, because the software becomes the system of record and the place AI actually plugs into. Intuit has historically been early to major shifts (cloud adoption, integrations, etc), and QBO already has AI baked into the product experience in a way that feels practical, not gimmicky. One other point that doesn’t get talked about enough: support. From an accountant perspective, Intuit’s callback times and overall responsiveness have been consistently solid. We often get a call back within minutes when we need tech support, although I believe this varies by size of client book.
- Micron:  The memory market, especially HBM will be supply constrained for 3 years+. It's the 3rd top position in my portfolio behind NVDA and GOOGL. I expect multiple expansion and margin expansion...This information is and was widely known since the middle of last year, maybe even before and that’s why we saw a massive run up. I’m thinking the upside is still present but limited and will contend with capex and refurbishment issues starting in 2028/2029. Hence the cyclical nature of these markets. Not to mention any delay in the US fab investment will probably shake the stock. Let’s see. I’m riding till 650-750.
