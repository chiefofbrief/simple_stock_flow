## Daily Priority — 2026-04-22

### Analyze Now
1.  **IT (Promote from WATCHLIST)** | LOSER — EPS+ | P/E 13.9x | vs_1Y -68.5% | ROIC 47.8% | This is a textbook dislocation with a massive price drop in a high-quality (47.8% ROIC), profitable business that is still growing earnings.
2.  **NFLX** | LOSER — EPS+ | P/E 28.0x | vs_1Y -26.2% | EPS YoY +86.4% | A large-cap name is experiencing a significant price dislocation despite stellar, accelerating earnings and FCF growth, a classic narrative-vs-numbers mismatch.
3.  **FCX** | TAILWIND — AI SC L1 | Spread -40.3% | EPS YoY +154.2% | FCF YoY +557.9% | Earnings and free cash flow are growing dramatically faster than the stock price, signaling a powerful, under-appreciated fundamental acceleration in a critical AI supply chain layer.

### Add to Position
*   **ADBE**: Price ($237.01) is below entry ($250.00) while fundamentals (EPS YoY +11.4%, Rev YoY +12.0%) remain intact, presenting a clear opportunity to add to a quality position at a discount.
*   **CRM**: Price ($167.58) is below entry ($181.70) with solid underlying growth (EPS YoY +18.3%, Rev YoY +12.1%), making the current dip an attractive entry point to increase conviction.

### Remove
*   **CAG**: P/E —, ROIC -1.0%, Debt/OCF 5.3x | Remove | Quality metrics (negative ROIC, declining FCF, high debt) suggest structural weakness, not a temporary dislocation, despite the positive EPS YoY anomaly.
*   **ZM**: vs_1Y +17.1% | Remove | The price dislocation that formed the LOSER thesis has resolved; the stock is no longer out of favor.
*   **LRCX**: Spread +214.6% | Remove | Price appreciation has dramatically outrun earnings growth (Tier 4 Spread), inverting the risk/reward profile.
*   **HON**: EPS YoY -41.9%, FCF YoY -352.3% | Remove | The TAILWIND thesis is broken, with deterioration across both earnings and free cash flow.
*   **BE**: vs_1Y +1430.8% | Remove | The extreme price move has likely exhausted the reflexive cycle; risk/reward is now unfavorable.

**Promote to PIPELINE: AMKR** — TAILWIND with Tier 1 Spread of -21.9% (EPS YoY +288.2% vs. vs_1Y +266.3%) in a critical AI SC layer (L3).
**Promote to PIPELINE: ORCL** — TAILWIND with Tier 1 Spread of -0.6% (EPS YoY +24.5% vs. vs_1Y +23.9%); note FCF data error requires manual audit.
**Promote to PIPELINE: AIG** — LOSER — EPS+ with strong FCF YoY growth (+376.8%) and a low P/E (13.4x).

Stocks under active analysis. Work through three passes sequentially per `GEMINI.md`: Context → The Numbers → The Projection. Verdict (Status) written once, at end of The Projection. Market data columns updated daily by `Scripts/tracker_update.py` (automated via GitHub Actions).

**Tier 1 criteria (required for PIPELINE):** LOSER—EPS+ tag (EPS YoY > 0 AND vs_1Y < 0) OR TAILWIND with Spread ≤ 0% (EPS YoY ≥ vs_1Y). Anything below Tier 1 belongs in WATCHLIST.
