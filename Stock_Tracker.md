## Daily Priority — 2026-05-13

### Analyze Now
1.  **NFLX**: LOSER — EPS+ | P/E 28.2x | vs_1Y -23.9% | EPS YoY +86.4% | A high-quality, large-cap business where massive earnings growth (+86.4% YoY) and strong FCF (+91.4% YoY) directly contradict the negative price action (-23.9%), signaling a powerful sentiment-driven dislocation.
2.  **NVDA**: TAILWIND | P/E 46.1x | vs_1Y +66.9% | EPS YoY +97.8% | The central AI TAILWIND stock has a Tier 1 signal (Spread -30.9%) and an imminent earnings report (May 20), making immediate analysis critical before the data is refreshed.
3.  **FCX**: TAILWIND | P/E 35.5x | vs_1Y +73.9% | EPS YoY +154.2% | The most extreme price-to-earnings lag in the tracker (Spread -70.3%) offers a compelling, under-appreciated angle on the AI infrastructure buildout via its L1 (Raw Materials) position.

### Add to Position
*   **ADBE**: Price ($236.07) is below entry ($250.00) while fundamentals remain solid (EPS YoY +11.4%), offering a chance to add to a quality name on a sentiment-driven dip noted in market context.
*   **CRM**: Price ($165.84) is significantly below entry ($181.70) despite intact earnings growth (EPS YoY +18.3%), presenting a clear opportunity to average down on a core holding.

### Remove
*   **LRCX**: Spread >200% (Tier 4). Remove. Price has run far ahead of fundamentals, inverting the risk/reward.
*   **HON**: EPS YoY -41.9%, FCF YoY -352.3%, Rev YoY -6.9%. Remove. Thesis is broken across all key financial dimensions.
*   **BE**: Spread >1000% (Tier 4). Remove. Parabolic price move (+1330.9% vs_1Y) has exhausted the thesis; reflexivity risk is extreme.
*   **CAG**: Demote to WATCHLIST. Negative ROIC and collapsing QoQ earnings momentum undermine the `LOSER—EPS+` tag; this is a quality concern, not a temporary dislocation.
*   **Promote to PIPELINE: QCOM**: Now meets Tier 1 TAILWIND criteria with a Spread of -130.4% (EPS YoY +173.0% vs. vs_1Y +42.6%).
